anniversaryat AMD and every single moment of thosethree yearsI've been really excited in bringingcompute Solutions in partnership withGoogle Cloud to our customer base all ofyou guysI'll spend the next 30 to 35 minutes towalk you through all the GCE and gkesolutions powered by AMD epic CPUs inGoogle Cloudthat would leave us roughly about fiveto ten minutes in the endfor Q aand I recommend if I suggest if you canhold on to your questions till the endcome to the mic and ask your questionsthat way the broader audience will beable to listen to your question andwe'll have a more meaningful discussionwith that what are we waiting for let'sget startedbefore I actually dive into the AMD epicdriven GCE and gke Solutions in GoogleCloud let me give you a little bit ofoverview of AMD as a companyAMD is not only just a server CPUprovider anymorewe have established ourselves in thelast couple of years as true holisticdata center Solutions companystarting to the left if you see far leftit's the AMD epic line of server CPUstargeted towards Enterprise andCommercial HPC workloads both on-premand in the cloudwith generative AI large language modelsinference and training being the mosttalked about the most sought afterworkloadswe're very excited with the AMD Instinctline of gpusthey are really the Mi 250 in productionright now and Mi 300X coming out in Q4we are again very excited to really putthe solution in front of our endcustomers which is again targeting AIMLlarge language modelslast year we acquired two companiesxilinx which is the leading provider ofprogrammable fpga Solutions and adaptivesocs we acquired xilinxaround the first quarter of last yearand what that did for us is it increa itincreased or expanded our Damned fromjust server data center to like marketssuch as Telcomarkets such as embedded fintech so onand so forthwe also added pin Sandos which is aprogrammable P4 based smartnic dpucompany and what that did for us is itprovided us with a companion smart neckas companion chip which actuallyoffloads some of the infrastructureworkloads such as cryptostorage compression decompressionnetworking encryption decryption ituploaded the CPU and brought it into thesmartnet dpu which is P4 programmableagain and that leaves more cores for enduser applicationso this basically completed our holisticdata center solution kind of strategyand now we are in execution modeall right so in this session we're goingto mainly Focus out of the four uhSolutions I showed in the previous slidewe're going to mainly focus on the AMDepic line of server CPUsthere are lots of benefits multiplebenefits from the AMD epic architecturestarting with uh TCO if you look at AMDepic all the way from Naples to Rome toMilan and now to Genoa it provides thehighest x86 core density with theindustry leading performance per core ifyou multiply the core density per socketwith performance per core what thatgives you is an extremely compelling PCOwhich is not only beneficial to ahyperscaler Partners like Google Cloudbut a lot of that is passed on to theend customers in terms of eitherperformance per core or in terms ofdollar per VM and that if if you areoptimizing for cost that gives you anexcellent uh cost efficientinfrastructure if you're optimizing forperformance same thinga lot of Enterprises now are alsooptimizing I I the sustainability aspectof it their social responsibility aspectof it the Enterprises are not onlyoptimizing or reducing their scope 1 andscope 2 emissions they want to reallyoptimize their scope three emissions forworkloads they are migrated to CloudAMD epic CPUs with the latest tsmc 5nanometer technology and the chipletarchitecture is the most energyefficient x86 CPU that you'll find outthereso that's again a big Advantage from theAMD epic architecturenext is the ecosystemlots of Enterprises have been runningtheir x86 applications for 10 years 20years 30 yearsyou really did not want to go touchthose applications that have beenbringing business to you that have beeninterfacing to your customer base andadd risk and effort by putting that to adifferent architectureso AMD epic again based on the x86architecture and available in all GEOSwithin Google Cloud gives you that easeof migration for your workloads that youwere hosting on-prem but now you caneasily do that in the cloudlast but not the least confidentialcomputeverticals and markets such as HealthcareFSI public sector one of the keyhesitant hesitation in moving theworkloads to cloud is will my workloadbe secure will my application be securewill my application my data in the cloudbe secure so confidential compute inGoogle cloud is exclusively powered byAMD epic VMS both confidential VMS andconfidential containers Within gkeall right so now let's really go diveinto I'm going to skip this one reallydive into the different families uhcompute families we have powered by AMDepic in Google Cloud one size does notfit all anymore when we started ourjourney and our partnership with GoogleCloud we only had the general purposeVMS powered by second gen AMD epic codenamed Romeand since then we have gone from generalpurpose we have added to the portfolioof general purpose n2d VMS computeroptimize c2d VMSCloud native optimized Tau vmc 2D VMSand confidential VMS so starting withn2d VMS to your left these are reallytargeted towards your Enterprise liftand shift workloads such as web and appserverssmall to medium sized databases line ofbusiness applications like mediaencoding transcoding it really providesyou a very easy button lift and shiftfrom on-prem to Cloud for mainstreamEnterprise workloadsbut as I saidone size does not fit all when you lookat the cloud HPC Market which basicallyright now uh according to Hyperionresearch is about six to seven billiondollars and it is gonna go at a cargo ofabout 17 percent between now and 2026 toabout 11 to 12 billion dollarsyour commercial HPC applicationsAutomotive Aerospace r d designscomputational fluid dynamics drugDiscovery Oil and Gas and energyexploration these kind of workloadsreally require compute intensiveinfrastructure with very Ultra fast Highperforming cores the highest memorybandwidth per corehighest memory capacity per core andalso very tight very fast networking lowlatency networking for your tightlycoupled workloads that's where we kindof launched c2d VMS uh in 2021 inpartnership with Google Cloudnow right at that time we also realizedthat there is a need to really provide ahighest price performance Cloud nativeuharchitecture or VMS which are targetedtowards scale out workloads and AMD andGoogle Cloud combined and co-engineeredthis new family of VMS called Tau VMSt2d which was based on third generationAMD epic Milan and these provide up to42 percent betterprice performance and 56 percent betterperformance compared to any other VMSavailable on Google cloud or elsewhereand I kind of touched a little bit aboutconfidential compute both entity and c2dfamilies have confidential VM capabilityand feature support and alsoconfidential gkes supported on these twoVMSokaylet's kind of double click into each ofthese VM families starting with n2d Ijust mentioned that n2d is reallytargeted towards your mainstreamEnterprise workloadsuh web serving think about app servingJava applications think about databasesboth SQL and nosql think about uh justline of business applications like mediaencoding transcoding uh gaming and so onand so forthso these general purpose VMS entity westarted off with second gen epic withRome in 2020 and they were refreshedwith 3rd gen epic Milan in 2021 theseprovide these entity VMS general purposeVMS or the highest VM density or highestVM size you will find in Google cloudwith 224 vcpus as the highest VM sizethere are also 13 percent lower costcompared to comparable n-seriesinstances available on Google Cloudso again think about highest performingVMper core multiplied by lower 13 percentlower cost per VM really gives you thatTCO advantage that I was talking aboutearlierand if you see the charts to the rightwhat we did is we benchmarked entityMilan which is the third generation epicwith n2d ROM and it provides about 30percent Better Price performance forworkloads such as nginx databases MySQLso on and so forthso now let's talk about couple ofpartners and customers who have reallyleveraged and benefited from migratingto entity VMS sap which is the leadingEnterprise business software providerthink Erp CRM so on and so forth theychose entity VMS for their as a defaultfor their rise with sap programthe main reason why they chosen to doVMS was the price performance benefitand the global availability of these VMSthe other two customers I want tohighlight that really benefited andadapted the entity VMS is Salesforce weall know about Salesforce hereSalesforce for similar reasons to sapadapted entity VMS to host its industryleading Enterprise CRM SAS solution inGoogle CloudVimeo is a leading content and uh videoproviderit's also a SAS provider hosting onGoogle Cloud they saw 20 lowertranscoding time or faster transcodingvideo transcoding using n2d VMS comparedto the previous infrastructure they wereusing they also at the same time save 20cost while hosting on entity VMS onGoogle Cloudall rightso we talked a little bit about generalpurpose entity VMSlet's switch over to compute optimizedHPC focused c2d VMS these VMS again aretargeted towards more technicalworkloads which are very computeintensive computational fluid dynamicsfor automotive and Aerospace energyexploration for oil and gas weatherforecasting by by national agenciesthose are the workloads that are verycompute intensive Network intensivebecause they are tightly coupled andalso memory bandwidth intensiveso with c2dv ampsit's available it's also the highest VMsize as far as compute intensiveworkloads or VMS are concerned in GoogleCloud it provides up to 112 vcpus at thelargest size and you can rent out theentire node to really host in a soletenancy modejust like entity VMS compared to othern-series V and c2d VMS are also offeredby Google Cloud at 13 lower costcompared to comparable C Series VMSit also provides 30 Better Priceperformance compared to general purposeentity VMS as you could see from thechart to the rightbut more interestingly I want to kind ofquote two customers who benefited frommigrating to c2d VMS air shaper is anonline aerodynamic simulation platformcompanyand they saw 50 reduction in theiroverall simulation costs and 30 percentfaster simulation times when theymigrated to c2d VMS and clutch which isa marketing and data analytics companyproviding the features and dataanalytics features at real-timeanalytics to end Enterprises saw similarbenefits of adopting C to Don this slide let me sum up all thefeatures that are available on n2d andc2d starting with the top leftI mentioned earlier and we're going totalk a little bit about confidential VMSboth entity and c2d offerconfidential compute capability and compconfidential VMS and confidentialcontainer capability powered by AMDsecure encrypted virtualization saptechnology we're going to talk about itin just a little bitthey both also supportum 100 up to 100 gigabit per secondnetworking very fast networking whichprovides enough networking bandwidth percorereally required for HPC workloads in c2dand large size Enterprise workloads VMsize and n2dboth also offer local ssdsn2d offers up to nine terabytes of localssds and c2d offers up to threeterabytes of local ssds for our for yourreally IO iops intensive workloadsand finally both these are available insole tenancy configuration so if youbelong to an Enterprise which isconcerned about security fromneighboring VMS or multi in amulti-tenancy mode or let's say if yourEnterprise which you're mainly runningon-prem and you're doing lift and shiftto the cloud and bringing your ownlicense these VMS in a soul tenancy modeallows you more flexibility it allowsyou more direct lift and shift to GoogleCloudum compared to multi-tenancy optionsall rightso so far we talked aboutgeneral purpose and to dvmsand compute optimized c2d VMSlet's kind of double click a little bitabout these completely new family thatGoogle and AMD co-engineered which isthe Tau VMS t2dvmsthese are available from vcpu sizes from2 all the way to 60 vcpusand and again as I mentioned they wereco-engineered really to serve onepurposea lot of cloud native scale outworkloadsneeded a reason to really go migrate tothe cloud because obviously the cloudarchitecture provides that scale outcapability one of the key um blockers ifyou if I if you will were like does itprovide me the right price performanceso AMD and Google co-engineered thisfrom a performance site to provide theindustry best performance so it providesup to 42 sorry 56 up to 56 percentbetter performance compared to any otherVMS in gcp or elsewherebut to top it off and another icing onthe cake Google Cloudreally priced this very aggressively togive you up to 42 percent Better Priceperformance uh compared to any other VMSavailable elsewhere and you can see someof the charts to the right which showsthe price performance comparisonstwo of the leading social media andcollaboration companies Twitter now X ishosting on t2d VMS because of the priceperformance value prop we provide in thecloud native scale out capabilitybecause these these workloads theseapplications are very elastic in naturedepending on how much news how much uhusers are using it so they needed thatkind of flexibility at a good pricePerformance Point which was the mainreason that brought Twitter onto t2dsame with Snapchat snap really adaptedt2d technology or t2dvns exactly for thesame reasonsall right solet's recap we talked about generalpurpose and 2D VMS we talked aboutcompute optimized HPC c2d VMS we talkedabout Cloud native scale out Tau VMSone of the features that is exclusivelyavailable only on AMD VMS in Googlecloud is confidential compute what isconfidential computehistorically if you look at data and thejourney of data from on-prem to Edge toClouddata is moving it's in transit data isin rest at rest within the disks andnvmes but there's also data in use beingprocessed in the CPUsfor decades there have been Technologiesto really encrypt and secure both dataat rest and data in motion data inmotion is secured by ipsack kind of atthe network data at rest in the distancesecured by all the AES encryptionTechnologiesthe hole we had over here was how do yousecure the datain use or being processed the data anduse are being processed if you thinkabout multiple multi-tenancy VMS runningon the same hostyou need to make sure that your data inyour VM is protected and secured fromRogue in malicious VMS neighboring VMSand it's also protected from the Rogueand malicious hypervisor and also thezero trust model says that it needs tobe protected by your cloud serviceprovider and the Silicon provider likeGoogle cloud and AMD itself it's acompletely zero trust model that's whereamd's secure encrypted virtualizationSUV technologycomes to play and Google was the firsthyperscaler to adopt this SUV technologyand launch confidential VMS andconfidential compute containers based onthis technologywe can literally spend one hour goingdeep in depth but don't worry I'm notgoing to do thatlet me narrowed out of what SUV is whatSUV is is it provides within every AMDepic chip there is a hardware there's asecure processor which provides ahardware route of trust that encryptsthe data not only in the main memory butalso the data in the CPU registers thatis being processedit manages the hardware encryption Keyssuch that only the hardware knows whatthose keys are and your data centeroperator does not have access to thosekeys what that does is provides a zerotrust model uh to secure your Federateddata or your regulated dataI think the key points over here withoutgoing into the details is you guysprobably are not interested in thesausage making behind this but the keytakeaways from this is two things oneyou can enable Sev and confidential VMSand containers by a push button withinthe Google Cloud UIthere is no need to touch yourapplication code that you have beenrunning stably for 10 years 20 years 30years uh to make it secure just click abutton in your workload all the hardwareencryption root of Russia is enabled andall taken care of by Hardwareit provides confidentiality which meansnobody can go and steal your data itprovides and it provides secureIntegrity which means nobody can go andcorrupt your dataand it also provides attestation at ahardware route of trust levelthe last and final thing that you shouldremember iswe spend a lot of time benchmarking whatis the performance impact if you turn onThis SUV confidential compute featureand it is almost minimal to zero impacton your workload performance so you aregetting a lot of automated securitywithout having to give up too much onyour performance or at allsothere are a couple of things I want tomention here uh just what's availableavailable todaywith AMD SUV technology that providesyour confidentialityum confidentiality not Integrity yet isin general availability on entity andc2d VMS both confidential VMS andcontainers and what is in preview whichwas announced is SCV SNP which actuallyprovides the memory Integrity protectionwhat that means isnobody else a malicious hypervisor ormalicious VM or a data center operatornot only can they not steal your datathey can also not corrupt your data sothat was just announced it is in publicpreview and will go in GA very soon anduh SUV feature is available on n2d andc2d whereas the Sev SNP feature inpublic preview is enabled on n2d rightnowall right more importantlyI want to talk about couple of customerswho belong to a very regulated Federatedindustry AstraZeneca that we all knowabout is aHealthcare biosciences Company whoreally develops uh vaccines for manydifferent types of diseases they store alot of confidential client dataand it is of utmost importance for themthat that information is not leaked outthat information is not corrupted thatinformation is not stolenthey really Leverage The confidentialVMS for n2d and c2d to do that and iconis another blockchain FSI fintechcompany which really leveraged theconfidential VMS powered by AMD CVtechnology on Google Cloud as wellall right so so far just a quick recaptalked about history talked aboutAMD as a company as a solution providertalked about General per person to dvmstalked about compute optimize c2dvmstalked about Cloud native T to dvmstyped a little bit about confidentialVMS this brings us to the exciting newsfor this weekGoogle Cloud just announced yesterdaythat next gen general purpose VMS c3dVMS powered by amd's latest 4th gen epicCPUs code name Genoa so this wasannounced yesterday we are very excitedabout it before I get into c3d VMS andwhat it provides uh to you as a customerbase let me talk a little bit about uhGenoa firstGenoa is Industries highest core densityhighest performance per core x86 CPUit packs 96 up to 96 cores of highestperforming x86 course within a singlesocket and that's the part that has alsogone into the c3d VMSit also provides up to 9 2.9 terabytesof memory per nodeon top of it it provides 12 ddr5 memorychannels attached to the CPU providesthe highest memory bandwidth per socketand highest memory bandwidth per corethis is very critical for HPC workloadsand even some in-memory databasesand then there are 160 PCI 5 Lanes whichreally drives the highest iops availableon this platform for your i o intensiveworkloadsso I talked about c3d a little bit uhthis is in preview this will go intopreview very soon but uh it's availableuh in various shapes uh all the way upto 360 vcpus with 2.9 terabytes ofum of ram as I mentioned of ddr5 andit's 4800 Mega transfers per second isthe bandwidth or the speed uh and againtargeted towards your mainstream generalpurpose workloads so the first thing wedo when we get this is uh and sorrybefore I get there we also upped thetotal networking bandwidth on thiscompared to n2d it now offers 200gigabit per second networking bandwidthper node compared to 100 gigabit persecond that was there in n2d so if youadd uphighest number of course highestperformance per core 200 gigabit persecond networking fastest i o availableiops available that translates into realworld performance uplifts and webenchmarked this with the Google Cloudengineering team and we are seeing 45better performance on c3d VMS on anaverage across all the criticalworkloads like web serving engine Xin-memory caching databases like readersrelational databases like MySQL and Javaworkloads as benchmarked by spec jbb so45 average higher performance which is ahuge step function jump generationallycompared to the Milan based into dvmsall right so this is my last slideit's no good if we have great technologybut not available in your GEOS andregions so we work constantly andcontinuously with Google Cloud to reallygrow the footprint quarter of overquarter so with the exception of c3dwhich is just in preview right now allof our other VMS are available inmultiple GEOS across the world whereveryour Enterprises or your data centeroperations are and with c3d nowannounced in preview and going in GAsoon you will see a lot moreavailability for c3d to a data centernear youthank you"
