    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good morning everyone how's it goingwelcome to the second day of next and toour encryption breakout session keys tothe kingdom thank you so much for comingmy name is Marcus Hartwig I'm a productmarketer here at Google Cloud securityandit's Now official data is the mostvalued resource in the world it'sactually a head of oil according to theeconomist but I think that mostly peoplehere in the room will agree with me whenI say that not only is data just avalued resource it is in fact somethingthat is quite critical for mostbusinessesand that's why I compose such a hugerisk if it were to be processed orhandled oroperated Pawn in a way that goes againstcompliance and regulation or if it waseven misplaced or leaked summernow here at Google Cloud we've designedand built our cloud from the ground upwith security and privacy in mindwe have a wide variety of features andcontrols to help you keep your datasecure in Google cloud and we trulybelieve that the best place and the mostcost effective way to secure that datais to have it in our cloudnow one of the most powerful controlsthat you can have when it comes to datasecurity is of course data encryption weoffer data encryption for data intransitdata at rest and data in usenow data encryption of data in transitis really valuable if you want toprotect that data as it moves from yourdevices to Google Cloudan encryption of data at rest is reallyimportant when you want to protect thedata that is being stored in GoogleCloudbut equally important is protection ofdata in usewith protection on an encryption of datain use you can protect your data as itis being used by Google cloud servicesand that's really important because youwant to be able to use your data as itstays secured for things like indexingor training or inference of AI and mlmodelsso data encryption in a nutshell isessential for protecting your data fromunauthorized access but it's really onlyas good as if you have control over theencryption keys that sort of lock inthat encryption of data now we offer awide variety of of features and andcontrols for Key Management Solutions sothat you can select the one that bestfits your organization and your ownneedsbut not only that we also want to makeit easy and intuitive to use so thatanyone can take advantage of theseofferings and security controls eventhose who are not cryptographers atheart so developers or regularly justCloud users for uswe've made a large amount of very verygoodincrements and product improvements toour KMS portfolio over the year andwe're incredibly excited to tell youabout them so I'd like to invite NellyPorter on stage and she can tell youwhat we have going on welcome Nellythank you so much Marcusat least we clap done hello thank you somuch can you hear me first of all talkabout it okaythank you so much for coming I'm NellyPorter I own encryption end-to-end andgcp in Googleand today I am going to tell you a lotof interesting stories so Story numberonemy customers coming to us and sayingOkay Googlethey need to not only protect our datawith your very important encryption keysbut we also need to make sure that wecan perform the basic data life cycleoperation like delete my dataor do data retention policy or wipe outmy data and again for all of you thatbrave enough to attend our sessionunderstand that encryption is probablythe best tool to accomplish that becauseinstead of hunting for every single filea single object or every single table indata sets you can simply delete the keysand get this data deleted but thenyou need to own those keysand it's exactly what we want to offeryou without cloud Key Managementsolutionso as you would expect from cloud KMS nosurprisewe really solid cloud and mature nativeservicewe have ability to be Global wheneveryou want uswe actually have not only Globaldeployment but reliability scalabilityavailability is of all things that youneedvery recently we are announcing newservices in area of transparency andit's called key tracking and it'sabsolutely trivialall of you told us okay we need toensure that those keys is actuallyassociated with those objects how do Iknow that those objects is actuallyprotected by those keys and some of younot you in the audience decided to goand delete some keys without very clearvalidation that then you actuallydistract your data and destruct yourdata such ways that it's not recoverableso being able to see being able to trackthe keys and resources and those keysprotecting is critical and we have thiscapability for you but as usual we don'tstop thereand again what we were thinking aboutand it's one additional customer Told MeNelly it took me actually two months intwo seconds to put two objects under thecloud bucketand I was like it's impossible twomonths and two seconds and they said yeshere's the story to create the keyyou need to have the biggest admin inthe world key admin creating those keysand it happened in Europe again some ofyou from Europe the patience is reallyreally lowso when my developer came and trying toput these two objects onto the bucketthe key was not ready for them becauseto create key you need to have this verypowerfulhe had been creating this key for thisdeveloper so it took us two months andtwo seconds to create this key andunblock this developerand we're like okay our currentexperience is exactly as you see on thescreen select the key because this keyhave to be created but this key adminbut what we're thinking about thecreation of the keys is something thateverybody in your organization can dobut you need to define the policy andwhat type of key what type ofcryptography you need to go is it whattype of in rotation policy everything soit is whytoday we're introducing Key Managementautopilot and it's exactly what youexpect Key Management auto pilot isactually learned from all of you whatkeys you creating day and night weunderstand this confidence of99.99999 99 that it's exactly the keythat you needand we will create those key for you onbehalf with you fully controlling whatkeys and how to manage those keys wealso will support and continuesupporting he managed encryption keys orCMAC as we call when you control everysingle step on the way but we add inthose autopilot keys for you so yourdeveloper would not wait two months andtwo seconds to put those objects underthe bucket and would be able to continuewhat they need in line with the resourcecreationand let me show you is the experiencethat you will have and let me see thatit's playing so instead of selecting thekeyevil Health ability to surprise createthe key and we will create this key andwe will create this key the best that wehave in our possession and it will beHardware based HSM based keys and youwould be able to update it change it todo what you need you would have all ofthis power in your hands and you willnot spend significant amount of time ofcreating those keys and also afterthose keys will be created sorry it's avideo is like out of sync you would beable to see it in our key trackingdashboards see those keys are createdso welcome to Key Management autopilotwe absolutely looking forward for yourfeedback and it's the service that wewill offer in preview and we will bringit to General availability very soonso it's actually something that customertold us Nally it's taken usquite a bit of time to create all ofthose thousands keys and we're spendingyearsso we actually a lot lots experiment andVilla love a lot of dataso we send our developers to figure outhow long it will create one key how longit will take them even people that knowthis stuffto create this keyapproximately 10 12 minutesso Marcus do you know how many keys weare actually creating per yearso actuallytens of millions of keysso take your 12 minutesmultiply by again let's take 25 mL ofkeys we're coming to586 yearswe spend it over six centuries on keycreation operation we next year going togive all of this time back to you sothose key advancements finally would beable to take vacation and don't worrythat the organization will stopcompletely stop of doing what they needor Story number twohe's a fantastic but we need reallyreally strong protection of those kidswe have software protection and we haveHardware protectionand this is recommending that Hardwarekeys are becoming more of default orpreferred option for our customers sowhat we will dowe actually havea service for all of youcalled Cloud HSM and Cloud HSMlet me bring it to the screenis actually exactly what it saidIt's ability for us to generate andperform our operation in boundaries ofcloud data terms and usually when youhear about Cloud digitam those numbersis thrown at youfips140-2-3 L2 L3 and it's like bunch ofnumbersfor some of you they're joining thissession probably you have very clearunderstanding what is the differencesbut I want to make very clear Point herethe difference between L2and L3temper evidence and temper resistanceand temper evidence in normal humanlanguage sorry we're trying to translateit a little bitmeans that when things happenedand somebody modify or get againmalicious access to those devices afterthe fact the devices will report to youand saying congratulation this happenedtemporary system means that thosedevices are built such way that theywill resist those changes and it's hugedifference it's why V in Google believethat when we're talking about Hardwarewe're really talking about those verystrong HSM capabilitiesnextnext story customer saying fantastic sowe have Hardware protection we havesoftware protection we have sexautopilot keysbut now sometimes we need to hold ourown Keys close to us we need to haveability to keep and generate those keysand perform the operation on those keysoutside of Google cloud and we hear andwe delivered we have what we call Cloudexternal key manager so story and itmeans you would be able to do it outsideof cloud perform your cryptographicoperation and keep your keys foryourself managing by yourselfthere's the same experiences that wehave today with customer managedencryption key autopilot keys will notbe supported for eqmso and thencloudy Kim is also adding very importantcapabilitywe called it key approval justificationwhen you have ability to tellif you accept the access to those keysor notso you're putting this the whole entirepolicy layer here to make decision ifyou allow us to perform this operationbased on our justifications that weprovide or you actually deny access tothe keys so you're not only holdingthose keys In This Cloud ekm capabilitybut you also have the entire policylevel and controls to save photo accessand what are notgreatso then my customer said fantasticwe have ability to protect our data atrestbut cloud and Google is not thegraveyardwe need this data to be processed weneed this data to be used for our gen AImodels we need this data to be used forour training our serving it's all whatwe need so how we will ensure that theencryption capabilities that we haveaddressed will continue to be preservedwhen we trying to process this data andthen Google in 2020introduce the first product inconfidential Computing spaceand confidential Computing space allowus to provide very strong isolationcapabilityso when you bring in your workloads tous you have this virtualizationisolation capability that provided byour hypervisor with confidentialComputing using extensions of CPU ofthose vendors we started with AMD and bythe way Intel is coming as well be ableto create cryptographic isolationbetween different tenants and betweenyou and us Google to ensure that ourzero days will not be able to interruptor influence what is happening in yourworkloads and it is done because of keysbut those keys is the best keys that youwant to dream about because it's createdby the Asic this again silicon devicethat we have on our motherboard by AMDor again other vendors and those keysare staffed into memory controllers sowe were able incredibly fast to encryptdecrypt our memory when applicationtrying to access itand after the data is decrypted it's putall thebus lines for CPU to perform operationsand after that it's encrypted back soit's always encryptedand the beauty of this system is thatyour application doesn't need to changeas soon as it's running in thoseboundaries in This ConfidentialComputing environments and those teesit's completely can access everythingthat it needs to access but as soon asyou're trying to do exactly the sameoperation outside of boundary of yourconfidential environment you will seecyber textbut the keys as I said is a Paramountit's ephemeralit's never stored it's Unique for yourconfidential environment and it's alsothe most important fact not exportableand it means not us Google not you ourdear customers would be able to getaccess to this Keys it's the best keysto have my opinionso we introduced confidential VMSand after that we bring to youconfidential gke our kubernetes managedServices Google kubernetes engine toensure that you would be able to createthe whole entire cluster of thoseconfidential environments ofconfidential nodes or node poolsassociated with this clusterand after that customers said okayfantastic but what about Hadoop whatabout spark what about beam what aboutall of this data analytics Services wealso process so much sensitive datathere when we need to do what we need todo where the confidentiality in that andit's why we also brought to Generalavailability confidential data procthink about spark Hadoop map reduce andexactly what you ask confidential dataflow our beam ability to for you toprepare your data before you will bedoing inference training or anythingelse with that so Mr sings God we haveall of that but they didn't stop rightthereStory number five customer said Nellyfantastic thank you so much forisolating us so well we not onlyisolated through virtualization layersbut also through cryptographycryptographic layers but we need tocollaboratewe need to calibrate among multiplecompanies and sometimes those companiesis actually competitors so we can't jointhe data we can't do confidential matchwhat do we do and it's exactly whatwe've done by introducing confidentialspaceconfidential space is the capabilitythat built specifically for thosecustomers that need to join sensitivedata that they couldn't do beforewe have very interesting customers anddoing money laundering validationbecause you can't figure out moneylaundering or double spend if you'reonly processing your own data you needto combine the data from multipleFinancial companies financialinstitutions to be able to do that buthow you will do it because all of themcompete with each other none of themtrust each other so confidential spaceis a solution for this problem becauseconfidentials face in addition tointerpreting confidentialityit's offering protection againstworkload owner it means irrespectivelyif you're running this workload youwould not be able to modify it you onlywould be able to start it and kill itnothing else and it's how you would beable to guarantee that all of you wouldbe able to communicate and collaboratesecurelyso fantastic one more thing I forgot tomention one more announcement that wewant to makemore than two years we work in thesefintech companies they're trying tobring to the clouds of paymentapplications and it's everything we askour customers to do when they modernismthey're changing the environments weasking them to lift and shift to theirapplication and bring it to the cloudif he also asking them to lift and shiftthe data to bring it to the cloud thequestion is what to do with those HSMdevices that you need to perform yourpayment operation because those paymentHSM is very special devices please don'tleave them behindwe're offering a new service in gcpcalled bare metal HSM for payments andthe idea of this service is exactly whatyou will ask we will take those hsmsfrom your handsPCI certification is actually changedrecently allow you to remote administersthose boxes and it means you canpick them up if they support remoteAdministration and bring it to usand we will do what we need to do withthose wonderful devicesand it will be fully certified facilitywith all of our expertise to help andtake care of those devices you also cango and buy those HSM from your vendorsbecause we strongly believe you havestrong relationship with thoseHSN payment companiesso what we will do because we will bringit in our Google extensions and we canguarantee that the latency of thoseoperations will say well exactly whatyou expect and it's the most importantthing and it's yeah it's physics it'sspeed of light you need to bring theboxes closer to your workloads to ensurethat it has not more than five eightmilliseconds latency we want to ensurethat we will be scalable reliable andhelping you to bring your paymentsapplications and your payment HSMtogetherwe also will be able to work with you ifyou have to bring General crypto hsms aswell so we are not only talking aboutpayment hsms but it's probably the mostcritical ask that we hear from all ofyou todayand I'm done back to you mark thank youso much Nellynowbecause I'm staying[Laughter]none of these hardware-based solutionswould have been possible whatsoeverwithout our technology partners and weare lucky to have two of them here todayso I'd like to invite Todd Moore andAdam Cason on stage from Tallis and fromfuture Xhi everyone thank you so much for cominggood morningwhere do we standit's changed I gotta stand under yourpicture yeah there you goso Todd would you mind just taking aminute and tell us a little bit aboutThomas for those who are not familiar Iknow we go way back between Google cloudand sure so good morning everyoneum from Talus for those of you don'tknow who Talus is we're a large globalcompany based in Paris France we do alot of different things we buildsatellites we were part of the Marsrover project we build airplanes andsubmarines and things like that we alsohave a very large digital securitybusiness where we do a bunch of bankingcards credit cards as well as cybersecurity and that's where I'm from anduh we've been working with Google for avery long period of time reallyappreciate the partnership uh we're aGoogle customer Google Cloud customerand I think what we found working withGoogle is we had a lot of expertise anda lot of things that Nelly talked aboutin terms of external key management andhsms we're really focused on digitalsovereignty being a paris-based companya European based company we get askedhow do you meet digital sovereigntyrequirements around the world soleveraging some of the constructs thatGoogle has we've been working togetherfor a long time we kind of I think of asa yin yang Google's really good at whatyou do from the infrastructureperspective and we try to bring what wedo from an encryption and Key Managementperspective an external Key Managementperspective so thank you guys for havingus here yeah thanks for coming Adam afew tricks one of our our newer Partnersin the portfolio I would say I've heardabsolutely well thank you Marcus thankyou Nelly it's been a pleasure beinghere so my name is Adam Cason I handlePartnerships and alliances at futurexand what we do is focus primarily aroundEnterprise Key Management dataprotection Hardware security modules forboth payment and general purpose but asfar as the Google relationship here andour Focus there we've centered thataround a few different use cases Cloudekm that we've talked about here todayGoogle workspace client-side encryptionas well and also the bare metal HSM forpayments that we've discussed today soyou know we're looking forward really todiscussing those and how all of thoseinterplay with one another and formreally over ecosystem herethank you so much for coming as well sowe've talked a lot about paymentcustomers and what makes their needs sospecial when it comes to to Hardwaresecurity modules as opposed to any othercustomer and I like to read that one toosure so umuh from a from a payment HSN perspectiveand this is an exciting time with Googleis there's really three you know itpayment HSN is a specialized HSM and itreally I guess three characteristics andAdam love to hear your opinion as welltoo but it really is around payments andcompliance uh you hear about PCIum you know the payment industry isalways updating the regulation andcompliance you got to make sure thatyour HSM is a part of that compliancechain is certified to the lateststandards so compliance is a very bigimportant part when it comes to paymentsthe second element and Nelly touched onthis is speed it's latency so a lot offolks all of us when we go buy somethingwith our credit card or our phone weexpected that payment transaction isgoing to happen relatively quickly andit's just one use case but you want thelatency and the time for that to berelatively quick so there is a latencycomponent and I guess the third aspectwhen it comes to payment functions andthey are very unique is you want yourapplications not to change I mean thereare payment applications out there thathave been around for a long time as youwrite new applications you want a veryrobust API application programminginterface so that your legacyapplications as well as your newapplications can interact with those newpayment functions so payment HSM is aunique a unique Beast I guess I wouldsay and as Nelly had said earliercustomers have asked us how can weleverage our Legacy payment applicationsget performance and latency and be ableto get the compliance in a cloudenvironment and with bare metal I thinkwe're being able to do that with Nellyso but Adam I I might go ahead I didn'tdo anything or no that's that's honestlyit's spot on I think you look at thecompliance you look at the speed thoseare two big areas of very very importantFocuspayments and the use of Hardwaresecurity modules in payments is one ofif not the oldest use case for them andso there's a lot of Legacy historybehind all that a lot of reasons whythings are done certain ways from KeyManagement from processing fromalgorithms key derivation methods allthese different things but I think twoadditional things that really matter inpain moments more than a lot of otherareas and workload confidentiality datacriticality is important everyorganization has their own type of datano matter what vertical you're in thatis that mission critical datapayments though you're dealing with datathat crosses not only your ownorganization's boundary but also a lotof other stakeholders out there you'vegot the card issuing Bank you've got theorganizations that process that datayou've got Merchants you've got the endconsumer with their own payment data allof that in the event of a breach oranything like that there's a lot ofSplash damage from that and the riskfactors that come from that and thedesire for everybody not to end up onthe front page of the Wall StreetJournal really is why the payment HSMecosystem exists in the way it does oneof the reason why as Todd saidcompliance PCI Phipps like Nelly wassaying earlier are so important is justpackaging up everything in a way thatmatters from a compliance standpointbut one of the other things we're seeingthese days that I think is particularlyinteresting is a convergence ofdifferent data types and different meansof data protection almost into singleecosystems where you don't as oftennowadays see people dividing outworkloads or data types into payments orgeneral purpose or their pki reallyforward-thinking organizations areviewing those as part of the sameoverall ecosystem it's now seeing what'sgoing on with bare metal HSM forpayments building on some of the otherconfidential Computing Cloud HSM CloudKey Management all of this fits into thesame overall ecosystem I think lookingat it from that direction really is whatwe're seeing trending wiseokay but let's take a step back and andwhy areyou think about Hardware based controlswhy are they so important overall in inthis space and I'll I'll let you startAdam I'm fair enough yeah well I meanbuilding again on what Nelly saidearlier it's it's all about that tamperevidence and tamper responsiveness theidea being that you take yourcryptographic keys that are protectingyour most sensitive data really whateverthat data is the data type doesn't evenmatter but you take the keys that arebeing used to encrypt that data tovalidate that data to sign that data andyou house those keys inside a tamperevident tamper responsive ecosystem youensure protection not only from outsidethreats this handled using thealgorithms the cryptographic techniquesthat we're all familiar with but youalso protect from Insider threats youprotect from tampering with thatphysical device itself as such thatnobody even people in your ownorganization even your most trustedsecurity admins and employees have noway to ever get to those keys in theclearyeah noI agree with everything you said Adam Iguess whenever you talk about Hardwarebased controls and hsms uh the first Hin HSM is Hardware just you know so it'spretty evident that we want to make surethat we're really protecting our in veryimportant critical Keys as you said Adamand and hardware and so I think havingthe right side of controls and we allhear about different types of breachesand hacks that occur where a lot ofthose very important credentials andencryption keys are in software and it'seasy for hackers to get those and oncethey have it they have the keys to thekingdom as we call this uh the sessiontoday so I think hardware-based controlsare important not from a complianceperspective but also just from a bestpractice a best security practiceperspective to make sure that you putall that in critical information insidethat safe called an HSM and Hardwareokay Nelly thank you so much the onlythings that I will add Hardware alsohave really small what they call trustedComputing basethe amount of software or the amount offirmware that running in Hardwarecontrols is very limited and as a resultof that as usual as most stuff you runas most stuff you need to trust withhardware and Hardware capability andthis former and this very limitedfunctions that specifically designed forthose separation we ensure all of usthat the hardware is used exactly asit's supposed to be through enormousamount testing pen testing Etc and it iswhy we believe that Hardware isproviding very strong additional layerof protection for everything that we doand it's the same not only with husounds the same is with confidentialComputing why a very reliant on HardwareCPU extension and Hardware capability tocreate this opportunity for us to offerthis functionality to you so absolutelyHardware is interesting this combinationwith the right software and former weprovide really strong securityassurances for all of youexcellent now Nelly we talked a lotabout making this more accessible andintuitive to use so what would you saywhat are some of the sort of thingswe're doing to make the complexity of adata security strategy a little bit moreyou know on the table for mostorganizations I thinkKey Management autopilot is going tosimplify your life enormouslyforward for your early feedback on thiscapability because againcryptography is complicated and I'm sureall of us love to talk aboutcryptography but making any mistakes inthis space is really very creates hugeconsequencesand the second one usability withoutsecurity is absolutely not even the sameagain I can give you a few millions ofexamples and fantastic security neverprovided first of all protection butalso it didn't meet their expectationand probably some things that you superfamiliar with it's called multi-factorauthentication huhwe love multi-factor authentication youknow how many years we as securityCommunity trying to ensure that ourusers our customers are not relying onpasswords aloneI don't know probably 20 years 25 yearsand it's still again so complicated tohave this second factor and set factorand whatever end Factor available for usfor employees for users for everybody sosecurity and data protection withoutusability simply would not fly it willnot work and this is why Google was oneof the first that tried to makeconfidential Computing is well usablecompared to whatever was possible beforeit was a lot of security and very veryfew attention to usability now the wholeindustry is working to ensure that yourapplications do not need to change theway how you operate Machinery doesn'tneed to change and we creating theenvironments that will fit your needsinstead of otherwise around so beabsolutely Paramount on making thisusable for you and we will continue tolisten to your feedback and make ourstory even betteryeah well I'll just thanks Nelly thatwas perfect I'll just add that I thinkMarcus started off this presentationtalking about data there's so much databeing generated and it's sprawling allover the placeum from our perspective my perspectivegetting control of your data sprawl isthrough controlling the keys that areencrypting that data you want to findout where that critical data is you wantto encrypt you want to maintain thoseencryption keys I think from acomplexity perspective it's really beingable to centralize and manage those keysand I think from all of you it's witheverything the tools that are madeavailable to you so with Googleworkspace you can use client-sideencryption today when it comes to GoogleCloud we've got external Key Managementwe've got CMAC customer managedencryption Keys we also have a hold yourown key or external Key Management we inbeccued as data encryption the idea iscloud service providers like Google giveyou those tools that when you're usingtheir service they can use the KeyManagement Services as well too so tomake it maybe as a first step and Ithink that was the question mark is youknow how do you how do you move in toactually coming up with the datasecurity strategy leverage the toolsthat are given to you start leveragingthose external Key Management thosecentralized Key Management tools andthen over time you'll start to add moreuse cases but the csps Google inparticular it's giving you all the allthe technology that you need to reallyget a start when it comes to protectingyour information from a data securityperspective so hope that's useful maybetoo high level but uh Adam go ahead no Iwould I would agree with all that and II think one of the barriers historicallyto implementing strong encryption and agood robust data protection strategy hasbeen around complexity or or maybeperceived complexity of it and and it istough and one of the challenging thingsthat I've seen historically is thatorganizations may be very very quick toto buy Solutions or services or thingslike that but then actually developingthe skill set within their employee baseand maintaining that to actually handlethe care and feeding of these devicesthese Technologies sometimes they alittle bit in that and that that canactually produce some unintended risksif they think they're in a secure spotbut in reality well maybe they're notquite where they need to be and you knowfor me that's one of the things I'mexcited about about some of these newtechnologies is that it takes some ofthat workload burden off the Endcustomer it says all right here arethings that we can do that we know wecan make decisions easier and presentthat to the end user and I think thatultimately will result in a lot greateradoption of these Technologies a lotgreater protection of that sensitivedata and hopefully a little bit of timesaved along the way toowell like I said before none of thiswould have been remotely possiblewithout the great partnership betweenour company so thank you so much forthank you guys thank you for joining us[Applause][Music]"
