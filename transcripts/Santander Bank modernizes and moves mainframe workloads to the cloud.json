Mainframe modernizationumwe'll talk about Santander's journey tomoving Mainframe workloads to Cloudbut before that let me just brieflyintroduce you to the other two speakerswith me first is Alejandro fromSantander he is the director of thegravity project in Santander and he'spart of the CIO team and he'll betalking to us today about you know theirexperience and journey to actuallymigrating Mainframe workflows to gcpalong with them is Brian Lee who is theChief Architect for dual run withinGoogleand myself rajeshram chandran I lead theMainframe modernization practiceglobally in Google rightso for as far as an agenda is concernedum I have three topics thereinitially I want to talk about theMainframe modernization approach from aGoogle point of view what we think aboutit how we approach it what we've heardfrom customers and how we want tohow we tell customers to approach theirproblems second is I'll double click alittle bit under Google Solutions I knowthe 45 minutes is not enough time toactually do justice to all the topicshere so we'll be glad to have somefollow-up sessions with you guys toanswer any more questionsthird Santander will talk about theirJourney so that will be the thirdsession that will be there and thenwe'll have about 10 minutes for Q a andagainsince there's a lot of people here youknow there's more questions we canalways have a follow-up session with youguysso Mainframe modernization from a Googlepoint of view rightso I don't know how many of you haveactually stuck in this island that wesee rightfrom a Mainframe point of view a lot ofcustomers have been building this it's agreat platform by the way right I meannothing wrong about the platform it's aphenomenal platform it's run scorebusinesses for a lot of customersand you know I've worked on the platformin the past and I understand the valueof the platform butmodern days people are looking to seehow to improve efficiency increaseproductivity create valueDrive Innovation reduce costwhile they want to do this thechallenges that customers have right isI mean pretty sure a lot of you canrelate to these challenges rightTalent drain costyou know shrinking talent poolbut while you have all of thesechallenges customers also want tomigrate or modernizepretty quickly off the Mainframe rightthey don't want to take 10 years 15years to migrate what they've built over50 years right so they want to do thatmuch faster and of course they want todo minimal riskthey want to be cost effectiveand then on top of itthey want the same qualities of servicethat the Mainframe is famous for rightthat's very important I just want tostress on one thing about gcpwhile Mainframe has extraordinaryqualities of service gcp also has thesame similar qualities of servers rightjust like how if you run a program onthe main Mainframe you inherit all thecapabilities of the Mainframe from ahigh availability point of viewfrom our security point of view all ofthat you get the same qualities ofservice on gcp just by putting someworkload on gcp you inherit a lot ofinfrastructure capabilities that Googlehas built so that's a very importantpoint that I wanted to stress onnow how do we approach this problem forcustomersrightto be honest there's no one singlesolution or a silver bullet for a lot ofcustomers right it's a modernizationjourney that we talk aboutso we always start from the first thingthat a lot of customers that we talk tois about augmenting the Mainframe and Ithink a lot of you are already doingthat from a fact of API enablement ofthe Mainframe that's always been done sothat's one thing that we encouragecustomers to continue to do that whereit's appropriatethe bigger thing that we're talkingabout ismoving data or copying data fromMainframe into gcp there's a lot ofbenefits for that because once you movethe data or copy the data over to Cloudnow you can actually build lot moreAnalyticsa lot moreapplications Cloud native applicationson gcp right it's easier to access thedata that's in files vsam files andthings like that which are veryproprietary to the Mainframe right soyou get rid of all of that with this butyou can still keep your Mainframerunning in the meantime yeah your coresystem of record is still there rightbut this enables you to react faster tothe time to the businessgive you new value you know new thingsto the businessthe second thing and we have a solutionfor that which is called the Mainframeconnector right which is actually anopen source solution and I'll doubleclick into that in the next few slidesthe next thing is there are somecustomers who come to us and say Hey Iwant to quickly get out of my datacenterright they have a data center exitstrategy and they want to be host theirinfrastructure by Google right so withthat with respect to thatwe have a solution called ip4g it's IBMpower for Google which is actually aimedat AIX and as boundary workloadswhile for the Mainframe we don't have anofficial offering yet we are workingwith Partners you know a lot of Partnershere like Kindle and DXE and web Pro andothers to actually help host theseworkloads in data centers close toGoogle Cloudright and that will help customers exitthe data centerthe next one is a re-platform solutiona lot of customers come to us and sayhey I'm pretty happy with it being inCobalt but the cost Factoris pretty hugefor me I'm playing IBM a lot of moneyI'm paying the isvs a lot of money socan you help me stay on Cobalt can youhelp me move to Cloud as the first stepin the modernization journey right withrespect to that we have a re-platformingsolutionwhich is called dual run and I'll clickgo into it in a little bit detail andthat helps you accelerate the journey tore-platforming okay typically I don'twant to steal Brian and you know Santaand this is thunder so I'll let themdescribe that solution and actually howit actually workswith respect to thatthen the next one is refactor we haveGooglesolution which is G4 which is codeconversion so there are a lot ofcustomers who come to us and say hey Idon't want to be in Cobalt anymore Ihave no TalentI'm struggling to react to business veryquickly right so can I move to Javaquickly but I have a million lines ofcode or 10 million lines of code if I godown the rewrite path it's going to takeme a long time right and so we have asolution which is called G4 which wekind of acquired three years ago fromCornerstone and we've actually itactually takesthe code converts into Java we can runin containers now what it buys you isyou're on on gcp in a cloud nativeenvironment modern tooling access tomore skills the other important thing isyou know a lot of Enterprises 70 80percent of the code is not maintained ona regular basisright you know on in the Mainframe only20 30 percent is maintained what thisallows you is to get quickly off theplatformand then you can focus on the 20 30percent and do a rewriteby the way I don't know how many of youwereand attended the key developer Keynoteall right not many okay I don't knowinitially when I joined Google I wasalways thinking about you know Mainframeand Google in the same sentenceI was not sure whether they'll ever bethere but then I heard the rootsactually making a hip-hop thing aboutMainframe so I was like okay we are coolright now right so that was actually abigsurprise for me to say okay even theroots know about Mainframe right nowlastly we are you know a lot ofcustomers and I've talked to a few ofthem even in this conference theyactually want to reimagine and changetheir business processes and actuallybought undergo digital transformationGoogle helps with respect to that rightwith respect to rewriting and in boththese Solutions one important aspectthat you see there isthere's this gen AI piece that was addedright it was not there before to behonest right but as the buzzword andeverybody is very interested in gen AIright now we've started exploring thatright now and we will actually havesomething out pretty soon that you cansharewhy we have all of our Solutions we alsohave partner Solutions along the waynow I'm just going to go quickly throughsome case studies herewe've had some customers that we haveactually had success withuh bovista is a public customerreference Eric is a public customerreference where we actuallygot them off the got Mainframe workloadrunning on gcp using different solutionswe also have a data first solution withone of the largest retailers in theworld in fact the Mainframe connectorwas built there and actuallyopen sourced after that and then ofcourse we just recently did a refactorwith G4 for a large global bank from anas200 platform and got it out on GoogleCloudnow from Google Solutions point of viewthis is the augment solution that we'retalking about where we tell customers asa strategy please copy your data ontogcp becauseit helps you build lot more newapplications on gcp much faster Cloudnative and all of this and also the rateat which innovation happens on the cloudis much faster than what you can geton-prem so you can have vendors who giveyou analytic Solutions but the rate atwhich the Innovation happens on cloud ismuch faster so this is actuallysomething that's very important that youcan take a look at we have a variety ofpartner Solutions as well that weactually recommend working with to helpyou move in case you need CDCnextthis is just a detailed description ofwhat the solution is all about theMainframe connector actually helps youmigrate data as long as you can get thedata into a flat file with a Cobalt copybook we can actually help you migrate ina batch oriented way to gcp intobigqueryright so this is a pretty standardsimple solutionyou know it'll take you one month toactually get this up and running andyou're done right so it's prettyrepetitive in case you need CDC then youstart looking at partner Solutionstalking about G4 I just want to put oneslide about G4 our approach is codeconversion and our Target is kuberneteson the left side you see all thelanguages the things that we currentlysupport as a toolon the right side is the target platformthat we aim for right it's spring bootangular containerizedJava batch running in kubernetesthat's our Target platformso nowkubernetesand the reason we didn't go to Cloud runright now is some customers don't wantCloud run because it's actually runningoutside of their control in a tenant ingcp so that's one of the reasons why wechose kubernetesbut it very well could run on cloud runthere's nothing stopping therenow Brian over to you for dual runthank youthis tour one so there are manychallenges and opportunities inmonolizing your legacy applications soyou have a Mainframe on the left and youhave a customers and otherorganizations try to use your Mainframetrusted the Mainframe and also Mainframesend out some outputs right with thesolid line it works it mitsubishin isbut when it comes down to the themodernizing the application especiallyin the Mainframe modernization there aretwo challenges right one of the manychallenges I would say is testabilitywhether it can be tested and alsowhether it can be validated functionallyand non-functionally this is trustedplatform right you want to have aability to test it in realenvironmentalongside with the production Mainframeand then you want to be able to see thebehavior of the new system functionallynon-functionally along with in parallelwith Mainframe right so there are twotypes of workload and you will have tomigrate the application firstso we will have application on gcpassisted with our AMSwe have aautomation suite for you to migrate andassisting in migrating to your existingapplication assets to gcp when that'sdone there are two types of workloadfirst one would be typical batch wherebatch job schedule will handle all theschedules and everything you will have asimilar or the same scheduler on gcp soyou will be able to run it on gcp butwill give you an ability to compare theoutputs and set up to your keyperformance metrics indicators that youcan keep track of in seeing it throughthe monitoring capability right thenthere will be your onlineyou have interactive customers coming inour launcher willtaken care of sending out the sametransaction into your Mainframe with thesolid line to gcp the dotted linemeaning this our gcp system will berunning in alongside with the Mainframebut it will compare the output for youso that you will be able to see theorder online behaviors includingfunctional non-functional Behaviorthrough a single pane of glass so sothat you'll be able to see it throughthe monitoring so that you'll be able tosee the all the workload and behaviorin a single pane of glass almost realtime rightso thenwe have another last concept is you'rerunning two systems independently theremay be some discrepancies not comingfrom the defectbut sometimes time differences a littlebit of you know dispatching issues andsuch so we'll have a little bit ofdiscrepancies but you will have to usethe Mainframe as a system of record sothat we will be able to reconcile littledifferences to the secondary which is ongcp so the the comparison everythingwill keep going on without incurring anytoo much discrepancies that's the basicconcept the last one is the messagecoming out or buys coming out from twosystems out to the world we will also beable to compare it and set up kpis sothat you will be able to keep monitoringit so that's the basic concept then whenit comes down to how we can be donesmooth transition to the gcp right thefirst one is as it is you have aMainframe trusted Mainframe serving thepublic and business then we will beengaging to a run the same way I justpresented it but you see this solidlines every interaction from in and outfrom the Mainframe will be receiving bythe outside customers so there will beno impact but your new modernized systemwill be running concurrently during thecomparison until you fine tune it youcorrect any issues coming upthen the moment where you are confidentinswitching over to the new system that'sthe third phase where the gcp will beserving the public but your Mainframewill be sitting behind the scene in casejust in case but we won't recommend thisphase to be too long but you will have afreedom of going back if in case theneverything works fine then you willdecommission that you will run then yourgcp will be serving by your businessthat's the brief introduction and let meintroduce Alejandro for his experienceRyanokay so first a little bit of contexthere in Santander we operate in 10 maingeographies we have two core bankingSolutions one for Europe one and NorthAmerica and another one for SouthAmericaand even though these platforms wereresilient they were stable they wereperformant that we were facing some somechallenges challenges because theseplatforms have been built 20 plus yearsago so we were facing challenges aroundtime to Market about efficiency andthat's why back in time a few years agowe started the digital transformation ofour power banking Solutions we wanted tomove from analytic Mainframe basedheavily batched platforms into a newdigitalcloud-based RP event driven platformthere were similar goals that we wantedto achieve with this transformation oneof them was cost reaction of usually wewanted to adopt a new Cloud base if costa piece in platform we want to attainsustainability we are saying that theincreasing transactional volumes theyear and year so that the flexibilitythat a cloud-based platform would giveus would help us in managing this thisadditional volumes while maintaining thehighest standards in terms of resiliencesee availability and securitythat one as I was mentioning before thetime to Market we were having somechallenges in keeping up pace with thechange in our backend systems comparedto what we do in our front-end systemstherefore by the adoption of a New Almstack we were planning to reduce thetime that we required for developing newproducts and services and to reduce thetime for getting that into the marketreal time as I was mentioning theseplatforms were built 20 plus years agothey were built under the paradigms ofthat point in time heavily batched manyof the important things were happeningovernight so we arekind of evolving this uh theseenvironments building event drivenplatforms so that we move into a morereal-time for banking Solutionsapp base some of the challenges that wewere facing as well is was that it wasdifficult to interact with theapplications that we have in theMainframe there was complexity there soin order to abstract that complexity forthe front-end developers we were settingup an IP world that would provide andexpose the products and services that wehave in our core banking Solutions inany standard way which at the same timewill also be a helpful in sense ofreusability so that we can build onesand we can reuse that that newapplication across the differententities within the groupand then lastly data driven rightum access to data in the membrane wasthe kind of cumbersome sometimes so withthis movement what we want to do is tofacilitate the access to that uh to thatdata in order to be able to build abusiness intelligent and so on so one ofthe key elements in order to achieve howthis goes was first one uh moving into amodern cloud-based platformit was a key enabler for all thedifferent things that we are doing inorder to evolve our core packingSolutionsfirst thing we do we did back in timewas to okay let's go to the market let'ssee whichNative or banking Solutions do we havethere that we got news out of the boxhowever we didn't find any that wouldfit all the requirements so the decisionwas taken to less stretchable this corebanking platforms in-houseSecond Challenge that we were facing waswe took that decision is okay how do wedo that how do we convince our estateholders internal Regulators that the newplatform would be up to standards thatthe new platform will be free forpurpose and this is when it came or wecame up with the Dual run solutionwhat is dual run Brian has alreadyexplained it but basically what wewanted to do is that we wanted to testthe new Cloud environment with realproduction data real production volumesand conditions Prior to setting up thisnew environment as the primary one fordoing so we develop a set of tools thatwould allow us to set up the newplatform in cloud and run it in parallelwith the Mainframe with the Mainframeenvironment for that as Brian has beenexplaining we developed a set of toolsthat would allow us first to automatethe compression of the code that we runin the Mainframe so that it could berunning the new runtime in Cloud secondis the the different tools that we useto capture all incoming traffic that wehave in our mainframes to analyze it tothe new environmentand then a set of dashboards that wouldpick up the outcomes from the Mainframefrom the new cloud-based environment andcompare the outputs and show them to toour team so that we could certify bothphonetical and functional perspectivethat the behavior of the new environmentwas similar to the one that we had inthe Mainframe for one we also had a setof tools that would allow us during thestabilization periods of the Dual run tokeep on the data in the briefing and thedata in the cloud environment in syncand lastly a set of tools that allow usto make sure that we do not haveduplicated outputs so that only theprimary environment is the one that isengaging with the with the outside wallof the Mainframeand what we were trying to achieve withthis solution first is to accelerate thetransition to Cloud facilitate thistransition to Cloudas I was saying before this core packingSolutions have been built 20 plus yearsago so using a traditional approach fortesting the new environment would bereally really difficultthat amount of unitary test cases wouldimply a lot of effort across theorganization so that by doing this dualrun it allows us to simplify thatapproach and as well make sure that wecan test 100 the new environmentsecond thingis reducing the transition risks that'srisk management is really key in thiskind of projects so therefore by runningboth environments in parallel we havethe opportunity to fall back to theMainframe at the beginning of the of thetransition in case anything goes wrongand lastly another very important thingthat we wanted to achieve here is now tominimal this reaction to business so aswe're gonna need to engage theinternational teams across all theorganization for that unitary testdevelopment and executionum we would minimize the impact that wehave on ourbook of work as well we we set upmechanisms that allow us to deploy thethe new developments into the Mainframeand deploy them as well in the newcloud-based environment so that we keepthem in sync during the advanced periodso that the book of work the thedevelopments the evolution that istaking place elsewhere in theorganization can continue withoutdisruption while we are doing this dualrun in the move to the cloudnowum we are getting into what we are doingwith gcp the Escapade project what weare doing is our core packing orback-end solution that we use for scavwhich is our Santander corporateInvestment Bank division we are movingthat backend to Google Cloudfrom a functional perspective what do wehave in this environment is theaccounting payments we have applicationsrelated to the market and treasuryrepresents of our Corporation InvestmentBanking division along with severalextrateral systems about customerdatabase and product databasehere we have a few figures that providesome insight in terms of the size of theenvironment that we're talking about wehave around 20 000 core programs 2 900different six transactionsuh we're running on the daily basisaround 7600 jcls in our batch executionsthere are more than a thousand filesbeing transferred outside after thatbatch execution there are more around5500 different DPT tables and in termsof volumes what we have in thisenvironment is plus one million fixedand assessions a day more than 2 millionaccounting operations per day as well interms of transactions onlinetransactions we have peaks of around 150transactions per secondand now moving into how has been ourjourney we started January this year bydeploying The Landing zones and theenvironments and TCP that we will beusing for running these applications atGoogle Cloudit was the first time that we were doingsachana scale project at the GoogleCloud so that the support that wereceive from from your teams were veryhelpful at that point in timeuh once we have set up the newenvironment.cloud we migrated datasoftware and by April approximately wewere already doing the Dual runningpre-production following that dualrunning pre-production we move into theproduction environments productionenvironments were ready around June westarted to our running production aroundearly Julyand now next steps we are planning to dothe final certification during theSeptember month and with the the targetof achieving or setting the new Cloudenvironment as the primary one byOctoberkey figures here we did achieve around99 automation transformation of thesoftware that we had in Mainframe on theadaptation for the new Cloud runtimeenvironment we respected in 30 plus orsavings with this new environment and interms of the timeline we are weexpecting to to complete it within 10monthslastly why Google Cloud well there weremany different reasons why we chooseGoogle I mean technical capabilities orgcp where exactly what we were lookingfor in terms of security resiliencyavailability our Engineers love workingwith gcp support I was mentioning itbefore the support that we have receivedfrom the Google Professional Services interms of Designing these newenvironments have been very good acrossall this journeyum Innovation I mean Google innovationtrack is amazing so that it was theright partner for further evolving thisdual run solution and bringing it to themarket and lastly we also wanted toleverage on the new DCPum region that was set up in in Madridapart from this there were other thingsthat we took into consideration aroundthe data and AI capabilities that Googlecloud has and which will definitely helpus in further evolving further I willwin our Platforms in the futuresecond timeoh sure I meanwe have already completed the theproject that we did in the UK corporatebank that was put into production inSeptember last year then we also did aprogramming in consumer Chileand definitely what we are seeing isthat once the solution was maturedbecause we did the first the firstproject we are still developeddeveloping the solution but now that ithas been developed it has been testedthere is a anoticeable reduction in the time thatwe're required since we start the or wesince we deployed a new environment atCloud I think and we started our run andwe go through the cycle you know the themethodology that we are following we setup the new environment that cloud we dofirst the technical dual run technicalmeaning that we are at that point intime looking into making sure that wehave a complete to our run the technicalstabilization of the environment thatfrom a technical perspective the figuresand the the times that we have in thisenvironment are correct and then we moveinto the certification or functionaldual run in which we involve thebusiness we involve the operations teamsin order to provide them with theevidences that we get from thedashboards that provide then evidencethat the new environment isbehaving effectively the same way thatit was doing in the Mainframe and thetime that we're required to go throughthis process if it's been decreasingonce the the the solution has beenmatured and that and once we havecompleted it in previous countriesright"
