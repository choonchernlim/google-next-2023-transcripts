and uh this is going to be a goodsessionum whether it is you know you have thispenciled in to your agenda when youdownload the app or whether this is theconsolation prize for the mandian eventfilling up I'm glad that you're here andI hope to make good use of your time sowe're gonna have a good conversationabout cyber securityum I will hopefully have enough time forquestions at the end we'll see howquickly we get through it and umdefinitely appreciate any any engagementthat you have uh or questions you haveplease be thinking of them happy toanswer them at the endum so my name is Brent Hamblyum I am the leader of our North Americadetection and response practice so Ihave the privilege of working withclients every day helping them designbuild run their security operations andchoosing the best Solutions and thepartners to do that with I'm reallyhappy today to be talking about ourpartnership with Google it's going to bea wonderful time just by way ofbackground I spent the first 10 years ofmy career in Aerospace and defense solearning for first hand what awell-resourced and a very determinedadversary can do and can make your lifevery miserable learning a lot of lessonsthrough that and helping our helpingsecure clients for that I then spenttime as employee number seven at astartup I was a wonderful Adventure inmy career being able to kind of shareall those lessons that we had learned ina very difficult and uh and environmentto defend in Aerospace and defense andthen I have the approach for the lastfour years of being a part of Accentureand leading our North American detectionand response practice so I'm happy to berepresenting the team here I stand onthe shoulders of a lot of great peoplesome people are here who have helpedbuild the solution and really worktogether on this partnership that wehave with Google soumso we're gonna move fast and cover a lotof groundum I I know our time is going to goquickly if you have one thing that youtake away from the session understandthat Accenture and Google recentlylaunched a new service to be able tosecure our clients it's a managedservice that allows us to provide thatthe Best in Class technology andadvanced security capabilities of Googleand the years and years of deliveryexperience that Accenture has insecurity operations and bring those twothings together and deliver the value toour clients and it's a very adaptablesolution so whatever your environmentyour constraints your budget usually wecan find a way to make that work foryour environment and have you LeverageThe Best of Google's technology andAccenture services but before we getstarted I want to share a little bit ofperspective or maybe just ground us alittle bit in terms of where we're at soif you're looking at this image I hopeit's it's peaceful it's a reliefit could be Friday you know this couldbe you on Friday you're energized fromthe sessions at Google next you came youyou know you have great plans for LaborDay weekend and you you have yourcalendar clear your out of office is setand just before you get out of cellrange you get a call and it's your CIOand they're frantic so this is not agood start to the conversationand they tell you that your company'sCloud environment has been compromisedand the digital platform that helps yougenerate 80 of your revenue is down andas a head of security they need you backat the office as soon as possibleimmediately for as long as it takes torespond and recover from that eventand so obviously this is not a situationthat we never want to find ourselves orour colleagues or a loved one in havingto sacrifice their PTO to go in andhandle a catastrophe in the office Ithink a lot of what we're trying to dowith this partnership between Accentureand Google is help save our clients thepain of that and really help themleverage some of the best practices hereso we're here to talk about thosechallenges the decisions you can maketoday and some of the uh some of therecommendations that we have for you tohave a resilient approach to cybersecurityso you know why are we here uh you knowI think a lot of that question is bakedinto uh the fact that we agree on theprinciples of secure by Design secure bydefault that would be great if that'show everyone operated and that's how allof our Solutions were I think hopefullywe all share an understanding of thebusiness value of cyber security that itis the number one business risk and thatit is a consideration on the minds ofnot only the practitioners in the fieldbut the board of directors rightum but like breaks on a car uh thebetter we secure our assets the fasterour business can move and just to sharea little bit of perspective what itmeans to be like insecurity if that'snot the hat that you wear it's a reallydifficult time for Security leaders andsoas businesses have grown rapidly andwe've recognized the value of digitaltransformation which is undeniable it'sput our Security leaders in a reallytough spot becausein addition to managing all the thingsthat have not been modernized yetthey're also responsible for the thingsthat are being rapidly adopted acrossthe organization and sometimes theyweren't involved in the planning processand sometimes they weren't afforded anybudget to be able to handle that andwhether it's you know securing yourcontainer runtime environment ormanaging the life cycle of a privilegedaccount or mapping your data workflowsacross your SAS applications uh it'sreally tough out there it's a lot tokeep track of as a security leader andit's been particularly rough forSecurity leaders because just as we werekind of gaining traction and momentumand being able to be properly resourcedand get our budget requests fulfilledand get our projects activated thethreat of a global recession basicallyfroze our funding and our hiring soinstead of kicking off those projectsand growing our team as we always hadhopetoun we finally got the support topto bottom for what we're doing we'restuck in a freeze and we're starting toemerge from that but it's been a reallytough time and I think that as securityteams we're always looking for everyadvantage that we can get in thatsituation to be efficient stewards ofour investment so you know to put itsimply we're solving for securemodernization while also dealing withour technical debt or we're Paving theroad ahead of us while we're alsofilling the potholes behindand to put a finer point on it uh andvery relevant to this talk digitaltransformation has been reallydisruptive to security operations sosecurity operations is kind of the heartof the security program that's where therubber meets the road it's where wedetermine are we going to be successfulor not in reducing risk to theEnterprise uh very kinetically and theDilemma that we have is uh we're oftenthe last to find out about changes inthe Enterprise whether it's new assetsand new technologies that we're adoptingbut we alsoum don't you know always have thebusiness context for what these assetsmean and our job in detection andresponse is all about prioritizationthat's the only way we succeed we're notgoing to get to the bottom of the stackwe'll never get to the bottom of theinbox or the queue we really have toprioritize our efforts and so the mostimportant thing that we have is insightinto what matters and what doesn'trelatively speaking and the pace ofdigital change has not made that anyeasierso what are we to do about thiswhen I talk with clients about theirchallenges and we talk about uh whetherit's their budget stagnation or the factthat they can't hire or the fact of thetechnological change in the enterprisewe have a discussion on you know whatwould it take what would it take to seeacross your Enterprisewhat would it take to understand thethreat and accelerate the responsivethreats that we know about in ourenvironment what would it take to beproactive in defending againstadversariesand today I really want to share withyou the solution that Accenture andGoogle have partnered on to be able tohelp you achieve these goalsso simply put this is a breakthroughmoment for detection and response forboth Google and Accentureum we are partnering on the capabilitiesfrom uh from both of our firms to beable to reimagine how securityoperations can be and and really as apartner in security operations how thatcan be an extension of your securityteam within your Enterpriseand also how that can be used to improvenot only not only just deliver theservice that you signed up for butactually improve your securityoperations how are you remediatingvulnerabilities faster how are youreducing risk faster what do youunderstand about the threat environmentwe're bringing those capabilitiestogetherand so this is where I think a lot ofthe important details are this is whereyou'll get the first sense of well whatis he really talking about what is thesolution that Accenture and Google havepartnered with and so we now startpartnership back in April it was RSAright hereum and it was based on a shared visionfor making our clients a more secureoverall and a more secure future forthem but it's also a recognition of theunique value that we both bring to thetable and the synergies that our clientsare going to get out of the partnershipAccenture is the largest SecurityServices firm in the world we're alsothe leader in managed detection andresponse so this is what we do and thisis our specialty one of our manySpecialties across the environmentum and it's we're serving thousands ofclients globally and we've done this forover 25 years and so Accenture mxdr is aplatform that we use to deliver thatservice 24x7 for our clients it's ourpeople it's our platform working aroundthe clock for them never sleeping alwayshaving always being available to themand really being proactive and scalingout what we know about the threatlandscape and being able to apply thatacross our entire client baseand mxdr is now powered by Google'stechnology which is really exciting forus this is a huge turn of the page forus because what Google has done withtheir security business the Acquisitionsthey've made the integration that'shappened between the Acquisitions theway that they're offering that up intheir go to market I hope a lot of youare excited by what you heard in thekeynote about duet Ai and vertex Ai anda lot of the different capabilities thatthey're bringing to the table andcertainly Kevin mandia's talk there's alot of excitement around thosecapabilities and so whether you look atChronicle security operations or youlook at mandan's threat intelligence ofbreach analytics where you look atvirustotal or you look at some of thecapabilities coming in security AIworkbench where some of the foundationalcapabilities we can use to build areally good service in bigquery how dowe search our data at scale and ourdashboards and looker right these arethe capabilities that we're going to bebuilding that we're building thisservice on and offering this to ourclients because it's going to be asuperior solution for them andit really allow us to take a differentapproach to detection and response andreally to bring this all together thisis busy and I know and I'm going tospend a little bit of time on it butthis is really what looks what greatlooks like in manage detection andresponse this is what you hope to hopeto see and feel and experience from aservice provider and transparency andhow they kind of put together theirservice and what what works in thatenvironment so as you move left to rightwe're going from identifying threatactivity to determining a plan of actionto acting on that and we're doing thatthrough Google's technology so we'reusing the chronicle Sim capability toingest all of your security relevantdata bring that all to the Forefront beable to correlate that data against notonly our intelligence but also whatwe're seeing across the broader threatlandscapewe are keeping 12 months of hot datasearchable at sub second intervals soreally fast and responsive times no more10 15 minute queries that run and hangthis is an extremely responsive platformum it's brilliant it works great forwhether you're a service provider likeAccenture or whether you're in thepractitioner chair it's a greatexperienceum and we're also uh exposing thatcapability to our clients so they canhunt at Google speed in theirenvironment they can explore their owndata they can make their own conclusionsand they can collaborate in the servicewith us and that's not true of manymanaged services for those of you whohave delivered that it's not a verycollaborative process so I'm reallyexcited about that in addition we'rereally integrating soar as a fun as afundamental and integral part of how wedeliver our service so soar securityautomate excuse me securityorchestration Automation and responsethat capability has been around for afew years some of you may have haven'tup and running and are loving it withinyour environment some of you may havetried it and didn't find much successwith it and some of you may have yet toexplore it but this capability hasfinally come to maturity and the waythat Google has integrated their Sim andtheir sort capability makes it a valueadd from the perspective of response andthe speed that we can generate from itso not only is it did the products fittogether and work well together we'reactually delivering the service togetheron it we're basing our success on theefficiency of working together with bothof those Solutions so this is the waythat we deliver that service and notonly is it a tool that's going to helpus enrich what we're seeing coming inrespond to threat activities and reallywork with our clients on how we wantthat to flow in their environment butwe're also able to use it for casemanagement so how we actually go throughthe workflow in a sock which having bothof those capabilities together isfantastic and you know for those of youwho have experienced the pain ofmultiple panes of glass and having toswivel seat from one tool to anotherthis makes it extremely simple to beable to understand your environment andso we're really excited about bringingChronicle Sim Chronicle sword togetherand we're also leveraging a lot of theother great capable abilities from uhfrom Google so when we talk aboutmandian threat intelligence having thatincorporated into our platform alongwith Accenture threat intelligence is areally strong capability you're gettingtwo of the world's leading providers ofthreat intelligence in one platform andI think that that's such an importantvalue proposition because when you saythe name mandian out in the field andfor the uninitiated you know there'svery few who don't recognize the valueand if you do recognize it you know it'stop tier you know that's going to be anexceptional capability we're able tobring that together in the platformwe also want to hit on a couple ofpoints here one is that this isn't allyou can ingest all you can consume kindof model and so you're not penalized forlearning more about your environment andingesting more logs that's very excitingif you've ever been have to pay by theterabyte you know that can get veryexpensive very quickly and you knowthere are different kinds of pricingmodels that are that can be applied ourfully managed solution is all you caningest and so it's based on the numberof nodes in your environment as yourenvironment grows you know we will growwith you but you're not penalized forlearning more for ingesting more forunderstanding more security-rich contextabout your environment that's more thatwe can use to help keep you secure wealso have a centralized web portal thatwe're building that's a common you knowway to interface with our service andthere's nothing really revolutionaryabout that other than you're able toconsume our service interact with ouranalyst see your dashboard understandyour environment what are our relativelyhigh risks what do we need to beconcerned about it's a good uh and it'salso based on your persona so you couldhave your CSO login and be able to seeall the relevant dashboards for he orshe you can also have your analyst loginand kind of find out where do we leaveoff in the investigation and what is thefirst thing I need to be doing now sothat web portal is going to be thatsingle source of Truth for thatum maybe the thing that I'm most proudof is an Accenture Security employee wehave a unified Content Library that isboth tailored for industry and it's alsocontributed to actively by hundreds ofprofessionals globally and what thismeans is we have pre-built use casesautomation playbooks reportingdashboards threat hunt data models Etcso these are things that we can scaleimmediately in your environment so ifyou if you know the experience as a newAccenture client would be we understanda little bit about your in environmentwe activate your instance of ChronicleSim and soar and that is a really quitefrankly pretty quick and straightforwardprocess your data stays where it belongsin your own tenant environmentsegregated from all other data but wealso apply all the indicators that we'reextracting so we can better defend youand our other clients but that wholeprocess end to end it can be activatedvery very quickly through this ContentLibrary and when you think about managedsecurity operations for those of you whohave gone really deep into it and youknow it from the inside out youunderstand there's you know fullymanaged Solutions and then there mightbe a one-off you know maybe a client youhave as a client you have a specialenvironment you have specialrequirements so the provider is going tobuild a custom environment for you andwhat that looks like isum maybe your own instance of technologyand then we come as a service provideron top of it a lot of those teamsoperate independently they're really notconnected they're doing the service forthe client and they're not reallyworking together and scaling across thisannouncement with Google and not onlyplatforming our mxdr Solution on Googletechnology it also gave us theopportunity to pull together our GlobalContent Library from across our manydelivery centers globally we have 20Global socks and cyber fusion centerspull all that together and allow us tobring that to bear for clients so that'sreally exciting that's practical valuefor you as a client you're going to getthat immediately from the solutionand to take it one step further I don'tknow if how familiar you are with thearchitecture behind Chronicle maybeyou've tried it you know a few yearsback or you know relatively recently ormaybe you've never seen it beforeum but I think you know the mostimportant thing about Chronicle is thethe speed that we can get the value fromit and it's flexible integration modelso when our clients ask us why Chroniclecertainly we we work with otherproviders and platforms but whyChronicle right we we share a point ofview because of a number of veryspecific capabilities one it's got arich integration ecosystem over 400Integrations are available meaning oddsare in your environment Chronicle isgoing to natively support it if notwe'll build parsers with ChronicleEngineers to be able to support thatenvironment that's one pointyou look at the performance and thescalability of the environment it's hardto argue with the responsiveness of thesearch and how fast it can horizontallyscale we're also looking at the humanfactors how do you interact with theplatform is that a good experience isthat a you know an experience that you'drather not have but you'll live with itright we want our clients to bedelighted by that experience and reallysee that responsivenessum but really above allwith Google's vision for how they'regrowing their security practice andtheir security technologyum the vision that they have on makingtheir clients more secure all theirproducts are security first right wereally have great confidence and theirsolution is going to grow as our needsgrow for our client and working withdirectly with Chronicle Engineers onbuilding the solution out and helpingthat scale to accentuate size we havehundreds of clients globally we do manymany engagements across all of our uhacross all of our delivery centers thisis going to scale with us and so that'sa really exciting part to know withconfidence that as a client you're goingto get a great experience and you'regoing to get a solution that scales umwith your experienceso for um kind of to to put a a littlebit of reality on it right we fullyrecognize that clients have Investmentsthat they've already made and platformsthat they may already be very happy withand so maybe you if you're one of thoseclients you don't see the value innecessarily what we're doing herebecause this is a chronicle-basedsolution you've already chosen what youwant to do or maybe you are one of theclients that has very specificrequirements on what you need to dowhether your data needs to stay in acertain region of the world or you havesome regulatory restrictions on who cantouch the platform and things like thatright there's solutions for each clientand that's what I think one of the keymessages that I want to address iswhether you are more aligned to one ofthe two models and the two models are onthe left it's our full stack modelthat's our platform our people 24x7support globally deliveredbased on the scale we can offer that areally great price point right so that'sthat allows us to achieve the most valuefor clients it's typically what we wantto leave with what we want to lead within our discussions unless there are somedriving requirements that would causeyou to need or want your own platform inwhich case we're happy to work with youon that and that's the solution on theright which is hybrid and you know forthe sake of being at the conference andpresenting this material right you caninsert your own vendor names into theother SIM and soar products but theseare the reality of the environment thatwe're in and we're never going to gointo a client environment and requirethem to replace what they already havethat might be working well for them butwe do want them to benefit from themanaged service that we can deliver forthem and we do want to make this as easyas possible for them so really that kindof middle slice of that soar integrationlayer that is what is really specialabout the service because that is alayer that allows us to bring ourContent Library our service delivery alleverything that we know about the threatlandscape directly to a client withoutthem having to re-architect theirenvironment and so this is anapproachable solution it'sstraightforward to onboard it'sstraightforward to utilize and we canconfigure the solution for our clientsand really work with whatever the techstack is in the environment many clientshave multiple Sims for different reasonsthat's fine right we can use that soreintegration layer to cut across all ofthat I think that that might be avalue-added capability that you eitherhave to build yourself or it's tough tofind in the market because I don't knowtoo many you know of the sourcesolutions that can really do a good jobof centralized security monitoring withmultiple security platforms that youhave to pay attention tosothinking ahead I think I've sharedenough about what the you know theoverall solution is and maybe theflexible ways that we can deliver it Iwant to leave you with hopefully alittle bit of value in terms of whatgood looks like in security operationsand ways that you can advance your sockregardless of your Tech stack rightsowhen we look at what success looks likein security operations all roads pointback to intelligence this is what weunderstand about our own environmentthis is what the experts at Mandy andAccenture and other threat intelligenceproviders tell you about yourenvironment in terms of whether or notyou're secure whether or not you're atrisk but really if you can align onbusiness value and you know from the topdown what are the valuable assets whatare the valuable business processes whatare the aspects of the network that areparticularly sensitive what are our whatare our really sensitive subnet rangeswhen you can understand all of thosethings together you have a goodperspective on the threat landscapebecause you know your business and youunderstand your industry and youunderstand the adversaries thattypically Target your business in yourindustryand you understand the vulnerabilityposture of your organization and all ofthat is able to be integrated into theplatform and you understand through yourown analytics what you're experiencingand seeing on your network today you canbring all that together that's trueleverage intelligence that's appliedintelligenceand when we have the conversation withour clients about what does Intel meanto you and they may have a very prolificanswer to that or they may be strugglingto respond to I don't know that we'vereally figured it out it's a feed thatwe have it when it you know dings we wepay attention but we don't get much moreout of that right whether you knowwhether you're you're in either of thosecampsum where we start with our clients is astructured conversation on helping themunderstand that understand their threatlandscape and so left to right in thebottom of this graphic are really how wehave those conversations and so we takea threat actor and we understand theirway of operating their their tacticstechniques and procedures or ttps weunderstand we help them understand thatright based on their industry based ontheir environment we if they can name anapt group or an adversary that they wantto Target we can tell tell the clientwhat we know about that and help themwork through that what that helps withis prioritizing the content that we haveand prioritizing the rule sets that weconfigure for them again it's all aboutprioritization so if we're building inthe right direction because we'restarting with the right contentfoundation in our seminar Technologiesif we are aligning our capabilities inorder in in terms of our responseprocesses on the right order ofoperation based on the threats that wesee we can be very successful and wehelp our clients stratify on that so weput that in a priority order and finallywe help advise our clients on thebenefit of a threat intelligenceplatform because whether it's Accentureis provided or it's another uh threatand tell platform that's provided in themarket this is really where a lot ofthat comes together and you start makingthis real for your Enterprise and so Ilike to think about it this way rightother organizations may know a lot aboutyou because they are you know scrapingthe internet and they are scraping thedark web and they are dredging up all ofall of that intelligence that's relevantfor your business the one thing theycan't see is inside of your Enterpriseand those are where some of the hardestand most important Lessons Learned areand you have to have a way tomemorialize that within your environmentand so when we think about threatintelligence organic or original threatintelligence is some of the mostvaluable that we have and so we'd adviseyou to certainly collect that use thattell stories about that in yourenvironment I meant talk about whythat's important and why you never wantto experience that kind of incidentagain and what you learn from it butalso if you can share that back with usas a partner we can be more effective inpreventing you from experiencing thatand preventing our other clients fromexperiencing that in a way that protectsyour privacy and we can do when we cando that across our hundreds of clientsglobally that's a really powerful forceand so I'd like to share with you onemore thing which is maybe my favoritemetric in what it means to be successfullong term in detection and responseso for those of you who are familiarwith minor attacker but maybe you're notthis is a 12-step process of decomposingwhat we know about a threat actor'sactivity this is the attack life cyclebroken down into granular Bits And thereason we do this is because we can bemore much more effective at defendingagainst this when we understand thespecific stages of an attack and howthat typically plays outand when you look at the model and whenyou understand left to right left iswe've done a really good job and we'veyou know eliminated risk early on in thecycle or you look right and it's adisaster and you know these are you knowbusiness impactful eventsum you start to think about okay wellobviously how can we get as far left aswe possibly can be and so by gatheringyour data and by organizing your data bywhere where are we detecting this andwhere are we remediating these threatswe can be really effective in telling amessage of are we getting any better I'msure you've all been asked the questionfrom your leadership are we secure andit's an impossible question but you canspin that slightly and say this is howmuch more secure we were from last yearand this is how we do it right we webreak it down into the average time todetect and the average time to remediatewe plot that out and we can show themthe growth over the time this is whatthat looks likeso the y-axis is those 12 steps of themiter attack frameworkand as you see the plot lines whatyou're looking for is a downward Trendand in this case it's a good news storyand this is what we would tend to expectover a year serving a clientand uh that green line at the bottomthat's the Baseline that's what we'reseeking that's our Target that's whatwe're going for this is an organizationset priority but it's really what we'restriving for and so you see the firstchord this is a quarterly plot so thefirst quarter you see we weren't doingvery good we were being heavily impactedby uh the threat activity in ourenvironment these are things that arecausing big impacts to our business andconsequences probably costing us afortune maybe we're having to fileclaims against our in our cyberInsurance maybe we're really having somepainful conversations about LessonsLearned maybe our leadership team looksdifferent I don't know that that's areally bad news story if that's wherewe're starting as a data point and yousee we're not being effective indetecting or responding to any threatsas we move to the second quarter you cansee we've had a significant noticeableImprovement in detectionbut remediation really hasn't moved thatmuch maybe that's because we pooled allof our resources said we're really intough shape let's at least try to findwhere these you know threats aretargeting us and do a really good job upfront at detectionthen but maybe we haven't had enoughtime or energy to devote to having theremediation conversations or we'rehaving trouble building a relationshipwith the people that actually remediatebecause we really need that solidpartnership with infrastructure withendpoints with applications with networkwith all the parts of our business to beeffective in actually responding andremediating and so you know we're we'reslightly improving but we've got a roomto go and then in quarter three we see anoticeable Improvement in remediationmaybe we've been successful innegotiating what good looks like andmaybe enabling sorta do its job and do areally good job in protecting us from uhthe threat activity but our detectionshave actually gotten worse overallbecause maybe we're getting targeted bya different group or maybeum we just didn't have you know theright detections in place for that somaybe the situation looked worse beforeit got better because we just brought anew capability on boardand then finally we can tell a good newsstory in quarter four because not onlyhave we you know brought the detectionand Remediation statistics to the youknow all-time low from our measurementbut we can tell a really good storyabout how much better off we are nowthat we've been on this journey andwhether you're doing this through apartner like Accentureum and and or consuming a service likeAccenture mxdr that's powered by Googleor you're using another solution this isabsolutely something that you shouldconsider tracking because we all have totell the story about how much better arewe this is a really effective wayum and and helping and it's a way tosocialize some of the vernacular that weuse in securitywith our executivesso obviously I'd be remiss if I did notmention generative Ai and how we'releveraging generative AI but I'm happyto say that this is a real capabilitythat we are using to not only scale butalso help improve the quality of ourdelivery very very rapidly and so inaddition to all of the great generativeAI capabilities that we're leveragingbuilding on vertex Ai and and the wholeGoogle ecosystem we are also buildingour own security AI assistant and thisis for our security operators that areserving our clients to be able to bemost effective and efficient in whatthey do and I think some of the toughestchallenges in the field are knowing whatto prioritize being able to act quicklyspending most of our time on value-addedactivities and really being able to beconfident about yes we took the rightaction and we we did that correctly andthat whole closed-loop feedback processfor the analyst and those are some ofthe use cases that we're working on soas you look around the the wheel of thethe use cases that we're working onthose are real things that we'repowering generative Ai and our modelsthat we're utilizing both you knowmodels directly in vertex Ai and our ownmodels that we've trained on securitydata to be able to say this is how ouroperations team is doing and this isgoing to be their assistant to be ableto help them through an investigationand rapidly reduce and if you want tosee a demo of this capability we're inBooth 401 I'd love for you to stop byand see this capability and kind of howour operators are going to be able tointeract with that in November we'relaunching two of the modules here one isthe incident response reporting for ourclient so in other words making sense ofthis and being able to roll this up andcommunicate this clearly to Executivesthat's going to add a lot of value aswell as our ability to translate acrossthe many languages that we have to workwith right when we work with trulyGlobal clients that have operations inall kinds of countries obviously it'sbest to communicate in the primarylanguage that they're they're working inand many times there can be things Lostin Translation it's difficult tocommunicate across environments soimagine logging into the portal andanybody on your team seeing thedashboard in their native language it'sa really powerful capability that quitefrankly not many firms can offerso I wanted to kind of incorporate aquote that I think puts a really nicepoint on what we have to deal with insecurity so Darwin's theory of evolutionuh and is is working in in evolution uhreally helped us understandand an accelerated path life on earthright he helped us explain a lot of whatwe're seeing in life on earth and thehighest the trait that was most highlycorrelated to survivalist species wasthe ability to adapt change that's whatwe have to do every day in Security intechnology in the fields that we're inand that's really hard to keep up withand so that principle really sticks wellwith our industry right the technologiesthat power our businesses and theeconomic factors that Prevail and justhow we interact with each other ourability to adapt to change and move thebusiness that maybe is maybe yourbusiness is acquiring another firm it'sdivesting part of a business maybe it'sgetting a new line of business maybeit's you know moving into a differentgeography as you grow and scale you needa partner that can adapt to that changewith you that is at the core of our uhethos if you will that's that's theheart of what we doand when you're looking at a partner indetection and response and when you'reevaluating all of the different factorsthat go into a decision about selectinga partner I really wanted to be able togive something back to you that I'veexperienced in many of the conversationsthat we have with clients about whyAccenture why your service why thetechnology platform why are you going tobe the right partner for us and I'mhappy to sayum that some of these Lessons Learnedyou know we'd have confidence we'd haveconfident response to all thesequestions but our lessons learned arenot all providers are considered equalright and so as you adapt to changethink about you know conversations withyour provider about can they explain toyou simply and transparently how they'redetecting threats in your environmentcan they tell you what they're going todo with another a new piece of threatdata or an indicator of compromise thatthey see the right answer is we're goingto Retro hunt against all the logs thatwe have for you and we're going to tellyou if we've ever seen that threat inyour environment we're going toproactively protect you from that in thefuture and if you have a sore capabilitywe're going to automatically block thatwe're going to block that IP on thefirewall we're going to you know lockthat user account those kinds of thingsright you need a confident response fromthat on your partnerwhat is the value of intelligence dothey prioritize it is it and also Randdo they have you know capabilitiescoming in from other feeds that they'reable to be used in that environment it'svery important are they aligned to yourindustry do they understand yourbusiness in the industry that youoperate in do they understand thedifference between an oil and gaspipeline versus a medical device in ahospital versus you know e-commerceplatform in the cloud right can theyspeak those languages can theyunderstand where you are at as a clientand really partner deeply with you it'sa very very important decision and thencan they serve your whole Enterprise andmaybe most importantly these days ishow are you going to keep costs downyear to year what are the things thatyou're doing to become more efficientbecause I don't want to see escalatingcosts every year you know your serviceneeds to be getting more efficient andyou need to prove to me how you're goingto do that generated AI is one way to dothat and that's certainly one of themany things that we're doing but thisGlobal model is super important to usfor doing thatso with that cheat sheet in mind youknow I started withhow are you going to approach this orwhat would it take to you know whatwould it take to see across theEnterprise what would it take tounderstand understand the threat andaccelerate a response and to be able toyou know adapt and be able to keep aheadof threat actorsum you know what you need is a greatpartner who has experience in deliveringthe service at scale designing buildingand running not just running butdesigning and building securityoperations that's very important you geta lot of perspective by having to buildthings from the ground up and thenunderstanding the value of managedservice and the integration of thatsuper important we need to be able tounderstand the threat and not onlycontextualize what you're seeing but addvalue to that through the threatintelligence that's being curated allthe way from the Strategic level ofwhat's going on geopolitically what'sgoing on in the threat actor communitieswhat's going on in the dark web forumsbut also very tactical intelligence thatwe can use in your environmenthow can we accelerate response is soar acore part of the strategy or is itsomething that we do because a lot ofclients ask for and we bolt it on and weuse it if clients ask for it but it'sreally kind of something on the sidebecause for us it's a core part of ourstrategy and we need to make sure thatour clients see the value of that theyunderstand that there's a lot offlexibility in how we do that that is aconsultative process of what actionwould you like us to take would you liketo be involved in the response processone of the really interesting thingsthat we can do with Chronicle soar ifyou're not familiar we can put a humanin the loop for specific steps in aPlaybook so that if there is a detectionthat fires on one of your criticalassets and for a end user workstation wewould contain it immediately we don'twant that anywhere near our network butthis is a critical web server this isserving up a critical application thatruns our business what do we do in thatscenario well I want my Securityadministrator or I want my like leadsecurity analyst in the sock our toptier analyst to be able to make sense ofthis and work with our application teamto coordinate maybe the restoration ofservices the takedown or how wereconstitute the service and relaunchthat that new clean instance right so wecan put that human in the loop to beable to take that action and reallyinvolve our clients in the responseprocess that's a really excitingcapability and then finally from theproactive standpoint how are we bringingtogether all of our operations dataright how are we really leveraging thescale that we're operating at if yourprovider serves two you know hundredsand hundreds of clients every year Iwould expect a service that also canleverage the benefits of the hundredsand hundreds of client engagements Iwouldn't want my engagement to only bein its in its separate box without theability to really benefit from that andthat's really what we've tried to buildhere so hopefully you gained somethingfrom this I love you know additionalquestions or anything that you mightwant to shareum really if you're you know we'd loveto you know be challenged on what we'redoing here and seeing you know why youmay you may doubt that this would workin your environment but I really thankyou for the timeum Accenture we're really really excitedabout the mxdr platform powered byGoogle technology a lot of excitingannouncements from Google here encourageyou to do that we have great partnerstotal and really bring all thosecapabilities to bear so thank you verymuch for the time and hope to see youaround and answer your questions maybeit Booth 401 or off to the side herelater thank youforeign"
