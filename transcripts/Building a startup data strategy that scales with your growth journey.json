    "transcript": "hello everyone welcome to this sessionI'm very excited to be here today I'msure Monir from tradish our customers aswell is going to be joining us on thestage really soonI lead the customer engineering teamthat engages with startups at GoogleCloudand I would say that my team and I wehave one of the best jobs at Googleat least I think so and I say thisbecause we get to engage with you thestartups on a daily basis we get to seewhat's the latest and greatest thatyou're putting out there all theInnovation you're being bringing to theworldnow it's a big privilege and a bigresponsibilityat the same timewe want not just want to help youunderstand our technology but we want tohelp you achieve your goalsand there's one particular goal that isthe major major driving force for yourtechnology decisionswhich is survivalit's very easy to get lost in thetechnical detailsbut we know that when you're choosingtechnologyit's about what's going to give you themost Runway and the most longevity for acompanymany of you say that the feeling isalmost like you're this small fish inthis fast open oceanfull of sharks and you're trying tothrive in this challenging environmentI really like the ocean analogy herebecause it can give can teach us someinteresting principles about data andstartups but before I do that I actuallyneed to give credit to my kidsthey love the ocean they love the animalworld my little onea few weeks ago came to me true storyand said Daddy did you know that 90 ofthe ocean hasn't yet been exploredand did you know that for you to see themostamazing and interesting things in theocean you have to go really really deepbut you cannot see with your human eyesyou have to use special technology youhave to use special helpobviously I found that reallyinteresting I learned a lesson there butit's so true about data we all know thatthe majority of the data out there stillunstructured yet to be exploredand we know that even as a startup ifyou want to get truly the most value outof their data your data you have toreally really go deepand you can't do it on your own you needto rely on special technology andspecial helpnow for you as a startupyou're focused on short term you're insurvival modeyou truly want to push your products outthere as fast as you can so you can findproduct Market fit and findprofitabilityso you're not thinking too forward so adata strategy for you might not be yourimmediate priority right nowbut if you want to be aroundin the next few years where AIwill shape your futureit's likely that you have to invest on adata strategy because it's going to bekey for your long-term survivalwe understand that the challenge here isto make it a reality to startups to makeit a reality for youthe common guidance that you get whenyou're shaping a data strategy is thatyou're gonna have to do a lot of thingsat once very complex starting with alignyour strategy with your company goalsand then invest in complex governanceand a technology stackhoweverthe reality is you might not even knowwhat your goals are because you're insurvival modeyou might be limited on finances or youdon't have enough data you might thinkand limit it as a teamwhen you think about gen Ai and thefuture of large language models the goodnews is this is going to allow you tohave to turn less knobs for your dataand it's going to help you close the gapand catch upto the bigger playersbut at the same time if you truly wantto uncover the most insightful thingsout of these intelligent models youpotentially have to tune in fine tunethese to your own industry and domainspecific needssothe future is going to be less about theknobs to turnbut way more about the questions you'regoing to answer to you're going to askyour data and that quality of answersthat you want to get of them and forthat you truly need a solid foundationaldata modelso how do you build a data strategy as astartup regard regardless where you arein your growth Journeytoday I want to propose 10 stepsfor you to go from this small to thisbig fish on this data ocean from thesurface level all the way to the deepestone so you can find those very mostinteresting insightful things that myson once shared with methis journey is an incremental if youare a data company today you sell dataas a product or serviceit's very likely that you might be onstep 10.however you might need to cover someground and go backwards on these stepson this journey to cover somefoundational thingsfor the majority of you if you'refollowing these steps just know that youcan start at any point if you feel thatyou're swimming against the currentcontinueI have confidence that you're gonna getsome momentum and at some point you'rereally gonna reach those deep levels andyou're going to be able to be recognizedas a data driven companyso let's get startedokay step number one regardless if yourecognize yourself as a small or a largefish in this oceanyou don't have to manage infrastructurefor your data needsthere's a lot that goes into managingdataGoogle cloud has industry standard openprotocols developer friendly data storesand databases solutions that had out ofthe box features so you don't have tospend time managing these thingsso then your team can focus on the mostin parts and places which is within yourbusinessandwith your customerssecondas you swim in this open data ocean youdon't want to go from C to C with yourdataas much as your architecture allows youwant to keep your data stores in thecenter as close as possible to your dataapplicationsin your applications in general and yourdata services the services that willtransform and process your dataand I'm saying this not because we don'twant to encourage you in the future tobe in a multi-cloud on a in amulti-environmentit's because for now this journey is allabout taking incremental stepsand you want to reduce the variables youhave to manageGoogle cloud is the most completeand unify data and AI solution providerand it has everything that you need fromstart to finish from ingestion toprocessing analysis and intelligenceand you have everything in one placeokay now you're navigating this oceanyou're like I need to find answers indirection and you might wonder as astartup I don't have enough data am Ifeeling this Advantage with other bigfishes out therebut I would challenge the fact that ifyou look within the confines of yourstartup todaythere's plenty of data that might bevaluable to you to get started withpayment System Authentication systemsyour user and website analytics all ofthese they have key insights that youcan draw fromas you look through other sources ofdata searches third-party dataaccessible open data sets Public apisPartnerships that you can do with otherstartups you'll be able to not justenrich your first party data sources butalso to find correlations that you candraw from to start taking actionsand lastly there is the case for usingAI to not just augment your data setsbut also to compensate for potentialbiases and one of the most interestingthings with AI is going to help you turnless knobs so you can prepare those datasets that data Foundation cleaningpreparing for further analysisnow you need to find a data at home forthis datain our ocean analogy here I will call ita data Reefin the beginning the data that we talkedabout is very likely that we'll be inyour transactional databases which isfine but as you aggregate more dataincluding unstructured datait's very likely that you're gonna haveto invest on a solution such as bigquerywhich is our fully scalable serviceserverless data warehouse one of themost loved startups must love productsby startupsthis is not just going to allow you toset a foundation for your data down theline but to be the source of Truth foreverything that you're building in yourdata strategy and even set the futurefor for AI insights that you want todraw fromas you do thisthen navigating this vast ocean youmight find stormy waters some predatorsso you want to take advantage of thesecurity measurements and small stepsthat you need to take in order toprotect this data and even meetcompliance requirements if you'reoperating on a highly regulated industryI'm not using the word governance herebecause I know it's a scary word for youas a startupit's small steps fromgiving the right access to the rightpeople to the right dataor even protecting your users datathere are several ways you can getstarted within Google Cloud's consoleyou can adjust settings to give theright access and permission you can useapis such as data loss prevention API toanonymize or protect your users data andeven use tools like you can seesecurity Command Center which is part ofour security portfolioto scan your environment scan your dataallow you to see data vulnerabilitiessensitivity and compliance requirementsthat need to be metI have good news for you you're goingfrom surface level now on this water todeeper levels the current is in yourfavor and this is one of my favoritesteps of this journeyit's when you are going to expose yourdata to as many people as you can withinyour company and outsidetwo ways I want to recommend for you toget started number one investing lookerstudio just can get started at no chargeyou're gonna Expose and Report thesource of truth of your companywith your most important and key metricsfrom your sales pipeline your marketingcampaigns your operations in general andeven the cost of your data strategy hereas you do this and you build thismeaningful and beautiful dashboards it'svery key that you provide them thechance for your teams to start lookingfor answers on their ownallowing them to do ad hoc analysis theeasiest way you can do this it's usingconnected sheets you're going to connectGoogle Sheets to bigquery as a datasource and you allow people to queryfresh data using familiar skills thatthey have using Google Sheets such aspivot tables and dashboardsbut here's the important part of thisstepnot they just are looking for answersbut they're going to start understandingeach other's business internally even ifyou have a small team of co-foundersyou're going to be able to startchallenging and holding each otheraccount because now you're uncoveringkey data points and the most importantpiece is you now truly uncovering yourkey performance indicators your kpis sonow you can align your data strategyfinally to your company goalswhich is the next step once you identifythose key performance indicators yourkpis you're going to set targets forthemall these metrics here you're veryfamiliar with them since day oneand obviously they're just examplebut the most the key factor is here isthat because you expose the data to yourteams they now they have the historicalsthey have the Trends they understandexactly which kpis you need to optimizefor it so you're gonna set Targets onthem and as you hit or increase orincrease increase the targets that youset yourself for you can now startcalculating the ROI for your datastrategy the return on investment yourdata strategyand then you can start reporting that toyour stakeholders to your investors toyour customersso now you're ready to go to deep Watersthe first time you're going toexperience those intelligent insightsdrawn from artificial intelligence andfrom machine learning I know you havemany ideas from the announcements thatyou heard this weekend next but onequick way for you to start get for youto get started drawing those intelligentinsights it's within bigquery usingbigquery ml you can createtrain deploy machine learning modelsacross forecasting classification andmany others so now you can startuncovering in sites such as whichcustomer is more likely to buy yourproduct or which customer is more likelyto churnand as you experience this you want tobe doing this continuously because itmakes all the difference for yourstartupbefore you try to do this and put thison a loopit's very important that your teams theyadoptall the steps that we've been talking intheir daily operations it needs to bepart of their cultureso next you're gonna ensure they'reinstilling this within your company butlike any culture change it requiresintentional effort starts from theleadership starts from the sea leveldownand it's going to be a continuous effortby the waythere are a few ways that you canapproach internally from the moment thatyou're hiring people and you're askinginterview questions you need to assesstheir data skillsthe moment you're assessing theirperformance or whenever you're making orapproving decisions about your productsor any other Innovation decisions youhave to push back on the people in theircompany that they're providing dataanalysis data backed and justifiabledecisionsso they understand that if they want toperform well they have to be data drivenpeople it's not about slowing down yourstartup it's about your peopleunderstanding that they have to be datadriven in order to succeed in yourcompanyexternallyin a similar way first thing you'regoing to clarify to your customers thatthey have control over the data theirdata that they have privacybut you have to continuously exposemetrics to them so they understand thatyou're making decisions about product orthe way that even your Market orinteract with them and prioritize themis based on dataas you do this one of the key ways thatyou're going to identify you'resucceeding in is when your customersreach out to you referencing a datapoint that came from a customerengagement or from a publication thatyou had out therenow you're not just going from aonead hoc cycle of your data strategy butnow you're truly embedding this in thebackbone of your companies almost partnow of your DNA and you're beingperceived externally as a data-drivencompanyso then I can officially say that you'reready for the last step of this journeywhere you're going to continuedefinitely and completely change thegame on the way youaround or your data strategy which isinvesting in business Advanced businessintelligence and artificial intelligenceonce more you probably have many ideasas a homework going back to your to yourstartup that you want to apply from allthe latest generative Ai andannouncements that you have but thereare a few suggestions that I want toprovide today so you can get startednumber oneinvesting in our licensed version oflookerlook we're not just gonna change the wayyou do data modeling and governancebut we'll give you a chance to Now puton autopilotactions based on triggerson data anomalies and changes so it canbe on top of your customers journey andon top of your product changessecond you're not just going to bebuilding meaningful and beautiful dataviews with looker but it's also going toallow you to embed those views withinyour customers tenant environment so nowyou can start charging money for thoseinsights that

your company and lastly thisis an incremental Journeyand you can find cost efficient ways todo it as you grow in Google Cloud willbe close to you along the way to supportyouthank you very much[Applause]now I'm happy to invite Moneer to thestage one yearis this lead software engineer fortradish one of our customersand he's going to be talking about howthey took an approach using their datastrategy to achieve their business goalsfor the introductionbut welcome everyone hope having a goodtime here with us I doum all right let's get startedso I want to follow through on like thissurvival idea for startups that Filippotalked aboutand I've been working startups for mostof my careers and careers career onlyone uh and so far every time wasjungling between trying to buildfeatures to Resource Market fit orbuilding futures for investors and likebe able to survive it to the next roundso we can raise money and continue otherJourneys or startups and what I'm heretoday for is to share my experience attradish on how implementing likeum Filippo's journey is helping us notonly survive until the next round butit's helping us building a company thatisprofitable or about to become profitablevery very soonokay funny clicker uh okay so who we areat tradex so tradish is a company thatis building software for small foodoperators in entrepreneurs that and wewant them to be profitable from day oneright and that is extremely important asthe company we're very small fish in theocean we're only 10 employees and theentire company is only focused on onething making our Merchants profitableevery decision we make has to be tied tothat one goal for the company and ifthey are profitable we are profitablebecause the way we make money is bytaking a small cut other transactionsso how do we do that the first thing weneed to do here is like interestunderstand as engineers and Builders andproduct managers understand the businessstrategy that isum here to that the people want toexecute on right so how does businesspeople like Envision the strategy of thecompany to able to achieve that for usat tradish it's been with three pointsthe first one is like every singlestartup we need to have users right sowe want to generate adoption in ourproduct using influencers and we'll seelater what influencers mean for usthe second step for us is to detecthotspot among those people that areusing our products right and once wehave those hot spots of likeentrepreneurs that are actually makingbusiness within our platform what youwant to do is like invest in them sothey can make even more profit with ourplatform and with that we do make profittooso now that we understand the businessuh strategy what do we need to do isexecute on that one so we're going tosee how to really do that strategy orhow we build that strategy at tradish tomake that to enableum that strategy for our businessso when you talk to the first thing todo is talk to your teams and on our casehere for the first step is like becauseour customer success team which is thesame as our marketing team we're verysmall again uh and we want to understandhow they operate on a digital basis whatkind of data do they need like who theywere talking toand we realized that by doing so theyneed to look at only two data which ishow many Merchants have signed up andalso how far along they are in designerprocess how many products do they havein their catalog rightso we want to focus on delivering thatto these customer success teams thefirst thing we want to do here iswhenever user monolith microservicesdoesn't it doesn't matter for us uhdoesn't matter at all for us we're usinglike commands but it could be anythingwe want it to be deployed on cloud runso that's what we've been doingeverything we're here today is like atrue story it's our storyso this way we don't have to focus oninfrastructure whatsoever we know thatit's going to be here it's going toscale with the con with the company andwe don't have to worry about that at allthat's the first pointonce we have this data it needs to leavesomewhere right so what we've been doingis like putting this data into Cloudspanner and for those who don't knowCloud spanner is an amazing databaseit's been critical for usthis database that can scale literallyinfinitelyallowing strong consistency and stillbeing highly availableso we know that wethere is no problem for us whatever manyusers we have we know that we can counton the database to work with usonce we're there the first step is toput the data somewhere right as Philippasaid earlier what you want to do is likeseparate analytical data fromtraditional data so we push the data tobigquery in there so we can transform itfor our teams to be able to access itso here which the number six points wecan see we can skip stats here that'sokay like we didn't go through theentire Journey properly and that's veryfineand so now what we have is like we havea dashboard from the data coming fromour own product where this customersuccess team is able to see Merchantsignups in real time the merchantsaction that happening and how far alongthey are in the process and are able todo their job using our data right andfor that we're using lookerso now that we haveadoption or product and then the teamthat is handling this part knows how tobring people in and who they are we needour sales team to detect uh thoseentrepreneurs that we want to invest inso we need to talk to the sales teamright so we're adding a new Serviceshere in our monolith still running inCloud run for usand when we talk to them that we want tounderstand how they operate too that'svery importantand so for them there is three thingsthat do matterorder placed product annotated andbuyers signed up because we want to knowobviously how many orders happen do youwant to know the diversity of theirproducts we have so they know howexactly what kind of offering they canmakeand they want to know the demography ofthe buyers like where it's worth toinvest in the future for where we don'thave that many chefs investedso for that point number three we'readding more data into this data setright so we're looking at like publicdata sets for census for example in theUS or we're looking at websites to tryto get like grocery pricing in differentareas to understand where how much mergelike how much we should spend to dogroceriesbecause everywhere we can like help themincrease their revenue we do increasethe revenue as wellonce we do that it goes to look at twoas well and then now we have a brand newdashboard for a sales team to use everyday that allow them to understand theirmargin per Merchants through productdiversity per merchants and also havinga census heat map where they knowexactly where they want to invest theirnest hotspotum and then create a new onefrom there what we have like now we havea true data Core Trainer companyto the point where even our content nowis using Luca to see how much taxes theyhave to pay to differentumuh provinces in Canada or states in theUSso now everyone is using looker relyingon our own data or product dataso we know where the demand comes fromso what we want to do is invest intothose demands right again we have peoplethey make money we want to we want themto make more money so we make more moneyso to do that now it's pretty easy youtalk to a sales team again and the thetheir job is to try to make deals createnew demand for those chefs so like theycan naturally increase their revenuestreambut those seems they want to know ifthey do a good job right so what theywant to know here is like understandthe difference between the auto placedthe irregular order placed and the autoplace through the elevated channel thatwe provided to them so we monitor thatas well and add that to our dashboardand so now this sales team has like anew kpi that they can rely on and canset Targets on this kPa as well tounderstandthe animated margin per Merchant so theyknow that if their actionhave actually good consequences forchefs and for the company too and adjustin case we need toin doing all of that allowed Us in liketwo yearsto release a brand new product we justgo like tradition Group which allow ustoprovide for a very fraction of the pricelike to our chefs to to oh do groceriesrightand being able to increase their marginin a world where like doing cross racingoperating your business Food business issuper expensiveyeahso the takeawayswhat I want you to remember on thisstock is one thing this is the first onethis is the most important you likeenable and Empower your businessoperations not just your customers yourproduct is Has Two Faces your operationsyour customers not one if you're doingone you're doing half the jobsecond point is input operations intoyour engineering meetings and productmeetings after all your startup you'rethe same team there is no silos in therethat's very importantand lastly Google products are amazingbut can be a little bit expensivesometimes so you should leverage Googlefor startups Cloud program we did thatand it allowed us to have access to bothspanner and looker without those toolswould have wouldn't be like where we areright nowthank you very muchthank you"
