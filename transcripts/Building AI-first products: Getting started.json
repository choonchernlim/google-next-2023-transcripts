    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thanks for comingum my name is Ben Royce I'll bemonitoring today's panel I'd like forpanels to come and join me if you canand we will start with sometough questions around Ai and buildingAI first products because we come upall rightso joining us today we have aquite the list of Heavy Hitters I wouldsayum joining us from Google here for myfrom your right to left uh Barack our GMof cloud AI at Google Google Cloudspecifically we have Marty brodberg ourCTO of Priceline and in the middle herewe have Vish anantramon from the MayoClinic CTO so thank you guys for joiningus I appreciate itso I think it's actually kind ofI want to make this as conversational aspossible because I think you get the themost value you get the mostunderstanding and the most directnesswhen you keep it I'd say informal but uma couple things I want to cover today isa little bit around AI building FirstData and then I want to spend quite abit of time on generative AI which isthe is the word du jour or the phrase dujour I would sayum so with that I'll start uh ask acouple questions building AI firstproductsummany of our customers Cloud customersask us the best way to get involved withAI and you've heard it you're talkingabout it doing it a little different alittle harder than just talking about itright how do you suggest they getstarted and what do they choose fortheir first use case uh I'll look atmaybe Vish maybe we'll start thatyeah I mean you know I thinkthere are plenty of use cases and MayoClinic as a health system we haveadministrative use cases we haveclinical use cases we have operationaluse cases and uh you know the best wayinitially to get started is tounderstand where your data is mostaccessible because it's almost you youcan have a lot of problems to solve andyou can solve many areas but if we startto identify where the areas that youhave data easily accessible and we spenda lot of time initially to try over thelast several years in our partnershipwith Google to bring data together in ina place that is easily usable for AIbecause we what we learned is you can doa lot of smaller models and you canbuild a lot of areas which maypotentially have very high value but ifyou cannot operationalize that you can'tsee the value of that AI very veryquickly so I would say think about areaswhere your data is much more easilyaccessible by applying a model canprovide operational benefits in areasonably quick time so friends is ifyou have a data set that takes you knowit can only be brought in every nightbut your operational decision making hasto be done in an hourly basis thenyou're trying to figure out how youbuild this great model but you don'tknow how to operationalize it whenyou're in healthcare so I meanoperationalization is I mean it could bein an operation literally right in thatcase how do you reduce the timeto value in that price in that placeyeah I mean you know I think um uhHealthcare has obviously got a lot ofdata that is streaming data from fromdevices from our electronic healthrecords from our lab systems from ourRadiology system with imaging systemsand so on traditionally it has been verydifficult to build models on streamingdata and uh so what we we would buildmodels that uh you know let's give you apragmatic example you want to predict ifthis patient who's in the hospital isgetting disjudged in the next day or twoit's called predicting the length ofstay of how long the patient's in thehospital because every additional dayfor a hospital most hospitals in theUnited States cost about four to fivethousand dollars for the hospitalbecause they are paid for the wholeepisode in general not for the number ofdays not like a hotel right and veryoften predicting that was seen as veryvery valuable but then as we startbuilding those models it became clear tohave that model be operational you haveto have the data be refreshed every twohours every three hours and traditionalsystems were built to do data analyticson overnight data and so to get valuewhat we started to do was to bring thisdata into more real-time streams and andmake it accessible in a single pane ofglass and we use bigquery for everythingnow you have data streaming intobigquery and you have data models thatwere trained on bigquery but can also beexecuted on bigqueryinterestingum what was your first foray into AI itwas the first AI use case and this isfor all of youuh we I mean we've we've looked atumwhat use cases are going to have thebiggest impact on uh our customerexperience and so you know we we havethis vision of providing reallypersonalized and tailored travelproducts based on real-time signals thatwe're getting from customers so welooked at from a generative AI use caseperspective the parts or sets offeatures that we're going to providethat personalized experience for our ourcustomers so we looked at anything frompersonalized hotel reviews based on thetype of customer coming into ourplatform to providing neighborhooddescriptions based on the hotels thatthey would be visiting and the type ofcustomer it was whether it's a singletraveler or a family of four so wereally honed in on use cases that we'regoing to provide a much morepersonalized enriched user experienceand a lot of what made those use casesimpactful is that we had a very richreal-time data infrastructure built outalready so in enabling those use caseswas much easier because we had acustomer data platform running inbigquery we were getting real-timesignals from our e-commerce platform viaKafka being processed in the data procso so for us again we we tried to focuson where generative Ai and AI was goingto have the biggest impact for ourcustomers so even you would personalizelike a neighborhood description based onsomeone who correct 25 years old lovesnightlife a great example is a uhsomething as simple as a hoteldescription could have multiple meaningsto a person based on how they'retraveling and when they're traveling andthe size of the party that's travelingwith them so gender of AI gives us theability to personalize every fine detailof the the product page for us in a waythat can resonate with this with theconsumer based on their experience andhow they want to travel for thatparticular trip yeahBarack what was what was your firstforeignthis is also almost 30 years ago myfirst experience with AI was essentiallydoing quality deduction for principalcircuit circuit boards like tcps orthese are the boards that you've seenexactly semiconductor yes yes nowthey're nowadays they're like very smallat the time it was like big yeahum so we've come along a lot on that aswell and then shortly after doing uhvarious shape modeling using AI foractually detecting various types ofcancers from computer tomography imageslike colon cancer liver cancer Etc and Ithink one thing that was common at thetime is you would design your AIvery specific to your you know whateveryou're trying to to buildum from all the way the exact design ofthe algorithms the training set Etc it'salmost start from scratch every singletime and I think with generative AIthat's probably the biggest change thatwe're that we're seeing because lots ofAI tasks you can actually start withalmost no data I would say it's it'sit's it's so such a breakthrough andit's so nice to see this this transformwe see so many use cases in healthcarespecifically just it seems to be becausesome of the devices are relativelystandardized like imagery for exampleand Radiology which is makes it actuallymore more accurate which tell us aboutthe AI Factory I mean you have multiplemodels that work at the Mayo Clinic yeahno I mean so samio is obviously providesa lot of complex healthcare for manyAdvanced conditions and the patientsthat we typically get are extremelycomplex patients and we have a ton ofdata uh accessible for these patientswe're also an academic Medical Centerand you know we we have about we spendabout a billion dollars in extramuralresearch through the NIH and otherplaces so we have about you know ourchallenge was uh from a technologyperspective to provide tooling and dataaccessible to thousands of researchersit's not one or two right but literallythousands in a secure way in a privacyprotecting way in many cases because wewe are dealing with a patientidentifiable data and to be able to alsoprovide some of the best and latestgreatest tools available uh you know andand because they are by by Natureresearchers who want to publish as wellat the same time patient safety and andmake this accessibility critical so whatwe did was we we branded some we tookthe vertex AI platform but started tobuild our own customization layersaround it from a data securityperspective from from how do we make itreally simple and easy for a user to beable to connect the data in our big lakeand so for instance I you know one of uhwe Admiral Clinic have about 30petabytes of Imaging data in the GoogleCloud we use an industry sound formatcalled dicom but most of the AI researchor AI models are built you can't usedicom out of the box and you have to usevarious libraries to process the diagraminto JPEG files and other formats thatmake it much more easier for the for thetensors to work and so we built allthese playbooks and that's what we callas AI Factory which allows us to connectto this data reasonably simple way so aresearcher can spend more time in doingAI work than the data engineering workfor example and and so we've also builtsomething called the longitudinalpatient record which brings in data fromacross all of our modalities whetherit's genomic data whether it'sstructured data unstructured data andimaging data and said well you canaccess all of this in a single pane ofglass using the Google tools like westarted off with the user managednotebooks about three years ago and thenwe heard from customers that you knowsometimes controlling costs but theseare difficult so we standardized most ofit to say your happy path is going to beusing a managed notebook I'm veryexcited about collab Enterprise now butmanaged notebook meant that they couldjust use it when they want it'll shutdown when they want didn't want it andsuddenly we saw a lot more adoption sowe've taken this approach of aproduct-centric mindset to taking thetooling that's available the data setsthat are available and offering some uhsome nice uh Pathways for ourresearchers that's great I mean inhealthcare the stakes are high I thinkin travel and bookings it's incrediblycompetitive like Excellence is kind ofbeen the bare minimum I'd probably yeahis that fair to sayumI love talking about use cases because Ithink you know the technology is coolbut how it gets used so I'm alwaysfascinated by it what are some of thebest AI use cases and I love learningfrom this what are some of the worst AIuse cases yeah so some of the some ofthe what I would say the the coolest uhuse cases are really around from ourperspective buildingum and end-to-end customer Journey orwhat we call the connected trip for ourconsumers and it's really takingum our product like a hotel andconnecting the user fromthe the ability to to search to priceand to book a product on our platform sofor instance when you go on to ourproduct Details page you get five or sixcapabilities that will be powered bygenerative AI whether it's thepersonalized hotel reviews thepersonalized neighborhood descriptionsuh the back end checkout process that werunum through our our sets of capabilitiesbut under underneath all that is reallythe capabilities to use Lang chain tochain together these differentgenerative AI capabilities from uh thethe hotel product to the review of thatproduct to the description of thatproduct and rather than all of thatcontent being static it gets updated inreal time based on what's happening inthe world and then the power of takingLang chain you're able to connect yourgenerative AI models with authoritativesources of data like Google Maps or theplaces API to create an ecosystem wherethe product is completely tailored basedon the user logging in and the signalsthat you get from that user I mean thatmakes sense everyone talks about aproperty like a hotel but everyone hasdifferent experiences by definitionright a hotel is a multi-fast yeah thatum depending on who you are and whyyou're traveling you can you can Surfacedifferent facets of of that hotel thatwill appeal to that individual user thanjust saying well this is the Saint RegisHotel or the Hampton Inn you can reallytailor and personalize all the contentaround that property based on the userI want to I want them ranked by highWi-Fi speed however I want to break myWi-Fi it's like might be able to do thatyeah really amazingum yeah that makes my I can I will putup with the worst hotel if the Wi-Fi isamazinguh cool all right let's move on allright dude best and worst use caseum we're hearing lots of use cases rightnow I think all the customers are tryingdifferent use cases some are tryingclassification some uh some sort ofgeneration uh you you use case some ofthem summarization lots of chat andconversation use cases searches at thecore of almost all of these use cases aswell and I think uh you know maybe theharder part of the question is what whatis to avoid I think at Google we arepaying a lot of attention to ethical AIresponsible AI all the safety filterssafety scoresand we're particularly careful about anyAI application that could create a biasas well and I think we're trying toeducateboth internally ourselves as well asexternal the world as well on some ofthese use cases and applications and Ithink when it comes to generative AIlots of safetyscores for for different attributes arebeing provided as well so that you canyou can design your final applicationusing those safety scores as well I sawa fun use case where it takes a largelanguage model to analyze the questionbeing asked of a large language model tosee if it was even appropriate you knowfor work or in the Enterprise orwhatever which is kind of fun so we'reseeing AI for AI but you know I wasgoing to say that you know I think youcould ask this question six months ago Iwould have rattled out a whole set ofthings what you shouldn't use AI forright right and particularly analyticsuse case but really more analytic usecases and so on regular Expressions cando a great jobbut I think uh you know we think of uhgenerally I really is a Prometheanmoment right and um I'm not the firstperson to say that I'm not going to bethe last person to say right uh and umand that's changed the game in terms ofwhat you think about Ai and I I startedmy journey in AI Building rule-basedSystems for uh sub-Saharan Africahealthcare workers they're trying toprovide them wh guidelines it was arules-based system and that was AI yeahright and um now you have as someonesaid from 10 million programmers you'vehad now anybody that speaks a languagebecomes an AI programmer and if you canif you can make that generative AItechnology affordable and safe free ofbiases I think the the kinds of usecases there's no more going to be I'mhopeful in the next couple of yearsyou're not going to ask that questionever ever again yeah yeah I think thethe biggest misnomer though isgenerative AI software development is nodifferent than traditional softwaredevelopment in the sense that it takes avery iterative and a b testing approachto get the optimal results so people askme a lot of time so you've developed youknow generate AI you put it intoproduction what what's next is it'scontinuous and constant iteration andtesting because the biggest thing thatwe've seen anyway is user intent issomething that's a learned behavior overtime yes and the only way that it getsbetter is by the consumption of more andmore training and learning data so thatmeans more consumers interacting withthat feature and learning the intent ofconsumers so for for us it it in certaincases it could take us 25 iterations ofa generate AI feature to put it intoproduction and that's just constant a btesting in order to get to 100 of ofcustomer traffic so I've had to remindpeople that they're called Developersfor a reason because it develops it'snot one and done right that's actuallywith it yeah the two approaches rightone is we call Big Ai and the other issmall AI to some extent right the bigAIS are you know we're going to diagnosesomething are you going to but you needa high level of specificity andsensitivity and you need to really beaccurate may even go into FDA approvalcycles and so on and then there's smallAI which is you know can I automate thefront desk in the doctor's office wherethe tolerance for error may be muchlower but we try to use some existingout of the box Solutions whether it'sfrom Menders or others but we want tobring AI in many places and it doesn'talways it's not always just you need tobe 100 because you may not get hundredpercentall right let's let's talk about thetraining data because a lot of thesuccess of these things depends on thedata that goes in I think we mentionedfor example foundational models bring alot of the data up front when you needsomething let's say non-generative AIwhat do you look for in a training setwhat do you what what are potholes whatare things you'd love to see what'swhat's the golden ticket when it comesto because data is a big small wordmeans a lot rightso training data for for us particularlywith these features is real-time eventdata that we're getting from consumersor customers and we store thatinformation in a series of logs thatthen our product teams and Engineeringteams iterate on in the next Sprintcycle so for us for a lot of thefeatures and functions that we'rebuilding gender of AI for because theyare customer facingum the training data is really the liveinformation that we're getting throughcustomers and their interaction with thefeatures and functions of the productthe other thing is the the signalingdatafor us particularly because we're aconsumer-based platform is really builtupon a customer data platform where westore all the search pricing andcheckout information that our consumersare doing on our platform and thatbecomes another really good training setof data in terms of how we personalizeour products and the feedback that wegetthat's great I could mention one thingabout I'm gonna have tied to generativeAI as well we see lots of customers whoactually have data and maybe lots of itbut one of the challenges that it mightneed to be labeledand they might have only limitedcapacity in terms of board expertise andthen just being able to reach to humanshuman experts to be able to label them Ithink one Trend that we will continue tosee is thatlots of customers will actually end upusing generative or larger models whichare so much better in general inreasoning like the larger the model muchbetter in reasoning to actually be ableto label some of that data maybe atleast as candidates to human expertsbecause they're just not enough humanexperts in the world to be able to labelall the all the data out there and Ithink genetic AI will help with that aswell yeah cat and dog we can do that butyou say hey is this uh like I've seenlabels on some data where it's um youhave to explain the emotional thing oryou have to explain the situation andit's like that is not easily donewithout explicit experts being like thatis you know that is a presentationversus that as a speech versus that as ameeting and you would be surprised evenfor labeling cat and dog kind ofexamples that there are just not enoughpeople in the world to do it or or thatwill be excited enough to do like thosetests as wellI actually had removed customers arehaving challengesI had a guy in a meeting once he um mycat has is like brown with black stripesand a guy walked behind the camera andthis guy goes Ben there's a raccoonbehind you I was likethat's a that's my catyou know so humans get it wrong tooumcool uh let's talk about new featuresyou got a model you've trained at youryournarrow use case is working well rightyou want to add new features you want toadd new parts to it how do you roll itout I imagine in healthcare this iscarefully done I hope yeah I mean Ithink uh you know we have um when wethink about anything that is going intoclinical practice we just think about itlike we would treat any otherum clinical trial frankly and so we wetake the approach of uh you know what isthe we do the measurements we measureand see what's the efficacy of the modelwhat is the uh the sensitivity thespecificity The Roc and some of the Mayreach a point which needs an FDAapproval not everything in in healthcareneeds an F as the FDA approval and wehave an elaborate process and in fact adedicated team that looks at software asa medical device yeah and so but thethere's a determination made early on aswe bring in new features to say well isthis a software as a medical device orthis is more of a diagnostic Aid whichdoesn't meet the bar of often the FDAapproval type of scenario but even inthose in general yeah it's a greatexample we uh we're working on some veryinteresting use cases on um low risk forthe patient but or for the provider butpotentially high value in reducingadministrative burden and loads allright yeah Healthcare there's like awhole like they call it alarm fatigue Ithink it's called yeah yeah and it'slike basically there's so many devicesthat are being cautious that it may getoverloaded with alarms which means youknow when everything's an alarmnothing's an alarm is that right youjust have too many uh red lights thereyou know what to do and so and and theproblem with something like generativeAI in this case is you don't know so inin some cases the green is actually badand the red is actually good so so youhave to think about it it's like golfscores right and then there's continuousparameters what may be normal forpatient one is not normal for anotherpatient and and so there's a lot ofconsideration what the approach thatwe've been taking is just think about itlike a scientific process and when itcomes to diagnosis and and cures oranything in the clinical practice butthat's why I think of the other onewhich is small AI where we can do a lotmore sure uh for from a patientsatisfaction perspective from you knowwe all have been to a doctor's office noone likes the experience we still haveto digitize a lot of things but I thinkAI can have a significant and fasterimpact in those areas as well I feelyour pain I worked at Pfizer for a longtime so I can understand the the theprocess and the validation and theReally the the care in which you have tomonitor and manage patient informationuh luckily I work now in an industrywhere we're not dealing with patientinformation so they're much less yeah soour approach is particularly withregenerative AI we've taken the approachof failing fastso like software development the genderof AI features we've taken a very agilemethod approach to it where we willDesign develop and deploy a generativeAI API we will treat that pipeline likea software pipelinesimilar to CI CD we'll try to createrepeatable patterns for the particularuse cases that we're going to implementso that they become declarative overtime and we a B test all the features tofind out what are winners and we have amethod in which we measure thosefeatures which we call nipbd which isreally around how much additionaloperational efficiency or revenueis generated by this new feature and howit impacts the customer and so that'show we gauge if a feature will go to 100live and be a full-fledged feature onour platform or we'll shut it down andthen we'll move on to the next one whatabout what like a random percentage ofuse would that happenum no we're we're pretty we're prettystrict in how we do a b testing okay sowe'll take 25 50 75 of the traffic andwe'll a B test it against the featurethat's currently in production and willmonitor to see if that feature has apositive or negative impact on on ourplatform yeah I was going to say I useyour website to rank hotels all the timeso thank you for that yeah it made mylife so much betterumOkay cool so let's say you've got yourmodel running you've got it trainedyou're happy with your data you've got acouple new features you've rolled themout some work some didn't fineuh adoption not necessarily useradoption but maybe internal adoption howdo you get people maybe employees or Iguess users to adopt it and when you runinto adoption like maybe it workstechnically but it's not successfullyused what do you what's the firstquestion you ask how do you how do youapproach this problem well from from ourthere's two parts of what I would saythe generative AI architecture there'sthe back-end architecture that is reallypowered by gender of AI studio andproducts like vertex where you're reallycreating the machine learning CI CDpipeline to create apis that can getconsumed on the front end gotcha so thefirst is really educating our back-endEngineers to be best in class dataEngineers to create repeatable pipelinesof generative AI apisthe second uh piece which is probablythe higher learning curve is teachingyour front-end Engineers to be reallygood prompt engineers and tohave them walk through the developmentcycle of creating compelling promptsthat drive conversion you could haveoutstanding generative AI capabilitieson the back end but if your promptsaren't very good you're not going to getany conversion on on your platform sothat's why it's very important thatyou're capturing real-time Eventing datafrom your customers understanding whattheir intent is and then taking aniterative approach to improving yourprompts I feel like you're usingexperience research to get that thatquestion or is it is it intuitiveumI think it's it's a combination of ofhow you design and develop productswithin your company there's for for usthere's a ton of discipline aroundproduct management product research andthe way in which the engineering andproduct management teams engage todevelop those prompts okaybut I was going to take a very differentangle on adoption for us adoption hereis our customers adoption in our caseit's doctors it's nurses it's patientsand and traditionally you know and Ithink this is going to be the same thingwith generative AI is any new feature isjust in yet another widget right and mydoctors keep saying well I already have25 digits on my screen you put in a 26thwidget oh well why should I go there andI think we have to pay really closeattention and we I'm not saying anybodyhas really solved this really well butif you click close attention to whatvalue is it providing and why shouldthey adopt this and if we can even solvetwo or three well that's the one reasonI'm absolutely going to go and dothere's a product we built some timeback uh we call it the the parking lotapp for the doctor they would come inthe morning because they're going to dorounds on 15 patients and usually theresident is providing some summaries forthem but you say well what if I gave youa summary of what's happened to theseyour five patients of Interest overnightin just as email summary yeah right andyeah it's kind of a recommendationengine and that was great and the onlyway to deliver it is through the AI chatbot but then you got them hooked ontoone thing that is now going to bringthem back over and over again so justlike we think of any other product wehave to think very closely about what'sthat hook that you're going to bring inbring them in because otherwise you'd bebuilding all these great features and noone's ever going to use itit's a real worryso all of your questions actually boughtfeature iteration adoption I think alesson that we should take is have yourdata ready to evaluate against so as youiterate as you apply AI what is yourgolden set We call we call it golden settime times golden training setand this way as you iterate you couldsee and this could be a b this could beother means everyone has a differentmeans of being able to have a golden setand evaluate against that and this wayyou can see okay here's how much itimproved and in some cases it will notit's also important to be able to sailquickly as well and also when it comesto adoption when you have data it's justso much easy to convince anyone right soso it helps with that as well that'sgreat that's um I've seen some adoptionsthey added a new feature and it made themodel work but people liked using itmore and I was like that's that's adecision you have to make I guess atthat pointum I want to make a make sure we haveenough time to talk about we've talked alittle bit about generative AI I want tomake sure we talk because it's noquestion it's the buzzwordum I gave a talk uh in May of 2022 ongenerative Ai and only two people showedup I gave the exact same talk a littlelike eight months later and there was athousand people I mean it's like therise of this has been astronomical andI'd say like generative AI has been wasthe fourth section of AI that kind ofwas lagging and then all of a sudden nowit's skyrocketed to the top which issuper fun to watchum it was for you Brock uhhow is generative AI changed the AIworld yeah yeah and I think we talked alittle bit about it but I'll mentionmaybe two important aspects first of allof you lots of the customers herethey all want I mean they all came to usand wanted to do AI in several years agoyeah it was just that at the timeyou really needed lots of AI expertisedata scientists machine learningengineers in your teams and I think onething that generates AI really changedis that now everyone literally can buildAI applications probably easilyrelatively easy as well from AIpractitioners to developers to businessusers as well like literally everyoneeverybody in the universe so I thinkthat's one big change and the second oneis is the training datait used to be that you need to figureout what your training data is you needto collect straining data you need tolabel that I think most of that is ismuch more minimized right now ingenerative AI as well so when youcombine the two of two of these all of asudden the pace of innovation the designwas already there yeah but the pace ofinnovation now is just you talk aboutthe foundation model so basically domost of the most of the data for youright and then absolutely you mightstill need to tune it with additionaldata but it's nowhere in comparison towhat you had to do before Cody was greatI I learned how to code in college and Idid it for years and then you know inthe last few years it wasn't my job todo that anymore and it sort of fell offand then Cody came out and I was likeI'm back you know it was it was like Icame right back it was so it was so muchfun kind of get back into it so uh fishMarty what do you think how isgenerative AI changing AI I think it'sbasically democratized the ability to domachine learning in Naium I started my career off as a c plusprogrammer designinguh you know Equity Arbitrage and andprogrammatic trading and so we had ateam of 50 data scientists that all wedid was design and develop the algorithmfor uh arbitraging stocks and doingprogram tradingnow you would probably need five peopleto do that and so it's reallydemocratized the ability for thesethings to get adopted across theEnterprise I don't think in five yearswe're going to be talking aboutgenerative AI anymore it's just going tobe another method for How We Do softwaredevelopment yeah it's just me the AI andwe'll just kind of almost assume it'spart of the process yeah I mean I thinkyou know so I'll give you what happenedat Mayo Clinic what we decided is youknow we really want to see what this canbe done and so about two weeks ago weannounced a request for applicationsacross our Enterprise and said anyonewho has an idea write up a two-pager andwe'll fund a POC and within two weekswe've had about 350 different teams whenhalf of them are not three quarters ofthem have never done programming beforeto talk about democratization whatgenerator has done is really spark thatinterest that people have seen are ableto see they can log on to Bard or chatGPD or whatever they want and see whatit can do for them right and so now theyhave immediately the ability to identifyan unmet need that previously you neverthought of know who's going to solvethis problem because of we haveEnterprise priorities and the bigpriorities are building uh you knowdiagnostic systems but suddenly I thinkit is opened up a a flurry of ideas andwe'd love to see how we can execute onall of those but it's just opened upthat thinking that everybody can solveproblemsI mean everyone's talking about thelarge language models they're gettinglarger and they're absurd they're huge Iguess now gigantic is probably the wordwe should useum what have you guys learned from theselarge language logs it's a littledifferent way of doing AI right we'vealways had the training day like youwere saying label it train it and gofrom there now you get handed based on apre-trained model and you sprinkle yoursmarts on top is probably the lightestway to say it what have you learned fromlarge language models what interests youwhat I I think two real critical pointsiswe've taken a trust but verify approachwith the large language models theyhallucinateand so you know really doing iterativedevelopment and marrying them withauthoritative sources of data that canactually train the large language modelaround accuracy has been importantum hence I was talking about beforewhere we use an approach of Langchaining together large language modelswith authoritative sources of locationand placement data has been critical forus to get hallucinationsum way down and then I think the thesecond big thing is really around theThe Prompt engineering pieces and listenthe one lesson that we learned is youjust you cannot justput in generative Ai and thinkeverything is going to work correctlyit's really built on a foundation ofhaving very good data so that yourprompt engineering is accurate enough touse the large language model but alsouse authoritative sources of data to getto the right outcome for your customersand I think your question was a verygood question in terms of it's not aboutgenerative AI it's about language modelsright and so that two different thingsand it's not all about genitive modelsand the analogy I use is you know whenthe if you just had a big chip and theCPU and you didn't have power for theCPU or you didn't have a GPU to run yourgames back in 15 years ago but yourcomputer was pretty useless and so youhave to think about this that's ourlearning if you think about this as anecosystem of of data of tools likelanguage and others I'm excited aboutthe vertex extensionsand and models not just one large modelbut many separate individual models thatcan together provide awesome Solutionsokay but the CD-ROM tray when thecomputer is off[Laughter]really touched on really importantpointsumyou need to really combine largelanguage models with with you know Iwould actually call it directly searchum accessing you know factual fresh dataat the same time like I wouldn't uh andthen through extensions through throughother means of search or accessing dataas well but I wouldn't undermine that Iwould actually like even while you'restarting okay where is my source ofTruth which data I need to searchthroughdo I need to use some sort of searchsolution for that do I need to use anextension for thatum do you need to search the web like Ithink these are things that you probablyneed to ask because for manyapplications summarization conversationchats like we're hearing like this isthe number one thing okay sometimes itholds nice and even when it hallucinatesit's very confident right so so I thinklike combining with search like thinkabout it on day one absolutelyum and then I think you'll be much moresuccessful in your application we did itwe did a project with um uh a divisionof the military and the large languagemodel kept thinking that Roger was aperson but in the military Rogers aconference not a person it's a you knowRoger that Roger's not involved you knowlike and we actually once we fine-tunedthe data it actually the the modellearned that Roger is not a guy it'sjust a confirmation that's important youdon't want to mistranscribe that rightyeah that's why it's so important tohave really good data assets internallyright because the large language modelit's based upon what it knows of theinternet it doesn't it's not necessarilytrained out of the box on your own datasets yeah Roger's on the internet forsure for sureit's like six months nine months yeah ayear ago right yeah so even that is yeahstatic yeah exactly I agree I think forGmail to generation is something we arereally doubling down the arm becausethat's how you ground your answersum Marty you mentioned the connectedtrip yes can you I don't know what thatmeans explain that the connected trip isthe ability for an individual consumerto be directly tied with the productthey bought from the search experienceto the pricing experience to the bookingexperience of the post-bookingexperience so providing a platform thatgives a customer a complete view intotheir booking and post-bookingactivitiesum and and being able to send signals tothat customer during that process thatcreates a better experience for them soif I'm you know currently on a trip toItaly sending a signal to a consumerabout a potential restaurant that'sclose to their hotel or an activity thatthey may want to purchase for their kidswhile they're on vacation or up The Pathit's recommending you know prices basedon user preference whether I'm travelingwith four kids or by myself andpersonalizing that experience in a waythat meets the needs of the consumer atthat given moment well that's complexthere's a lot of models in there yesthere's a lot of models so a lot of workto be doneum we only have a few minutes so I wantto make sure we get into how youactually achieve this Jenny I think sodid you just let your developers or allyour employees run wild did you set up acenter of excellence was it a SWAT teamwas it a hackathon what was the methodyou got up and runningum I think it was aum a top-down and a Bottoms Up approachum we have a uh a fantastic CEO who getstechnology in a way where he was drivingour leadership team to embrace and takeon generative AI at the same time we hada hackathon where we had our entiredevelopment Community coming up withhacks but they were hacks that weregeared towards themes for providing abetter experience for our our consumerslike a mission oriented yeah it wasbasically we had a contest around youknow what uh you know a category was youknow uh the best general of AI hack foruh consumer experience and so we had awhole host the teams that participatedin that and then we we actually workedvery closely with our with our partnersto really understand and learn what itreally meant from a technicalperspective so all three of those reallycame together and also uh Glenn Fogleour our CEO at booking Holdings is verypassionate about the spaceand and for us we're really a technologycompany so for us to not do anythingwould be irresponsible i that I hearthat a lot it's like the people I'm notworried about people that are here atnext I'm worried about the people whoaren't even aware that this is happeningyou know no I think the same thinganything our CEO has been a bigproponent he heum we organized a Enterprise Retreatabout two months ago and we made this uhan Enterprise priority without Board ofTrustees and so subsequent to that froma technology perspective we took anapproach that we have a three-prongapproach we first felt we needed some agroup of people that we call thisdemystifythese people can take this technologyand quickly iterate in two three daysand say do we use Lang chain or do weuse something else do we use guardrailsor do we use uh Lang chain or how do wedo so this technology is changing sofast you need a really set of people whoare demystifiers then we built thesesmall teams of three or four people whocan prove that demystification can go toa POC we call them as tiger teams andthese and then we use some simpleFrameworks we're using radio orstreamlit to Showcase these simple appsthat can say hey this is what it can dofor you then and now we're at the stagewe say okay well let's identify a wholebunch of candidate candidateproducts and then build product teamsthat can take this to a real uh solutionand one thing I hear from lots ofcustomers is they do hackathons as youmentioned and I think it's a great wayfor lots of people put their hands dirtyand learn learn quickly because they'reusually you know time framed as wellyeahokay I think that's all the time we havefor today I learned I wish this hadhappened maybe six months ago I probablywould have saved everyone a lot of timeon my team so thank you very much let'sgive it a hand for our panel membersthank you thank you Barack Marty andBish appreciate your time your insightsI think you're taking taking theinitiative on this kind of stuff weappreciate itforeign"
