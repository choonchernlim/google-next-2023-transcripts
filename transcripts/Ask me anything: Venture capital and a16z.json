    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thank you for joining us at a veryspecial VC ask me anything at next orAMA the VC AMA is our monthly Serieswhere we bring together folks from TheVenture Capital industry to talk aboutthemes what they're seeing what theythink is interesting going on in thespace right now so I'm Ryan kiskis Ilead the startup in Venture Capitalecosystem here at Google cloud and uhtoday with me is Jennifer Lee investmentpartner at Andreessen Horowitz thank youfor joining us thank you so much forhaving meum Jennifer leads data infrastructureanalytics Investments at Andreessen opensource developer tools collaborationapplications she also sits on the boardsof 11 Labs mother duck and stacker andalso a board Observer at a number ofother and recent portfolio companies aswell prior to joining Andreessen she ledproduct at solvi and uhstarted bringing conversational AI tothe customer experience and also LEDuser onboarding and freemium products atapp Dynamics acquired by Cisco for 3.7billion dollars so you've seen somesuccess along the way as well it wasdefinitely a very fun journey I canimagine soumso I wanted to to kick off a little bityou've come from the startup spaceyou're an entrepreneur uh you know leadproduct teams what if you could tell usa little bit more about your journeyinto Andreessen and what brought youthere yeahum it was actually a very I guessunplanned Journey where I've alwaysknown about like venture capital I wason the startup side really loved what Iwas doing and building products that areyou know hopefully improving a lot ofbusiness users developers workflow andagain I still think product is one ofthe the most exciting roles out thereand at the this transition time in 20152016 there was already a lot of chattersabout ml AI like how it's going tochange the world how it's going tochange how we work uh it was one time Iwanted to pick my head up and I wasthinking about where can I you know getto see the Horizon and get to see youknow all the exciting things people arebuilding and that's also when theopportunity from Andrews Horowitz riseup and my initial plan was actually tojust you know learn about industry learnabout you know the exciting uh you knowTechnologies people are building andhopefully either go back to operating uhor even starting my own company but uhthroughout the years I get to partnerwith really really amazing people andFounders and invested in sort of acouple waves of very exciting technologyTrends going from data moving into thecloud to now a lot of exciting gender AItechnology and felt I was you know theluckiest person in the world to be ableto you know partner closely and see howthese technology ever evolutionized whatwe're using and building day-to-day yeahI'm wondering um could you share a bit Iimagine your experience of solving appDynamics you're able to bring some ofthat product experience and productexpertise to the founders you work withI'm wondering how that shows upyeah the one I guess biggest lessonthat's that Drew me into product andstill like I think about day to day isthe empathyum that we have uh first with customerswith usersum as a product person and as a you knowboard member partner to to entrepreneursuh empathy will bring into every meetingevery conversation uh to go along withyou know exciting but also uh turbulentJourney with building companies that tome is you know carrying from uh theoperating role to to a venture capitalit's it just you know the same thinggoing going forwardum but on the other side like justtalking about a day-to-day of likeevaluating and understanding uhproducts and Technology like there isalways a time when certain uh userbehaviors are emerging certain you knowmodality that's you know started beingembedded into a lot of products we'reusing day to day likeproduct sense as well as experienceworking with customers working with youknow large amount of users does help alot with evaluating and understandingwhythis company and why this time so itdefinitely comes very handy andespecially I focus on very muchinfrastructure Investments developertools having sort of the technicalbackgrounds as well as like buildingsuch products does help you know goinginto the board meetings and working withfoundersumI'm wondering if you could share a bitmaybe how your path differs from youknow other folks at Andresen like youknow I remember when you bring thatexpertise to the firm as well yeah a lotof actually people hereAnderson Horowitz has built on thispremise of like you knowwe had a lot of Partners came fromentrepreneurial or founder backgroundsor a lot of operating backgrounds wealso have like a large operating teamthat works alongside of the investmentteam to enable and help our companies togrow and scale so umone side uh my experiences or backgroundis not that different coming from theoperating background but on the otherhandum I think one very interesting thingthat happened between I guess 2012 to 22still now is how uh Enterprise is beingconsumerized and how a lot of tools thatused to be sold are being adopted andthe users becoming uh you know morefront and center for adoptingtools infrastructure SAS applicationslike we become the voice in thatdecision making and buying process andthat that is a journey I think I got tosee firsthand through app Dynamics we'regoing through the transition of you knowAPM what's being sold top down toEnterprises I.T departments butdevelopers have a say of which tool Iwant to use which product is the bestlike data dog is like the best proofexample of that in app Dynamics was alsolike trying really hard to you know besort of the developer brand as well andI was working on their product exactlyand when I went to solve it that's likea b2b2c product is also how do we polishand build a very Sleek user interface sonot just a customer wants to buy butthey're a customer the end user wants touse like that's a lot of the thinkinggoing in theum in in the theme in in those buildingtime and when I joined venture or joinedengine Horowitz we started moreinvesting along the themes of likebottom app developer toolsproducts that are you know goingdirectly into Data scientists dataanalysts DBT is a great example it'sopen source but it's being adopted bydata Engineers analysts Engineers fromyou know teams level than to Enterpriseso that experience that I was able tobring inum is probably where it's different fromsome of the other investors yeah itmakes sense it must be great for thefounders and the teams you're workingwith to have access to that as well fromThe Firm so yeahum it's obviously beenum you know a bumpy couple months youknow a year or so in the startup spaceand I wonder if we could you know pivota bit to some of the you know yourinvestment thesis now what are youseeing what's exciting you these daysof markets infrastructure never goesaway like software is built on top ofyou know thelevels and different bricks and Legoblocks like uh wherever like you knowthe waves come in and go on theapplication side or what people areexcited about consumer application wiseor you know F3 crypto like there'sstill a lot of infrastructure to bebuilt to enable Builders developers tobuild upon and these are you knowsystems databases foundationaltechnology like AML so those are youknow just a theme we continue to beexcited and bullish aboutumuh definitely one of The Core theme andInvestmentsthe firm and myself has been making inthe data infrastructure Worldturned out today like you cannot run anyAML systems without having large amountof data without having a very robust youknow data warehouse data Lake engine youcannot you knowderive insight to understand users andwhere do you inject a lot of the moreintelligent features and functionalitiesso that's still a theme that I'm veryexcited about and mother duck is one ofthe examples of how to bring that to youknow a browser to application layer howto you know run analytics device likethat's a very exciting future and ofcourse it's a lot of attention beingturned into likehow will this wave of like Jennifer AIchange user behaviors transform existingIndustries we have been placingInvestments and Bets throughout theyears like even from five six years agoas I was saying you know a lot of thefirst timeyou know and now uh infrastructure beingbuilt we're investing investors incompanies like tecton rasa these arelike feature store or conversational AIcompanies and now we're continuing tomake investmentsum in uh such spacesboth on the foundation model layer aswell as on the infrastructure layer hasyour you know AI is obviously very muchtop of mind you can see it around mostof Moscone right now as well there's Aiand a lot of thingsum you know how have you changed yourthesis or what areas like have reallyemerged you think or maybe differentthan what you've seen over the pastcouple years you've been investing in AIcompanies for for years and years now soI'm wondering how that has shifted inthe current environment so the the mostimportant and interesting thing that wehave learned in the last six months likewe always thought AI or and now it'slike a foundation again infrastructureplay and there are a lot of likeespecially when technology comes aboutthe adoption goes from like Enterpriseto Consumer but this wave actually comesthe other way around most of the firstadopted products are actually going fromconsumer and then uh you know gbt blewup in in weeks of time and make journeyand like a lot of you know companies wehave invested in even though they'reprobably traditionally looking like moreinfrastructure companies are first goingafter consumer 11 Labs is one of ourrecent Investments That does voicecloning text-to-speech like realisticvoices and massive adoption from theconsumer and creators like leveragingtechnology in many many different waysand use cases we have never even eventhought of or dreamed about like it wasless of oh we know this is a like matureMarket there's going to be technologydisrupting it but this time it's morelike we're shocked by how consumers justtake these you know again modularapproach and composing and putting themtogether building like a her buildingtheir personal assistants building youknow very interesting character that'sI think something like very very uheye-opening to me of just seeing youknow these companies emerge that carriesboth a consumer brand but as well asvery deeply grounded uh and uh deepunderstanding of like how to buildlarge-scale infrastructure yeah that's agreat point you think about like howsoftware has been adopted in differentways over the entire history of it youknow someone's had like very consumerindividual oriented applications thatcan get picked up by Enterprises and youknow adopted and grown from there sothat's uh it's really great to pick upand see that Trend kind of happeningagain here yeah one of the um you tellme you mentioned something there one ofthe things that we talk about on theteam honestly is quite a lot as well isyou know there was some thinking aboutAI as as a vertical right as a specificspace within the overall technologyindustryum and and the debate Now is really isit's more of a horizontal right it'stouching you know almost every industryum you know across the board and I'mwondering how you see that like and howyou know in terms of how does that showup in the companies you're looking forand what catches your interest yeah it'sa very good question and it's a debatewe have internally all the time of likeyou know horizontal technology andInvestments or do we take a veryvertical approach into like looking atcertain industries and how thetechnology will go transform like howpeople adopt and use software I thinkboth I think on many levels especiallyinfrastructure is always you knowhorizontal if you're building againinference engines You're Building likeserverless platforms like these arehorizontal Technologies again that cansupport running large models or likerunning inference I scale or on the edgeum and at the same time like if it'sagain likeAPI that's generating uh images or Voiceor you know text like that's a veryhorizontal technology that can be usedin sales marketing or like in you knowlegal tools like it's very veryhorizontal but at the same time thereare certain verticals uh will befaster transformed or disrupted by thetechnology than others I like to thinkit's more you know new use casesemerging than actually a completedisruption in this time around but youknow we can't have debate on that tooin certain verticals such as you knowcreative tools or likeumyou know design like these are verticalsthat I think uh a lot of the currentTechnologies good enough to go in andlower the barrier of creating certainassets and like manifesting people'sideas and that people doesn't have to bea pro like myself when I was using uhyou know a lot of the image generationtools I feel like I'm a proum where in Industries such as legallike it's very it turns out to be veryright for you know technology such asthis you don't have to sift through alot of the PDF documentations accountinglike you can again like read throughdocumentation in minutes if not secondsto find the information you need andit's just like a great productivity yeahboost for have you found companies thatare really trying to bring some of thesegenerative AI tools to a particularspace particular industry and being verydisruptive there I'm wondering how thatcatches your interest yeah I havepersonally spent a lot of time on the ona creative tour and design space and ourteam Even build a fewprototypes and open source projects tojust think about how you know General AIcan change like game design like gameStates we would build a this project AITown that's like putting Again Jenniferagents into a town and use it togenerate interesting conversations butalso just a theme musicand scene setting like a lot of theseare all generative components being puton like a traditional game engine butpersonally I've just been you knowreally looking atagainif it's a you knowproduct team or design team or marketingteam I think most of the time like youdon't have enough time or budget to putout you know very highly production andhigh quality uhartifacts all the time like how doesthis current either text to image textto video image to video products canenable marketers or semi-technical youknow audience to be able to create againreally high qualityproducts to to put out yeahI'm wondering um you know we spent sometime talking about how the usage ofgender event and some of these toolshave the potential to really disruptlike the very practical day-to-day likeexperiences of folks work in theseindustries I'm wondering how you thinkabout investment in those very likepractical tool-oriented startups versusfolks who may be more research orientedmore foundational design to look at whatwe might be doing to push forward theoverall industry how do you think aboutInvestments maybe those two differentareas yeah it's a good question it'slike many times as early stage you mustare we invest in teams that may not evenhave a productand other times we invest in productsthat already has millions of users ormillions of Revenue uh one of theexamples that we now it's public so Ican talk about it is this company calledidealgram that is a new text to imagemodel uh was launched last week and whenwe invested in the team datehaven'treally even thought through what they'regoing to build but this is probably thebest model building team actually camefrom from Google as well thank you forthatum uh that that you knowum be it this like large Foundationimage model andum we knew they're the expert uh in thespace of like being able to train suchlarge modelsum in uh you know or taking a bet ontheir Technical know-how and theirapproach in tackling the space eventhough we don't even quite know whatexactly is a business opportunity yetbut one of my partners like to say thisis uh this is Fusion reactor this isnuclear power like you you launch itoutside consumers will want to use itand adopt it like you know they're gotto be a path they can figure it outum where on the other side like 11 Labswho which we invested in earlier likethey already are the tool that creatorsandum uh uh you know uh movie studios orlike podcasters are going to to use forpremium voice because uh in certaintimes when uh you don't want to or havethe resources to find and hire uh eithervoice actor or redo some of the voicesthey have recorded this is a technologyyou can bring in and they already haveagain massive adoption and good brandand then we choose to invest uh slightlylater that's a series Investments sowe'll take sort of different approachesand where we see opportunity that'salready manifesting in like you knowuser behaviors or in other times willtake a little bit of you know technologyrisk maybe and you know team risk but wewe know there is you know somethingreally fundamentally differentiated it'sgreat to see you guys like you've gotInvestments at both ends of thisspectrum as well and comfortable goinginto whatever Direction you find thebest the best teams yeah and that'shonestly the most important thing is youknow Finding really the best teams hasyou know great ideas and vision and justyou know ruthless execution becausethere's you know definitely a lot of uhenergy around the space but being ableto capture that is a totally differentgame yeahum you know we still very much feelsthat the the world is being changed veryrapidly but we're very much in the veryInnings of this overall you know AIshift that is happeningum I'm wondering if there are there'spatterns or other learnings from youknow previous significant shifts thathave happened you know in the overalltechnology space and you know that's youknow the web average in the first placemobile SAS applications I'm wondering ifthere's patterns that you try to bringto your founding teams to help help themnavigate through this as well yeahumanalogies people on Twitter or like inuh dinner uh room settings talk aboutlike howthis aiv that's similar to mobile orsimilar to when that came about or is itsimilar to a cloud like because it'shorizontalI think every time when there is a hugetechnology shift it brings a completelydifferent you know change of industry ordynamic into the world like we can findsome resemblance to to the past butum just because of Technology likehow it's being adopted as well as howit's being built is completely differentfrom let's say cloud is about like youknow shifting and sharing and also likereal-time access to a lot of the thecompute and data or I thinkif history give usum any lessons in these last few uhyou know technology shift is it's alwaysexpending the market like we just knowthe software market right now we'restill scratching the surfaceas venture capital is seeing through thecompanies going to you know distributeand sell software we know there's somuch you know part of the world or likeeven within where we think SiliconValley is very advanced in adoptingsoftware there are still many manyplaces that can useum software or like us as software userscan enhance our productivity through youknow new softwareum the the the tremendous increase of uhtotal addressable market and opportunityis just massive andI think that's again two Founders themost exciting change is it doesn't haveto be disrupting any existing playersthese are new markets being formed toenhanceeither business user or a productperson's day-to-day or Engineersday-to-day or to the end user consumersday-to-day for them to build somethingthat they have never imagined to be ableto they don't have to go through yearsof education to be a designer they'llhave to go through years of education tobuild software they can you know adoptagain like local local tools they canadopt like design products that aregenerative to express our creative ideasand I think that is honestlywhat makes me most excited about what'scoming up next very coolum one of the things that we've seenobserving the startup space as well isthatum it is sometimes easy perhaps a littlebit too easy to you know add a bit of AIto this right and you see maybe honestlylike pitches that may look verysomething very similar to amazing acouple years ago but now it's got an AIbeen flavor to it I'm wondering you knowhow do you parse through that how do youtry and find the teams that maybe reallyhave the expertise the knowledge thedepth to build a really transformativecompany in this space versus some thatmight be adding that bit of the sprinkleon thereyeahumI think of that question as likeumit'skind of like when we're thinking aboutadding AI into again software andproducts it can be a very thin layer ofAI that you know gives 10x gainand like a writing software like that'sagain with some generous approach youcan go 100 miles longer wearing otherproduct areasyou have to build very very deep toreally elaborate capability if itrequires a lot of accuracy if itrequires a lot of consistency like againthe software layer that either guides orcontrolsor uh you knowumpushes where where the AI can can beleveraged and used have very differentflavors yeahI can give you a couple of examples onlike um the companies we have seen andleveraging AI I think that yeah it'sinteresting to say like there might besome of those verticals we're justtalking about where might be there'sdisruption that is ripe for AI but maybeit is just bringing in a bit of thatlayer onto it versus having to do like afoundational model in a new space orsomething exactly I spend a lot of timein data both as a product manager likedigging through dashboards and uhanalytics tools and invested in quite afew of them from 510 DBT preset all theway to mother duck like it's pretty muchat this point a table States for like abi tool or for Analytics tool to to havesome sort of like you know text to SQLor ask natural language questions andget some answers like that's I think apretty easy First Step adoption andagain once you know it's proven to bemostly working like everyone startedadopting and building into thesefeatures but if you really want toderive insights from like the tables thedata you'll have and not just to ask aquestion and get a simple like retrievaldata point that's your massiveundertaking and we know there are teamsactually building Foundation models tojust do analytics work so there's like avery easy again productivity enhancementby leveraging try gbt gpt4 gbd 3.5 inthe products but there also verticalproducts going to be built around thisbeing built on like really understandingand being able to debug be able to askand get go back and forth on questionsof like how do you want to understandthe data give me likereports insights um on a daily hourlybasis that's a very different approachwords on the uh let's say workflowautomation side which I think still is avery untapped Market we all useum you know zapier asum I guess and end user tool and thereare like RPA products that areautomating a ton of like large-scaledocuments and processes like there aremany many places to to ingest uh AI intothe existing tools of like you knowwriting these Integrations building yousort of a workflow automation end-to-endusing a agentic you know architecturebut at the same time like ourinvestments instabase is again likeleveraging gpd4 leveraging their ownFoundation model to really process largeamount of long data information to helpautomate things end to end so it's againlike very different approaches but Ithink there's room for both sides toeither just use AI to improveactivity but also massively changing howthis wholesoftware being being built and adoptedI'm in the audience here how many of youare founders of a startupI got quite a few ends how many wouldyou how many of you had maybe AI as partof the core product or like you knowconsidered an AI first companyso yeah still a few quite a fewum I'm wondering I mean for folks whomaybe want to be building in this spaceto figure out how to bring it into theirstartup what advice would you give themabout how to build some of their skillsand understanding of how they could bebringing AI to what they're buildingyeahum we always think you know Founders areexperts and we see patterns and you knowwe canyou know identify where are some of thepitfalls um Ialways like to to thank for any productsyou have to understand like whatthe existing like user behavior andsoftware look like and as much astechnology can be very disruptiveuser behaviors are not as easilychangeable like what is the most youknowumintuitive and low hanging fruits thatyou canagain ingest into like a few seconds ofaha moments and again that's like youknow where I spend most of the timelooking at products and thinking abouthow do I polish these products into avery easy to adopt very uh I guess uhsmooth onboarding like that's where Ithink for a lot of AI products thebarrier is so low like you like you getmassive gain from like the first fewsteps of like interacting with thesoftware like where can you find thosemoments in the products you're buildingand when you're putting that into againend users hands what are the dynamicthey're already familiar with like whatare the user uh you know interactionsthey're having either with their teamswith their current software like how canyou make AI part of that not likesomething they have to change 180 andhave to like rethink about uh theirprocessing day to day but make it moreof like a smooth adoption curve likethat's where I think sometimes uh youknow founders have a great idea and likeuh jump on it and it's a great softwarebut the connection back to where theusers are at where the market is at canbe improved and that's that's I think uhsomething I I would spend more time onespecially as a technology uhis giving us a lot more low-hangingfruits yeahyeahum if I if I put you on the spot alittle bit are there particular areasaround gender of AI that you think arejust really killer applications rightthese are the ones that are really gamechangers for the space and then alsoconversely are there some areas that ifyou're popular maybe are being pursuedbut maybe you think aren't the bestapplications of AI where we're Foundersmight struggle if they're really tryingto build something out thereumso one of the reasons I actually thinkwhyright now genevia is so top of mind alot a lot of us are using them day todays becausefor Consumer apps it's more faulttolerant like we're fine with looking atthe art that's imperfect we're fine withlooking at some text that's not 100correct because we can self-correct itas humans like we can tolerate that kindof errors but for a lot of software or alot of places the fault tolerance isvery low for example if you're reallylike writing code or being a co-pilot Ithink that's a killer app for sure likeit's enhancing a lot ofum myself and my developer friends uhproductivity but if you're actually justletting the AI write uh you knowend-to-end software or let it to solve aticket let it to you know uhgo deploy kubernetes like it canactually break and blow up things and Ithink for anything that's more uh youknow Mission critical I would say likeless fault tolerant I think there'sstill a long ways to go to understandumwhere again we can find improvementslike security tools I'm I'm veryimpressed and honestly shocked by howgood AI is at catching vulnerabilitiesbut I think there's still certain levelof like human prop engineering andimpulse to be needed to go through someof the very smart and sneaky uh you knowsecurity attacks soum I thinkagain as viewers these are all uh areasthat will have a ton of opportunity forfor AI but it just you know differentmaturity level of how ready yeahcustomers Enterprises are going to adoptit yeah yeah we've seen differentdifferent levels in that uh overallSpectrum like how much is the human inthe loop of some of these processes andI think we're figuring out this you knowagain now with a whole new set of youknow tools and products that are thatare being built what's that right levelyou want to adopt for those differentapplications for sure and I would alsosay I'm very impressed and shocked byhow much gaming industry have been likebear hugging and leveraging the genericcapability yeahum I wonder if you could shift gears abit as wellum you know we touched early on a bitsome of your journey as well and howyou've worked with some of um your thefounders you've worked withum I'm wondering if you had some sometop three maybe Do's or don'ts forFounders as they think about eitherstarting a company or maybe once theystarted trying to get to that you knowhyper growth and hyperscale yeahumthe duesthink are easy[Laughter]I have to think about it more umwe'll start with the dues yeah the deuceis there's so much Tinker energy andamazing work and demos people just putout there and I thinkat least many of my Founders have workedwithhave this like perfectionism in them oflike uh I want to make sure the productyou know just goes always a bang and youknow everybody loves it and but it'snever just like you know go out and 100million users that easily like everyproduct have to go through you knowagain this sort ofiterations and and journey to find theright markets I I would just say likewhat I love about the AI Davis peoplejust like put things out and like don'tcare about you know again mistakes anderrors and all that like do more of thatlike put the products out put it outwhen it's not ready put a user's handsalways getting you know uh reactions andfeedback like you just learn so muchfrom from that experienceum and do talk to a lot ofuh other people and Founders in thespace and I I think this is probablymore true for the technical Foundersthat they like to to buildthey like to like stay in their Zonelike stay in the flow but when you goout and talk to other Founders who areBeauty in the spaceumyou just got to avoid and navigate somuch morethere's some don'ts there too which isyou know don't don't remain too muchbehind closed doors for too long anddon't remain too much in a silo versusinteracting with others who might bebuilding that space as well that's rightyeah very coolumI wonder if you know and this could befrom your you know background directlyat startups that Soldier up Dynamics orfrom Founders you interact with I wonderif there's a pattern of founder Behavioror founder that's really stood out toyouum that you've worked with that yourecommend maybe some others might besome tips and tricks and guidance fromas wellum I think the oneuh biggest differentiatorno competitors orumany Marcus shift going to take awaysorry like I'm losing a little bit frommy voice so let me drink some wateragain we'll take another minute on thatone yeah and preparing you withquestions for for quite a while now aswell yeahum but I love it I love all thesequestionsumI was saying the things that uh you knowthe market or competitors on takeawaysjust really your velocity and shippingspeed and again the more iterations themore products you put out there like themore you're learning from this processlike all of the winning teams that wehave been working with and seeing arejust like you know the best executors intheir own space like nothing can takeaway the speed and again that gives anycompany the biggest wedge because thereare a lot of people talking about modesabout like data modes about technologymodes about you know all this and that Ithink those are all great modes and ifyou you have if you have distributionyou have like a you have calledlightning in a bottle that's great butthere's always going to be the nextplayer come to you know either do itbetter or copy it or whatever like beingable to maintain that sort ofum Edge on like being able to put thingsout fast being able to ship fast beingable to like again run massive multipleiterations I think that's just thebiggest advantage in startup you canalways you know swim and go with theflow no matter if Market turns againstyou or with you like you're always thereand you can always swim and move out ofyou know any sort of danger so I thinkthat nobility is something I always youknow keep reminding my founders ofmaintain no matter how big a team you'rehaving now no matter how much successyou have cannot be you know content andstay still because we're always like awhale dispute has always been one of thegreat differentiators for for startupsas well I remember one of the um thevery first startups of that in my careerthe um the CEO we had an office that wasI mean this room is many many timesbigger than that office was but we youknow he would literally run from likemeeting to meeting like from there tothere but just that little aspect justinfused a bit sort of the culture andreminder to just keep moving quickly andkeep maintaining that speed as adifferentiator for you as a business andthe one like benefit from that I thinkpeople don't realize is that's how youreally keep and maintain and track thebest talent because the best talentalways wants to move fast and like youknow being on the edge and the cost oflike the interesting things and theywant to move fast in the company and inenvironment like that yeahum I know when Andreessen provides a tonof these resources to your Founders aswell but I wonder if you could share abit with the founders hereum any any tips on raising capital andmaybe tips on raising capital fromAndresen in particularyou can come find me afterumIumI think the tips I always give to eitheryou know my own founder is going out fora fundraise or Founders come to me isyou do want to know your audienceandI thinkthis is a two-way street like for forany meetings uh VCS myself going into Iwant to do a lot of research I want tounderstand like who I'm talking towhat's their background how muchinformation you can find online like Ithink the two-way street goes the samefor for founders of like looking reallylooking at you know people who arespending energy and time and uh you knowtalking publicly about what they careabout their thesis like we like to putout a lot of thesis work and writinglong-form Vlogs and you know Twitter isonly one of the forms I think VCS orlike Avenue VCS like to to to take butit's not just that it's like you knowthere are a lot of conversations we'rehaving or events we're building or likeyou know again these uh content we'reputting out just talking about whatwe're excited about and the same for alot of other Venture capitalistsum and investors ngosum like again like people who like tosupport the entrepreneurial Endeavorlike they want to talk public about itand then they want people who arebuilding in in those spaces to hear ittooum so I think sometimes especially whenfundraising can be a very stressful andtime-consuming uh phase like knowingyour audience and knowing where youspend energy and prioritize theconversations that you're having I thinkwill benefit a lot to to the foundersum and I think some people say it's ait's you know a more challenging marketnow because again like you know what'shappening on public side you know a lotof you knowumstartups are likeum having riffs but I still thinkfor at least speaking Francis andHorowitz like we're very very activevery aggressive in making Investmentsbecause we believe you know goodcompanies and Technology can be buildingany time in any marketsum Mark and Ben started the fund in 2009right after the downturn the part I'mworking with Martin Casado actuallystarted his company in 2008 like thereare many many great companies beingemerged in again not sopromising markets but again I thinkthat's the best time to build becauseyou know you don't have a lot ofdistraction and there are still a ton ofcapital out there wanting to supportthese entrepreneurial Endeavors so Ithink it's still amazing time to startcompanies and building great productsyeah there have been amazing companiesthat have come out of any every one ofthe downturns there some of the reallythe world changing ones 100um we wrap all of our amas in this sortof format so I'm wondering if you canumwork here without lightning round withme so I'll ask you umbriefly just you know one topic and giveme your quick thoughts on is it fadingor is it staying is this

yeahsame theme remote workI think that's staying but in differentforms like it's not probably all remoteall at once and for different stages ofcompanies I think sometimes it givesmore benefits and leverage sometimesactually distracts and cuts away like Ihave known a lot more of our early stagecompany started going back to officebecause again in the finding productmarkets that areaand face like
