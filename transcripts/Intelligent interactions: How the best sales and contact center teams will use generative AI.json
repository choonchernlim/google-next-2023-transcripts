to building essentiallywhat we think is the very best contactcenter in the world we'll talk a lotabout generative AI before we getstarted so you have a little context ofwho your two speakers are my name is DanO'Connell I'm our chief Ai and strategyofficer at dial pad I ever see our AIproduct teams and roadmap I wasfortunate to join dialpad for over fiveyears ago they acquired my startup whichwas a real-time speech Rec and NLPstartup called Talk IQ and then Morganhas been with us as our chief marketingofficer for over five years who's alsoat RingCentral prior to dial pad so hegets credit for all of the cool visualsand the designs we're going to start offwith a little bit of video before we hopinto things so again thanks for beingpart of this and uh hearing this talkand then we're going to find time for Qa so as we get into things if you havequestions around generative AI largelanguage models NLP speech Rec anythingthat might be interested you can fireoff any question we're not afraid tohard questions so feel free to askwhatever you'd likeoh we might need volume on this it won'tmake your coffeebut it will help crush your sales goalsit won't clean the fridgebut it will tell you who's happy oncustomer service calls it's not that day[Music]it simply does the busy work for youdial pad AI for customer service salesand team collaboration all in one appdialpad work beautifullyso hey folks Morgan Norman here there'sa reason we introduced this video weactually been running this for quitesome time and it was all centered aroundthat AI doesn't have to be scary andactually there's 42 Easter eggs on thehistory of AI I'm guessing you couldprobably see one of them but they'repretty hard to find the other ones butit's been a really movement piece for uson you know what we're trying to do inthis space so I'm just going to walkthrough a little kind of set the tonewhat we're seeing in the market and Ithink we all know we're seeing theheadlines out there in terms of you knowhow it's going to change work uh all thepromises and all the existing fears buthow many of you actually can't even keepup with the AI news out there todayI mean look around the majority of usincluding ourselves we actually cannotfigure out what's real what's not on aweekly basis a week is actuallysometimes a year in this specific spaceso it's pretty clear to all of us andfor each one of us here at Google nextis like this is this new era it's reallypromising we live in this era of AI andit's probably the biggest potential forany of our careers it doesn't matterwhat specific role you're inand um let me get this next one here andevery industry is impacted by this so Iknow there's a lot of different sessionswe're talking about contact centerthere's a lot of different uh Industriesspecifically here whether it's retailwhether it's Healthcare you heard themdo some demos on State and local but thetruth of it there isn't one that isn'timpacted by this and actually the speedof it is just so rapid most of us can'tkeep up with itin every role so when we think aboutcontact center we're going to talk alittle bit about sales we're obviouslygoing to talk about Service agents butit actually is going across the boardwe're seeing actually people think aboutcontact centers even in recruiting todayDan will talk to you a little bit aboutwhat we're doing there but if you thinkabout whatever your strategy is youmight be the pioneers of this strategyand contact service but we need to kindof help other departments understandwhat we're doing in aai and help themdevelop some plans and we'll give yousome principles that we're seeing acrossthe boardbut the promise for AI is is Big rightso we've all seen the promise and it'sthe question is can we all get there youknow obviously speed to insightsincrease productivity businessintelligence but the real issue and Ithink Dan you're probably best to talkabout this next is the obstacles to getthere are really daunting depending onwhat size businesses you are whatresources you you have yeah I thinkum you know we've been fortunate to beon The Cutting Edge of leveraging largelanguage models to even over 70 yearsago as you said building speechrecognition NLP models and a lot of thisI think the confusion in the markettoday or the challenges comes into theseare all the very real bottlenecks that Ithink engineering team space and thenobviously the consumers of AI which isyou know if I go and leverage a platformdo I know that they're going to protectmy data you know what are the dataretention policies if you're actuallyconsuming the AI you want to know wellhow are these how is the businessactually building these models right dothey have an ethical approach right howare they testing for biases how do Iknow that a model is actually going tobe built for my use caseum so you'll hear me actually get intothe details of building domain-specificand use case specific models and thebenefits of large foundational modelsand where they fit into the stack andwhere you actually want to havesomething that's again more specific tospecific use cases but we've dealt withall of you know building as a softwareBuilders like we've dealt with each oneof these bottlenecks and they're veryreal challenges that are out there todayso we did a we actually do a couple bigresearch studies we're actually doinganother one with Google right now andwhat we're finding is most of the folksuh really don't fear AI this is acrosscustomer service right so they'reactually really more excited but theydon't know what to do about it so if yousee about 70 of sales and customerservice professionals on the left-handside they don't actually fear that it'sgoing to take away their jobs so a lotof the hype we look at back to the Pressperspective is it's a lot of Click baitbut it is causing some problems and it'sup to us as a group to kind of giveClarity right the other piece is there'sa huge opportunity right so they believeit's actually going to help them makebetter decision making and we canalready see that we can actually alreadysee some progress in this and then thekicker is most companies really don'thave a company-wide policy and they andthis is not you're you're probably themost advanced audience in customerservice but the reality is all theseother departments are trying to figurethis out whether it's a design teamwhether it's a specific marketing teamwhether it's an HR team in recruitingbut there's no plan that unifies themtogether and we're running another studyand we're actually seeing this is evenmore complex right now because we wantedto dive into this area so we're allwe're all going to spend some time beingsome Pioneers here but probably one ofthe most important parts is how do wedevelop those plans how do youcommunicate those plans togetherand then when we talk about outcomes Ithink something that many of thecustomers that we engage with these arethe expectations that they haveum I think many of us and I assume manyof you are probably in the contactcenter or service or sales space you getit you want to have a solution that'sproviding the ability to go and sellmore every business on the planet istasked with how do I onboard employeesthere's some fantastic opportunities togo and automate on board providingsuggested answers to questions andsomebody's on a live call will actuallyget in and show off some of these thingsbut I also think that this applies tonot just sales and service but also justgeneral collaboration we talk about theability to go summarize conversations Iremember when we built our speechwreckengine uh eight plus years ago we wereblown away by just having a transcriptof a call and being able to do that inreal time and suddenly now we're blownaway again because you've got largelanguage models that can go take a longtranscript and condense it down to fouror five sentences and do it reallyreally well and so suddenly these vastnew opportunities open up just not incontact center and in sales butobviously for all of us the way we wejust consume data and we think aboutmeeting notes and sharing that sothere's some really interesting thingsthat we're working on on that front wewouldn't be here at Google next if weweren't partners with Google we'refortunate to be one of the firstPartners launch partners for Googlevertex we leverage Google vertex to godo some summarization of transcriptstoday and I actually wanted to show offthis feature and I'll talk into talkabout it but what I think is really coolabout these large language models is notjust the ability to go and dosummarization but their ability tocategorize information and I think itopens up this vast new opportunity forany business that sits on data tosuddenly get really structured data Iremember one of my first jobs that I hadwas actually in Customer Supportfortunately for Google obviously googlerfor 10 years but I actually had at thattime you know back in 2003 I had to goand label data and it's terribly timeconsuming and suddenly you've got largelanguage models like vertex that can gocategorize and provide structure aroundthis and this opens up these reallyfantastic opportunities for analytics soagain I want to show off how we'releveraging summarization today in ashort videoforeign[Music]customer intelligence platform so wepower voice video and meetings on anydevice anywhere in the world and helpbusinesses understand what's happeningin those conversations today we see ourcustomers leverage dialpad and Google'sgenerative capabilities to driveproductivity increases really across theboard we can summarize conversations forthem we can help automate the qualityassurance or the call review processwhat's unique about dotpad is we relywholeheartedly on Google Cloudeverything from our infrastructure thatallows us to have instant deployment andinfinite scale and I think there's justa plethora of opportunities to driveAutomation and assistance thanks toGoogle vertex well we're thrilled thisshow off today are instant summaries ofcalls and meetings along with somereally cool categorization of what'shappening in those conversations sowe'll identify the call purpose and eventhe call outcome so come on down andcheck out this recaphi this is Dan at dialpad how can I helpyou hi there my name is Jim Smith and Iwas following up on a refund that Irequested for my account it has beenprocessed but it will take a few daysbefore it appears as a credit on youraccountwhat I can do is send you an email soyou have a confirmation of that is thereanything else I can help you out with nothat's all I need thanks for all yourhelpso thanks to vertex what you'll see atthe end of every call is an automaticrecap that recap has really fourcomponents it's got a summary which iswe take that long transcript we condenseit down to just four or five sentenceswe identify the call purpose we alsoautomatically identify the outcome andlastly we capture any action items allof this instantly generated thanks toGoogle vertex this is just the start ofour generative AI journey and we'rethrilled to partner with Google vertexto go and power this and a host of brandnew features[Music]cool so it's very meta to see yourselfon video and then Jim Smith actually issitting down there too so I'm gonnalaugh at the whole thing but again theseare just showing off like some of theopportunities that are there and I thinka lot of us again we're caught up inthis idea of summarization that we kindof forget the ability to leverage theselarge language models for categorizationI actually think that's probably one ofthe biggest opportunities again there'sso much categorization that that of datathat goes into whether you're inrecruiting whether in your sales whetheryou're in support Google's been thisfantastic partner for us obviously we'releveraging vertex as I said to helppower that feature but it allows us togo lean into the generative AI story outthe gate works out the box we have thisfantastic experience with it I do wantto share a little bit of our journey toget to this point we have a long historywith Google as I said half of ourexecutive team comes from Google myselfI spent I was fortunate to spend 10years there but our founding teamactually built Google Voice Google atthat time didn't want to commercializethat Google Voice product and the teamleft Google Ventures wrote them thefirst check and that became that becamedial pad Rich Miner is the founder ofthe Android operating system isfortunate to be a member of our boardand we've been heavily invested in thispartnership over the past 12 plus yearsuh this year we've just been recognizedas a cloud technology partner or excuseme a partner of the year so we'rethrilled with this partnership and justhave had a wonderful experienceleveraging both vertex so I'd encourageyou to take a look at things but all ofour stack is built on Google Cloud aswell we're fortunate to be one of thefirst people to leverage Google Cloudway back in the dayum I love talking about data and youhear me talk about conversational datasets and I've always thought ofconversational data sets as really thelast offline data set you know everytime you engage with software we knowhow we interact with software if you usesocial media all of that information istracked but the one thing that wehaven't perfected is we have mediain-person meetings we have phone callswe have video meetings and for the mostpart that data is just not tracked andstructured at dial pad what was helpfulfor us and all of our gen AI Journey waswe set on one of the largestconversational data sets on the planetwe've transcribed over 5 billion minutesof Enterprise conversational data andthat data set has become a reallyvaluable asset for us as we've beenleaning into building a contact centerand a sales Center and leveraging thatacross large language models I thinksomething that that's going to beplaying out in this context Center spaceyou know Morgan asked how many of youare able to keep up with kind of AI inthe news I think the other thing thatwe're going to experience is just thepace of innovation for for every pieceof software not just in the contactcenter contact center side I put thisslide up here not to overwhelm you withfeatures but it was namely to show youlook the introduction of gen Ai andlarge language models are over the pastcouple months and even the past coupleyears because these aren't they didn'tjust magically show up but it's reallydriving the pace of innovation and Ithink that is an important thing torecognize for many of you that work indifferent industries that the pace ofinnovation in your industry is going tochange and I very much think largelanguage models and gen AI present areally unique opportunity to rewritepretty much every piece of software thatwe engage with I think there's massiveopportunities for smaller businesses todisrupt some of the Giants we can talkabout Salesforce yeah I think many of uswould build a database in a verydifferent way today knowing that youhaveai related Technologies like real-timespeech recognition NLP and largelanguage models like you could go writethe database very differentlyumfor us we've been very fortunate of theway that we've always positioned and andlooked at the contact center spaces wethink it's really important to own ourwhole stockum and I think very very many businessesrecognize the efficiencies that you cangain so I think the best contact centersin the world will ultimately start tolook like this which is they want to gopower voice video messaging on anydevice on any Channel anywhere in theworld you want to be able to go have astack that can understand thoseconversations in real time there's nopoint in US building software that cando things after the fact you want to beable to Route calls or you want to beable to drive an escalation or provide asuggested answer to question in themoment that it's happeningyou want to have this data layer becauseagain I think what it's it's not justabout the front-end experience of uhengaging users but it's all about how dowe get gather that uh the data andprovide insights and then you want tohave this unique experience wheredifferent users and different personascan leverage these features we've builtfortunately different features designedfor recruiting teams and sales teams andservice teams and so you've got thisreally nice Universal stack that allowsyou to go drive the pace of innovationyou get some cost efficiencies andbenefits and again can go and maximizethe opportunity that's there we doeverything ourselves on this piece so wedo our own speech recognition as I saidwe meant we built one at the firstEnterprise speech recognition engines wedo all of our own NLP in terms ofsentiment analysis so for those of youthat may not know what NLP is it'snatural language processing it's theability to essentially take text andteach a computer how to understand it sothey can start to map named entityrecognitions or identify things like acompetitor name or sentiment we have ourown semantic search engine which allowsus to provide recommendations in realtime so all of us fortunately engagewith a semantic search engine today withGoogle and then we have our owngenerative AI layer and so we do partnerwith vertex and we also have our ownlarge language model that we announcedat just a few weeks agoumI think when when you think about thenext opportunity it's uh AI interactionsacross all of this in real time and if Ibuild this slide out I think ultimatelyit comes down to how do we usegenerative AI to go and do automationassistance and insights and we do thatacross every channel that's out thereand again being able to do that in realtime that it's happening if we talkabout kind of the the benefits of that Ireally start I think it starts to shiftbusinesses from being reactive toproactive it allows us to be much moreproactive sellers much more proactive onthe service and support side I think itactually shifts contact centers frombeing a cost center to a sales Centerand I think you know some examples ofthat would be customer satisfaction sohow many of you have ever filled out acsat survey or how often do you say Ishouldn't say everyone's going to raisetheir hand uh what I meant is most ofthe time if somebody sends you an SMSsurvey an email survey it probably takesyou a few days to actually reply toand perhaps you know what we've seen isthe people that tend to reply tend to bethe people that are either really pissedoff still or really happy and that givesyou this conflicted view of the worldyou might actually think that you'redoing a really good job in customerservice if you're only paying attentionto the people that are writing andtelling you you're doing a good job sowe think there's opportunities we'vereleased a feature called AIC sot inreal time but in first customersatisfaction from every conversation onany channel and so suddenly youdemocratize and have a much lesspolarized view of customer satisfactionyou do it on every interaction that'sout there and again you can do it inreal time there's no additional softwarethat anybody ever needs to do we thinkthese are really unique use cases thatcontact centers should be leveraging intheir space again it gives you far moredata in real time and you don't have anyof this delay and it's not polarized andI think we'll start to see many more ofthese types of features start to show upin the contact center world for us someother use cases I think many of us havehave heard and seen things like suggestdid answers to questions we know thatpeople hop into a contact center they'refresh new on the job they don't know howto answer something and suddenly you cango pull this information from aknowledge base present them to itopportunities also to to go and automatethe quality assurance process what Imean by that is typically what happensis there's a team that will go andreview contact center calls or salescalls after they've happened and tellsomebody if they're doing a good or abad job immense opportunities again I'llshow some of the features off here to goand automate those processesand to highlight you know some of theseexamples I just mentioned you knowthings like scorecarding so againability to go and automate the qualityassurance process playbooks I think ofthat as a live agenda tracking so manyof us show up to meetings we havecertain topics that we want to make sureare spoken about leveraging a largelanguage model we can go and make surethat those topics are being spoken aboutbut the really cool thing is you canactually guide somebody through theconversation provide them with suggestedquestions to ask we can go and capturethe answer of that question summarizethat that answer back and then write itto a CRM and so I think these are someof the really really unique experiencesyou think of how those can also apply tosay recruiters recruiters have to do alot of the same questions we know I'msure all of us have been in interviewswe probably take kind of bad notes attimes where we forget to go write it inthere all of these are opportunitiesthat will draw that will be automatedfor us in the near future again thanksto generative AIum a few more of the examples just tohighlight some things we showed off thevideo for Recaps which provides thisinstant summarization and categorizationof conversationshe'd have spoken a little bit aboutscorecards which is again the ability togo and help automate the qualityassurance process this is something thatcan be used for both sales organizationsrecruiters service teams playbooks Ijust mentioned which is essentially liveagenda tracking so you'll see here onthe if you can see the slides you knowit'll go and outline what are thespecific things I need to speak aboutbudget I need to confirm a need andtiming we can guide through the rightquestions for that person to be askingand then go and capture the answers thatare coming back from the customer andthen we'll write that information to aCR Ram so we think these are the typesof features that we think every businesson the planet that has a salesorganization or a contact center shouldbe leveragingand these are features that don't justwork for the small businesses thatreally designed for every every industryand every Size customer that's out thereso large and small these are just a fewof the businesses that leverage dial padbut again it's how do we go and build AIpowered features that work for the largecompanies and the largest companies inthe in the in the world but also some ofthe smallest ones that are out therea couple of predictions um when we getinto like AI in the contact centerum I think the chatbot Revolution ishere I think fortunately uh you knowwe've all had this experience withchatbots in the past that are prettygood at password resets uh largelanguage models like vertex havedemonstrated some really really nicecapabilities to help automate much morecomplex workflowsum so we'll start to see thoseexperiences start to pop up I think alsowhat we'll see is just decreased agentchurn I think the one of the the biggestturnover areas in a contact center isthe service agents and they haveprobably the hardest job in the world Idid that job when I first joined Googlebut people are calling you they'refrustrated they're pissed offsomething's broke they want help you getoverwhelmed you have every everythingthat you do is measured your customersatisfaction whether you answeredsomething right or wrong it's a hard joband I think there's these opportunitiesto go and help provide a much betterexperience it's for the agents that arethere that makes their job far easierand decreases the churn for thosebusinesses on that side of the house andthen I think there's ultimately all ofthis leads into like the customers aregoing to be happierI think today in today's day and age allof us expect to go and engage with abrand 24 7. if there's an issue I wantto have some way to contact them I don'twant them to be closed on Friday and wehave to wait till Monday and so I thinkagain we'll start to see always onBrands and ultimately it's going to leadto this experience that allows us tohave a much better experience as usersum something that Morgan has been reallyfocused on um for us and I think youknow just to share a little bit of ourprinciples for AI and to give you somesome thoughts if you're on teams thatare leveraging AI or building around theAISum something for us is we wanted to havethese guiding principles I mean it'sreally important for us to go and makesure that our businesses that lever ourcustomers understand that we care a lotabout privacy your data is your data soyou have your own data retentionpolicies you should be able to controlthat data you have an understanding ofhow we LeverageThe the data sets that we anonymize themthey're opted in we strip them if anypersonal identifiable information andultimately we're building features thatwe use as I said many of us are formergooglers Google does a great job atdoing what's called dog food which isyour your own teams have to leverage theproduct before it goes to GA we do theexact same thing so as we're out therebuilding new features for consumers toleverage we go and test those featuresand make sure that they work and theyhave to work out of the box and just besimple and easy and if not then we goback to the drawing board on thosepiecesso I'm going to hand it back to MorganMorgan's going to talk through just uhsome nine principles for AI work yeahand I'm all happy to jump into q a yeahso we're just we wanted to actually makethis actionable this has been somethingwe've been working on across thousandsof customers but actually all of us areare struggling with this and this isevolving it's actually evolving on aprobably I'd say a 90-day basis sothere's there's nine principles we'refinding across every customer and thisis regardless of what department you'reon the first key is that is there astrategy that's AI for everyone right soyou're going to be a Pioneer when you'retalking to your other peers in thedepartment when we think about everyoneyou even saw from the keynote in Googlehow they're thinking about search how isit going to work for them individuallyand if you're not tackling this as aunified strategy they're going to do iton their own and we're seeing thisacross the board there's everyone'sexperimenting with their specific AItools so you want to get a little bit ofcontrol over that as part of yourstrategythe other piece is is it helpful and isit human does it work and what we meanby this is as is it ready day onethere's a lot of promises in AI wetalked about that a little bit earlierbut we want you to actually have successin AI as fast as possiblehow many of you would guess what theoutcome people want in terms of an Roiand AI how many of you would think it'sless than four weeksnot very many that's actually what thesurveys say people want to see realresults in Ai and any product they'retrying in less than four weeks that's anunheard of speed in Enterprise softwareso think about that as how's it going tobe leveraged what is the usability whatis the design Beyond specific developershow are you going to deploy thatspecific experience and then what's thevalue you talked about the outcomes isDefine those values as fast as possibleanother one fair and inclusive I'm notgoing to go fully into this this is alot about the language models we alsohave Jim Palmer VP of engineering if youwant to talk about that feel free to asksome questions but one of the biggestissues is what's in the specific modelhow do you retrain that model andthere's so much information about thisright now but I'm not the expert to talkabout ituh real world impact right so do youknow the impact you're trying to getwhatever you're deploying right do youactually know the impact you're tryingto get do you know the Roi you're tryingto get do you actually know theusability metrics you're trying to getand just think about that as you deploycontact centers so it's not anexperiment but you can really have somequick successes across the board thereanother one data is the new currency sowhether we believe conversational datais probably some of the most valuabledata on the planet but do you have abroad data strategy and actually how areyou unifying this data and how are yougiving others access to that data andcan they take action from it and getinsights from it so a lot of the data'sthere but no one can get insights in itand I mean from the business usersbecause if the business users can getinsights they can actually determine youknow what you want to do next from aroadmap perspective and obviously trustand privacy insecure so we do centeraround the good AI this is alwayssomething we're learning about if youhaven't read that read the headlineslike the latest things with all thelawsuits around privacy and security soif you're not partnered with the rightpartners and obviously Google's got agreat story around this but if you'rewith some of the wrong Partners there'sa lot of risk and I'll tell you my owntrue story we've actually experimentedwith a lot of AI tools and marketingeveryone kind of experiments with a lotof writing tools right it's even evenbefore generative AI there's privateones we actually looked at everyone outthere none of them passed a securitytest not oneand then later on they started passingit we ended up leveraging one of theseso that's just an example is that yourpeople are going to be submittinginformation across these differentplatforms across different apis and ifyou have a really strong security teamyou need your own policies around thisbut just be prepared if you don't haveyour policy or people are going to do itregardlessand then does it scale for you so scalefor US is not just about from adeveloper perspective can a scale forbusiness users can they take actionswithout you one of the things that Danshowed with call purpose is a businessuser can configure those different typesof call purposes or it doesn't scaleonly with developers only with certainresources and if you're a smallerbusiness you might not be able to affordthat the biggest Enterprise which someof you are here today that's not anissue but if you're a mid-market companyif you have other AI projects thisreally becomes a challenge so understandthat project roadmap and if you mappedout all your AI projects you're going tofind out it actually doesn't Scale basedoff your resources everyone's going tostart to compete so get you know whetheryou do an offsite together but how youactually want to map that out it's goingto be really criticaluh in continuous learning and adaptinghopefully you're testing hopefullyyou're getting insights hopefully you'relearning from a lot of the mistakesyou've made hopefully you're determiningactually what your users are going touse what they're going to adopt andwhat's not valuable for them but we'regoing through this endlessly witheverything we do and actually that's oneof the advantages of our data set is wecan learn from ourselves you know kindof eating in our dog food eating our owndog food if you will and then futureproof whether it's dial pad whether youknow obviously we're all here we've beton Google as well you really need to buyfor what the product is today and youneed to partner can they developfeatures as fast as you need and thetruth is most of them can't and it's nofault of any company they're just somany different priorities and is thataligned with actually your vision andyour specific roadmap so we actually areworking with some analysts on thisthere's a couple really heavyweight onesthat are here that are giving moredetails to this and then hopefully ifyou're here we'll get that to you but wewant this to be a Playbook that all ofyou can actually take advantage of andget it to your co-workers and peers butthis is across the board across what allexecutives are talking about so kind ofclosing this out we talked a little bitabout how AI how it works for sales weobviously a lot of us are here thinkingabout specific sales centers we know onthe service side we think about how doesit work for your specific support teamsBut ultimately you know when we thinkabout the big picture of things just onemoreand it's stuck heredoes it work for your specific teamsright every specific team is going toeventually interface with a lot of yourdecisions out there I'm so impressedwith all the Pioneers we've had a lot ofopportunities to talk to folks but youare the Pioneers you are the folks thatare going to determine not just yourdepartments but the future of thecompany you have more education thanmost people out there on the planet ifyou're in this room or if you'reactually at this event so a hugeopportunity for all of us and with thatforeign"
