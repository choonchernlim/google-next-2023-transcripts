greatspeakers here um for an interestingpanel now um during our time togetherwe'll dive a bit deeper into Frontlineworkers discuss the Frameworks um thatwe see being successful um kind of whatthe learning have have been and um howto address some of these complexproblems that we see with Frontlineworkers who really are at the heart ofmany manybusinesses uh just on the logistics uhwe'll leave some time at the end for Q&Aso um uh you'll see some microphonesdotted around the room so um please uhask your questions at the endand um of course the session just likeall the other sessions is being recordedand will be made available on demand soonce you've seen just how fantastic andexciting the session is please sharewith your colleagues so they can also umsee uh and learn from thesession so uh I'm myself um I'm Frankwiel I'm uh GM here at Google and I'mvery excited uh to have uh with me uhmacarina herandezand uh um Alan Miller um and so whydon't you go and introduce yourselves alittle bit course wellhello I'm marara I'm from Mexico I'm inthe CTO of akran akan is a Energycompany in Mexico ER and we have morethan five business units along the oil ooil and gas value chain H and we haveoperations in Mexico and the states andalso presence in more than 10 LatinAmerican countries and we have around800 employees and 40% of them areFrontline workers wow and what is yourrole at Arron well my role is the C CTOof Acron but my job is to generateInnovation and intelligence ER throughthe use of Technology awesome that's agreat job and we'll hear later just someof the amazing results that marara hasdriven uh through that road um rolereally exciting Alanyeah absolutely Alan Miller I'm abusiness development leader with 66degrees we're one of the sponsors hereat next uh I also have a background as aworkspace deployment engineer uh 66degrees we're a Google focused uhpartner Services partner we provide uhcollaboration and uh productivityenablement for customers in NorthAmerica primarily although we have aninternational engineering presence uh wework with about a thousand a thousandworkspace clients specifically and thoseare across a broad spectrum of uhIndustries as as well as size so Fortune100 to founder L startups umindustry-wise I think relevant totoday's discussion we do have aconcentration of customers that are inuh Health Care uh financial services andManufacturing and we T it earlier andyou explained to me like where the name66 degrees come from I I it's veryfascinating so would you mind just justtelling the audience yes so perhaps inFahrenheit 66\u00b0 is the temperature rangein which clouds can form in nature andthat's from negative to positive that'sthe 66 degrees excellent I love itthat's one of the most clever companynames I think I've heard in a while umso before we jump kind of into the corediscussion about uh what both of youhave done and how you have helped theFrontline worker um transform digitallyI just want to take a couple of momentsand actually talk about what are theproblems that Frontline workerstypically um um have to endure often andso we're seeing that there are is aweird disconnect because for many manybusinesses Frontline workers isliterally the primary way how customersare interacting with the business rightum and um uh as a result Frontlineworkers are incredibly important to theperception of a company at the same timewe see that a lot of them are very umdisenfranchised we see a lot of turnovertypically which presents of course bigchallenges when it comes uh to trainingfor example um there is a a a lack of umuh inclusion often of like how they'reconnected to the system and lack ofaccess to certain technology and so as aresult we have this kind of this Chasmthis Gap where Frontline workers on onehand side are incredibly crucial andimportant uh for the experience ofcustomers yet they is a lot of gaps inthe technology they have access to andthe experience that they have um and Ithink today we'll hear a lot about um uhwhat approaches um both 66 degrees aswell as Acron have taken in order toovercome those challenges and um seejust how effective that has been so withthat said why don't we kind of um divein and and start with you know for yourfor Acron Macarena what uh what is yourFrontline worker what type of workFrontline Workforce do you have yes wellI think it will be very helpful to havea little bit of context so Aron it's avery traditional company in a verytraditional industry and in a verytraditional country so like Tech is noteverywhere like here you know so and inthis type of manufacturing facilities isreally rare and the people working therethey are not used to H like to usetechnology in not even in the work ornot in in their houses so yeah like wehave a lot of Frontline workers fromdrivers to cleaning people but like themain groups are two the first one is thepeople that is working in themanufacturing facilities ER and they arenot allowed to use H Tech tools duringtheir work because they are like need tobe concentrated in the production it's asaf yeah for us it's like why they willneeds some like Tech Tool you know butyeah now I'm I'm going to tell aboutabout it because they were disconnectedfrom everything like communication andyeah they feel excluded and the othergroup are their sales reps so it'speople selling H our products that arelubricants additives oil door too toautoshops gas stations and any Smallindustry that use these kind of productsfor their engines ER yeah so they werealways in the street with a cell phonefrom the company but like with you knowlike these H emails with differentdomain from the corporate ones H so theyalso feel excluded and they also need towait to go back to the office in orderto check their emails or the informationthey don't have like real time Tools intheir cell phones so these are our twomain groups in in in ACwhat was kind of the kind of businessprocess I think uh like you youmentioned to me like uh if a seller inthe field needed to get a discount howdid that work well they they used to gowith the client and the client ask forthe discount so they go back to theoffice with their bus and they sign thepaper and then deliver the product andwell they developed this H processthrough Gmail with where where the Bschool like approve the discount likewhen while there are in the field so itit has like it reduced the the cycletime of the sale like by50% all of this and it was like a smallchange you know yes yeah it's I thinkfor me this is always one of the veryfascinating things and I think we'llhear this from alen as well just howcommon paper processes still are youknow many of us in this room you knowmight think paper process that's reallylike not happening anymore but it'sincredible it's it's the literally thephysical paper processes we hear a lotin like manufacturing facilities andthings right where like a clipboard isstill being used all the way to whatpersonally I always consider the digitalpaper process which is you know youstill have the piece of paper it's justan email now but it's not really part ofa of a digital tized process that can bemonitored and optimized instead it'sjust people sending email and somebodyforgets if they needed to respond toapprove and things just fall throughjust like they did with a piece of paperum uh let's seeso both of you uh task with uh with youknow very complex problems we justtalked about uh some of these and theyFrontline workers often have this verybroad range ofresponsibility um so you're both tryingto solve for technology needs butthere's more beyond that as well and yousee large variety of course both ofroles as we heard as well as I mean lotsof people are very different and havedifferent amounts of exposure totechnology and so on um when you workthrough complex problem such as this youknow what do you what are you lookingfor in in technology um and so I thinkAlan why don't you um uh tell us alittle bit about that yeah so many ofthe pain points that marar had justdescribed are things we hear from ourclients with a heavy Frontline Workforceum if I generalize a few of those themesthat we most frequently hear here it's adesire to enhance communication betweendepartments uh increased visibility todata uh wanting to automate or digitizea paper process usually a paper processuh or improving user experience andthat's not just the internal users butalso the in customers experience as welluh an example that that comes to mindfor me around a paper based process isuh we had a a healthc Care customer uhwho wanted to digitize essentially theirintake process everything they did wasoriented around a pen and paper and thenat the end of the day somebody isputting that into a database that ofcourse is is not mobile friendly rightum so we in conjunction with Googleworkspace we also introduced an appsheet as part of the technology solutionto that problem now app sheetspecifically allowed us to introducero-based access controls uh automatedmonthly reports and have a mobileapplication that's not tied to a desktopuh the user experience or the thesolution uh created an experience thatwas was not just a good user experiencefor the intake specialist um but it wasalso reducing the check-in time as folkswould come into the office so ultimatelyit's improving that customer experienceas well that's a great example by theway those who unfamiliar app sheet is uhuh Google um low code no code tools soit's a way for um people who are let nottechnical but know the process to easilybuildt apps and actually I think you seehere on the on the screen uh you see Iguess those were some of the apps thatyou've built for your customers yes yesit was and um and to your point I meanapp sheet is is great for fostering aculture of Citizen development um and itdoesn't require the knowledge to write asingle line of code right it hooks up uhnatively to a lot of different datasources whether that's Google SheetsExcel MySQL um Salesforce data or it hasits own or it has its own database and Ithink if more abstract thing I see a lotof value in app sheet uh as a product isthat it it really Accel accelerates thetime to Value against a traditionalapplication development life cycle um soyou're not focused on Frameworks orlanguages you're focused on the businessconcept and that business concept whoknows that business concept better thanthe people who are in in the line ofbusiness right um a lot of times thatmight necessarily not be core italthough they can support it um sothat's uh that's and I think app sheet 2there was an exciting announcement a fewweeks ago that it was actually rolledinto to most of the workspace that'sright we just announced that it will beuh uh part of uh all the the paidworkspace cues so from that side an easyway for everybody to kind of try it outand get experience yepexcellent um and that was actually wasthe same thing I think you used as wellfor some of the solutions do I rememberthat right yeah yeah we we we use it butI think like before talking about thetools I think it's very important likefor us ER to find a simple technologywas key because all our strategy erhit's about the people so human arecomplex and also the culturaltransformation is very complex so wewere looking into very simple tools thatallow us to do all this transition EReasier because it has been verychallenging but ER yeah so a we decideto go from not Tech tools at all forthis group of people H to this simpleone it wasn't easy because my team mytechnological team was a verytraditional one and they were very usedto work with other tools that for mewere very complex so I said like imagineif no one H has used anything and thenyou put something very complex so itwill be a nightmare so we decide tochoose Google workspace because of theSimplicity of that and all theconnection that that their tools have soyeah we like provide the tools to thepeople andalso the team was convinced after onemonth or of trial because they tried toconvince me before to like and I saycome on like this is very complex it'sthere are good H tools but there arevery complex that we need something verysimple to generate this change so yeahmy team was convinced and then one ofthe like the leader of the manufacturingfacilities work with the people in thefloor in the product C floor and theydevelop all the quality process theytransition from paper to up sheet sothey have reduced like I think it's25,000 paper sheets per month and 10hours less per month doing this processby hand so yeah they it's working inlike one product line and we want toexpand to other product that's awesomelines but yeah like I think for us it'skey that like it needs to be simplebecause everything else is very complexyes I think it's especially withFrontline workers um Simplicity becauseof high turnover and other things andreally being able as you said um beingable to actually have the experts thepeople who do the process who oftenaren't necessarily very technical beingpart of creating the apps I think issomething that that we've heard a lot ofsuccess with because um ultimately thepeople who do a process are the ones whoknow best what to change about it makeit more effective moreefficient um so we talked about some ofthe main problems that you know you havebeen trying and actually solving notjust trying to solve like um let's be todiscuss the solutions a little bit moreand around what you've learned and whatthe Frameworks and best practices arethat you've kind of um found so um Marlet's kind of continue with you how wereyou able to now so you had decided onthe the tool you started to have thesolution but as you talked there's thepeople and changing people's behavior isnot an easy thing at all right so howwere you able to get that mass adoptionum at Acron and uh you know as you gowent and switched to Google workspaceand started rolling this out togetherwith app sheet yeah well I think the thetechnical part was the easy one and thenwe designed a campaign that it's calleddigital incl tionand yeah like we realized that in orderto generate digital skills it needs tobe in person so we visit all or ourfacilities in person to talk about athis change and also to like reinforceour support with the people and answerany question and and be there and likemake make sure that they were like usingthe tools you know because they feel athey were feeling very excluded and thiswas like an statement to go there andhelp them and show the tools to becomedigital but to connect with them so wewant to bring them closer to the like acompany headheadquarters through these tools but weneed to be there in person so this onewe call this a Google day so we visitevery place and we want to do it againandand also um for all this culturaltransformation we H we have been talkingabout the success stories that we haveso we invite a champion that has beenusing the tools very good and to presenta these cases in front ofeveryone and they explain how to do itand and also we have an an anotherinitiative that it's called did you knowif did you know that in Google and wepresent somefeature and add to this feature like avideo to H helping people ER learn howto use it oh that that's such a greatapproach how was what was the reactionyou know for both and did you notice anydifference in between the sellers rightand the the manufacturing workers whatwas their General like uh well responseto all of this yeah I think that it itwas a they were they were very Sursurprised when they see us like there intheir facilities and and also they theywere really excited to participate inthese activities and we had a a previousprogram that was only for theadministrative people that is calledideas lab and and we expand this programto the ER factories and now they are theone that are participating the more inthese kind of ideas like to changeprocesses so and also the the sales repsare very H ER participating in this kindof tool so it has been incredible that'sgreat to see that kind of empowermentthat just comes from being able toparticipate in ways that previouslywasn't really possible so digitaltransformation I think one of the finestexamples of how we can do that now um Alclearly you know you uh as an SI uh youdon't have Frontline workers so muchyourself so you work with a broad rangeof companies um what Guidance Do youhave for those organizations kind of asyou engage um as they want to modernizetheir Frontline Workforce you know howdoes it compare to what Arron does andwhat are some things that that you aredoing yeah so I I think uh we can drawoff a lot of what marar said here andthat there's really two components wesee in uh in projects and that's thepeople in the tech and both of those andmerging those successfully is reallygoing to be the the key to to an overallsuccessful project um on the partnerfront we want to be able to consult onthe tools and tactics that are going tosupport the company as they move throughand create things like Google days anddo trainings and and make sure they'reenabling the team um but that executivesupport the executive Champion isabsolutely critical like when I hear saylike her mandate is driving change andInnovation that is that's reallyimportant it's music to our ears to hearthat um because we're not going to havethe the pulse on the the an insight intothe culture as a third part that they'regoing to have internally um so th thosetwo things are really important I thinkas far as the framework goes we followwhat's called an Adar model um and thatis awareness desire knowledge abilityand reinforcement I believe it's also aframework that that Google leverages aswell um so we found that to be verysuccessful to click into a couple ofthose um the second one desire I thinkthat's a really important piece on thejourney to be able to uh help theFrontline Workforce understandunderstand why the modernization ishappening get them excited about it thisis going to help you do your job moreeffectively you're going to reduce someof the time you're spending doing manualtasks and ultimately serve the customersbetter right and that message is reallyimportant and then at the end I think uhthe r the reinforcement um it is reallyimportant to have positive reinforcementespecially within the champion networkuh that you create um so you want it tothat what You' have rolled out tosustain and I think the positivereinforcement celebration um of uh ofthat process is really importantthroughout that framework uh a couple ofcommonalities that are weaved throughoutis a Clear Vision and strategy and thatties back to the executive team that isdriving that Clear Vision strategy downthis is how it ties to our operatingplan here are here are the benefits ofthis modernization um early employeeinvolvement effective communication andthen creating that champion Network umso you want to have folks that are notjust part of the technical team uh butthe business users that are supportingtheir their colleagues throughout the uhthroughout the modernization effort soyou're saying those Champions arebasically part of that front line theirFrontline workers themselves who kind ofget extra excited and maybe have donesome of the um apps that have beendeployed so that it kind of comes fromwithin that Community itself yepabsolutely and and I think um you knowin here in some of the the activitiesthat they put forth I mean we've seen uha customer do uh they actually hosted aconcert internally and then announcedthey were modernized and going Google atthe concert um the digital assets thatyou have you know throughout some of thekey locations in office or in certainfacilities that are giving people thetimeline communication what to expectjust constantly re constantly educatingon what to expect um those things areall all very important awesome nowum when it comes to the I mean I thinkwe talked a little bit about what um uhthe concrete things and umI now was curious to see what about thesuccess right so we talked about howyou've um uh rolled out digitaltransformation um what were some of theoutcomes right after all right for a lotof businesses in the end we we start atthe beginning we have certain problemsright where Frontline workers uh oftenum go and have a much higher turn ratewhere they aren't as engaged where theyaren't as effective so what were someoutcomes that came came out of thetransformation that you'vedriven yeah well from from the beginningwe knew that transitioning to Googlewill give us more collaboration andsimplicity so we think that we we werebecoming more effective H so we startmeasuring savings to and for example thethe quality process that I told you likewe save a lot of time and paper and wecan convert that to money H but thenwith the the sales reps we decide to gofurther and check if a h like what whatwe happening now and we realized thatfrom the day that we transition toGoogle today h it has the sales hasincreased 25% wow but also the turnoverhas decreased 40% and I think likesometimes it's very difficult to relatethese business metrics directly with theadoption or a of a technological toolbut I don't think that it's only acoincidence well especially I think theI mean the way you describe just how thelife of a seller becomes a lot lessfrustrating and more effective now beingable to get the approval through Gmailand so on I can totally see how how thatmust have been a big part of it that'sexcellent and also like a before we gavethese people like a different email fromthe corporate one you know and it waslike they weren't identified with us Hbecause because they were they they havea high turn turnover so for us is whyare us like spending money in thesepeople if they are like going back andforth ER but it was because of that youknow so like the problem was there yeahso yeah like they are still like theturnover is decreasing so it it is verygood and also we realize that like thefront line license is not the best onefor them we need to give them a betterone because they are the ones using allthe time their mobile phone and theyneed that information in their hands soyeah that that was like we we learnedthat that yeah they need a better abetter one because they are the only theones using this information in thestreets and you can think that one inthe computer it's going to use morefeatures but that is not true like thepeople selling in the street is the onelike are really using the tool so yeahthey are becoming more than a front linelicense yeah and I think earlier youcalled it digital inclusion and it seemslike really that that kind of approachhas has driven a lot of um uh not justoutcome but just like a sense of ofbelonging and more empowerment which isreally really great to see very excitingum what about um for 66 degrees like umany results that you've seen at yourclients that uh you can share I thinkwhat was just highlighted in uhsomething that's quantifiable andtangible outcomes that you're measuringso cost savings productivity efficiencyum Employee Engagement uh absolutely umand then I think one that I would add tothat is sustainability uh when you'reimplementing or you're modernizingtechnology or implementing something newwhat's going to happen in 3 to fiveyears when your business needs change ortechnology evolves have you laid afoundation uh that you are able tocontinue to evolve with it right um so Ithink but I think otherwise the the methe themetrics that was shared those areperfect yeah no I think that's a that'sa great point I mean with digitaltransformation comes the ability to bemore agile and the world is changingvery fast so I think uh that inherentability to then evolve process is muchfaster than traditional I think it's acrey thing and it's there do you haveany any approach to try and measure orquantify that agility or um is it stillsomething that's business to businessdifferent I think that's business tobusiness and how to quantify the agilitythere yescool say so um we're almost at the Q&Auh I just um wanted to ask both of youyou know having been successful atdriving that digital transformation withFrontline worker um kind of what uh is apiece of advice that you would like togive to everybody in the audience oreverybody who's seen this recordinglater um what would you what what wouldyour advice be for them as they'retrying to modernize their FrontlineWorkforce well I think that giving voiceto your people will S surprise you youknow everyone is capable to create newideas innovate they only need tools andguidance so I think like they arewaiting for an opportunity and if if weas Leaders give them these tools andguidance H they are going to make magicwith them so so that is my advice Sageadvice thank you um yeah so so Icouldn't agree more with that I thinkit's important to to give uh your peoplea voice and give them the right tools tosucceed um one thing that I was I wasthinking about is since the last time wewere all here a few years ago there aresome new terms that have emerged rightterms I hadn't heard before like thegreat resignation quiet quitting uhoveremployment um and and I think whiletraditionally you would tie those toknowledge workers I think what is doneis pull back the covers on really theupstream and downstream effects ofemployees beingdisenfranchised um and so giving them avoice you know giving your them a voicein the process being able to enhancetheir own workflows using tools like appsheet I think it have a positive impactuh not just internally But ultimately onon the customers that they're servingawesome excellent that was uh Sageadvice um really great to have you onhere he"
