and also hear from ourcustomersall right as you've seen over the pastfew months Google is taking a bold andresponsible approach to working with ourcustomers on creating innovativesolutions to some of their biggestchallengesthis Innovation mindset is not new forGoogleour mission well publicized is toorganize the world's information makingit universally accessible and usefulumGoogle has products oh sorry no soundGoogle has products which individuallyserve billions of customersdelivering products at the scale hasrequired Google to build the world'sleading AI research organization andinvent technology to manage and use dataat petabyte scalewhether we're finding novel ways toidentify fraudsters on Google paydesigning customer AI chipsto run AI workloads at massive scale orPioneer industry-leading approaches todeliver AI in an explainable safe andresponsible manner Google solves thesekinds of problems every single daymy team has specifically been using thevery best of this technology in closepartnership with our customers to bringAI powered Innovation to financialservices and help solve some of theirbiggest challenges and demonstrate howcompanies can use AI for goodback in June we announced the launch ofour new anti-money laundering AI productit is designed to help financialinstitutions detect money launderingmore effectively and efficientlythis product is a combination ofmultiple years of working in closecollaboration with our strategiccustomers like HSBC and verdescothis product has already been adopted asa system of record for money launderingdetection in region spanning EuropeCentral America and Asia Pacificwe are so excited to share the resultswe've achieved with our AI only approachbased on the last year of productionused at HSBC versus the previousrule-based approachesour product is able to detect two tofour times more suspicious activitywhile reducing the overall alert volumeby over 60 percentat the outset we aim to improve thesetwo metricswe learned after our initial deploymentthat this also helped improve customerexperience which was delightful whathappened was the request for informationfrom customers also improved by over 60percentso in our time today I will give anoverview of the product and then we willhear from two of our customers Rich Mayfrom HSBC and Rafael cavalcanti fromBanco perdasco who will share theirperspectives on working with us totransform their anti-money launderingcompliance programsbut first let's spend a few minutes onthe impact of money laundering on theworld and why Google has chosen to focuson this problemso it's well known that technologicaladvancements have made the world a lotmore interconnected the scale andcomplexity of the global GlobalFinancial Networkhas grown dramaticallywhile these advances have provided manybenefits to customers they have alsoopened up new avenues for Bad actors tocommit Financial crimethe UN estimates an eye-watering numberwhich is more than two percent of theglobal GDP is laundered every singleyearand of course these proceeds areconnected to illegal activity such asdrug and human trafficking and terroristfinancingcombating this problem is of course veryvery hard and our customers spend asignificant amount of resource on theiranti-money laundering complianceprogramsand a big part of the challenge comesdown to the data and the technologyavailablewith trillions of transactions nowflowing through the financial sector ourcustomers are left to make sense of ahuge amount of informationso essentially the complexity of theproblem has now exceeded the ability ofcurrent methods to address themover the course of us developing thisproduct we heard some of the challengesour customers facewe've heard that incumbent Solutionsrely on manually defined business rulesand those systems generate too manyfalse positiveswe've heard also that The Silo datamake it hard to find the right signalwhich adds time and complexity tocombating the problem we've also heardthat analyst workflows are tedious andinefficient which leads to high staffturnoverso why is the industry still using thesemethodsbecause good Ai and regulated industryis hardour customers have previously told triedto deploy AI as a primary means of moneylaundering detection and alerting butthis is rarely made it out of the proofof concept stagethey have faced significant challengesin explaining their models to internalaudit groups and to regulators andgaining confidence of risk coverage onan AI only approach has proven elusiveuntil this moment so what have we builtwe have built a product which usesmachine learning to detect potentialmoney laundering using a holistic viewof a customer's datawe do so in an explainable way for bothanalysts Risk Managers and regulatorswe provide robust model governance sothat it is easier to adopt this productwe have made sure this product isflexible so that the customers can coverthe risks that they prioritizeand all of this is of course deployed tothe customer's own isolated environmentmeaning their data never leaves theirenvironment and it is governed by theirown encryption keyswe know that the AML kyc program coversa broad range of mission critical areasit ranges from customer onboarding tosanction screening to of course ongoingrisk monitoring including AML fraud andscamsum I wanted to make sure that it isunderstood that our product currentfocus is on providing a more effectiveand efficient way to perform transactionmonitoring and ongoing monitoring ofcustomers for money laundering detectionso what does the product look like inthe customer's environment so ourproduct is an API and it is designed tobe easily dropped in and seamlesslyintegrated into your existing anti-moneylaundering ecosystemthe API automaticallytrains a model which usesa holistic view of customer data we usedata such as transactions accounts kycdata as well as any additional data thecustomer may choose to incorporatewe combine that data with previous riskevents such as identified suspiciousactivityand then we automatically create aholistic risk score and explainabilityall of which feed into your existingCase Management Systems where theanalysts can review and investigate onlythe high risk alertsthose analyst actions provide thefeedback loop that ensures our productcan adapt to changing data patterns overtimewe offer as I mentioned very richexplainabilitywe want to make sure that our customersunderstand what specific risk indicatorscontributed to the scoreso on the screen we have an examplein this case rapid movement of funds wasthe predominant factor that contributedto the overall scoreexplainability such as this is used inthree different ways it's used by theanalysts so they know what toinvestigatewhen they see an alertit's used by Risk Managers to determinewhich risks are effectively coveredand it's used by model governance tounderstand how the product is operatingmodel governance we've learned can takeover a year in a financial institutionto get from proof of concept toproduction deployment and it can take ayear because of the rigor andjustification and validation of theapproach readily required by Financialregulatory bodiesand internal governance boards so out ofthe box we offer robust model and riskgovernance based on both our ownresponsible AI principles as well as thefinancial regulatory requirementsthis includes documentation of Conceptsand methodologythat we use to construct the productalso the metadata that is coming out ofour API which explains how thoseConcepts have been appliedone of the additional challenges inadopting machine learning in productionis gaining confidence to actually goliveand so with the apis that are simple tointegratewith a flexible data schema andcustomizable risk typologies we aim tomake that process a lot easierour product uses uses a data-drivenapproachso that you can help so you can buildyour case for adoptionthis data-driven approach has threeelements the first is of coursemeasuring the risk coverage the systemprovides based on your typologiesthe second is measuring theeffectiveness of how much moresuspicious activity you're able todetectand the third is how much more effectiveare you making the overall process withthese three data points we see ourcustomers really gain confidence andmake the case first for themselves andthen for all of their stakeholders toreally go go live and make the case foradoptionso with thatI would first love to offer mycongratulations to our to the HSBC teamwho's been our pioneering partnertheir work in transforming their AMLprogram resulting in them beingnamed the sell and modelers manager ofthe yearmlai is at the heart of theirtransformation and we are very honoredto have two customers here with us todayI will introduce them so we have Rafaelcavalcanti Rafael is the senior vicepresident of data and analytics andBanco brodescoRafael leads a team of 350 datascientists and Engineers on projectsacross multiple business units andfunctions and by mobilizing theorganization with a data-driven mindsetRaphael has generated value acrossefficiency and cutting-edge customerexperience resulting in huge p l gainswelcome thank you Richard may pleasewelcome to the stage is the group headof financial crimefor commercial Global and Market bankingat HSBCa financial crime expert with over 25years of experience Richard previouslyserved in a variety of roles at the U.SDepartment of Treasury including Deputyassociate director for fincenenforcement Networkprior to joining the US Department ofTreasury reach also served in the U.Sarmy leading soldiers in Iraq andAfghanistan with the 82nd AirborneDivision welcome Bob thank you forjoining usokaythank you so much for joining us bothokayall right sofirst of all thank you so much for thepartnership we honestly couldn't haveasked for better partnersthe two of youI wanted toFirst mention that this was a journeyfor Google in terms of many firstsand your approach and and combating thisproblem in each of your individualinstitutions has been formative for usand how we thought about the product sothank you thank youokay so we'll start with Ridge Richbefore we dive into aml's transformativeAML journey I wanted toumtake a chance and and benefit from yourdeeper expertise in the subject and getyour perspective on what challenges doyou see facing the industry and TheRegulators today andum what what opportunities do you seefor a paradigm shiftso uh challenges we have tons ofchallenges in this space across theindustry but also at hsbc's um as Italked today about our journey thatwe've been on with Google throughoutthis the challenges that I'm going totalk about for industry are the samechallenges that we had to overcomeourselves the first is thatin the compliance space everyone that isin the compliance field has been dealingwith rule-based monitoring systems forthe last 25 30 35 years everyone in thecompliance space has grown up onrule-based systems it's in the DNA of acompliance officer they like thembecause I want to look for xsystem go look for ax you get a lot ofconfidence you you really feelcomfortable the system is doing what Itold it to do and therefore I know it'sdoing what needs to be doneso that is a challenge because ourRegulators our other institutionseveryone has grown up with that mindsetand it's very comfortable to have thatmindsetwhen you switch to AI an AML AI productlike this you have to flip that on itshead and now you're trying to convincepeople that have been doing the samething for 30 years of a different way todo it and to be honest the benefits weresomewhat theoretical AI hasn't beenaround that long so you have to takethis leap of faith that what you'reproposing is going to be a betteroutcome that you're going to find morefinancial crime that you're going to doit faster that you're going to do itwith more efficiency but that's notknown and so you get an entirepopulation of your Regulators otherindustry participants that look at yousomewhat skeptically the firstconversation we had was we're going tofind more financial crime we're going todo it faster and the first response youalways get is I don't quite believe youand so that's the number one challengethat we had across the entire industryand dealing with our Regulators on thisthe second is dataproduct works when you have the rightdata in the right place and that it'scleandata is the bane of my existencenone of our data was in the right placenone of it was properly cleaned so itwas a huge amount of effort forourselves as well as for anyone else inIndustry to get their data into theplace that it needs to be for it to beused properly by the productthe last thingthat I'd say all of the industry istrying to struggle with is justhow do you then stay on top of emergingFinancial crime risks is the systemadaptable enough to be able to learn andto grow as the risks change and so youneed a system that can be a livingbreathing manageable system in the lightof everything else so those are the thefirst three challenges that jump to mindthere's a thousand other ones we cantalk about model risk governance we cantalk about all that there's a millionchallenges but those are the top threeso much you can see how those factorswill drive innovation in this space in areally significant way Rafa turning toyouum what do you see as an opportunity forAI in combating financial crime and morebroadly to solve some high complexitychallenges and financial services soyeah I think historically data andmodeling have been a very key part inBrazilian Banks overall I think when thewhole Brazilian economy stabilize andcredit became something very criticalrule-based systems yeah right we're alimited part of our capability of ofoffering financial services to ourcustomers so it naturally evolved toadopting I would say models and AI alittle bit to incorporate the way thatwe Definethe level of credit limits and approvalrates so when it comes to the way that Ithink I said AI brings benefits tofinancial services there are three keythings the first one is efficiencyImprovement right so traditionally banksthat have been around for 80 years we dohave a large physical presence branchesand there is a lot of opportunity tothink about our engagement models withcustomers leveraging data to optimizeour operations from the front officeperspective including back officeperspective the second one is controlenhancements right I think naturally ourcapability of combining all the data allthe data that we have from customers indifferent channels provide us a clearunderstanding of what the customer isdoing and what the customer is trying topretend they're doing as well and Ithink the third one is the customerexperience itself right our ability tounderstand what's happening and as anatural result that you shared hereright once I I reduce the amount ofinformation I need to ask the customerand many times their customers do notunderstand why we're asking since theyprobably already provided usum we'll definitely get tremendousbenefits and I do think those are thekey moving things that I saw in themarket the first one is Regulatorsrequiring us to raise the bar in termsof controls soum in 2020 our Central Bank told us thatwe need to have a consistent internalmethod of evaluation that that wouldbring enough robust business to ourdecision process and again rule-basedsystems kind of have some limitations inorder to achieve that and the second oneis customer expectations itself rightthe the customers they they havereasoned the bar in terms of all thethings that uh they naturally use eitherof the extremely recommendation eitherI'm engaging with us through uh instantmessage app so those are the two thingsthat are really motivating Banks toleverage data and AI in our decisioningplatformso even with the model government iscomplexity right thethe adoption of AI and financialservices for sure because againthe kind of results that we see hereit's reducing complex in terms ofoperations and also being more efficientin terms of what we do so the appetiteis really moved by the financialbenefits it actually brings in the endof the day and those tangible Financialbenefits are also matched by theincrease of the experience of thecustomer so if I incorporate an AIrecommendation system that would providepersonalized experience in my digitalchannel I would definitely have moreengagement for the customer with myselfand as a result everything that I talkto him will make more sense and as aresult he would definitely accept theoffers that make sense that are suitablefor for him or for her thank youBridge turning to you yepum so you've spoken extensively on theopportunities that the industry has topartner with technology companies andLeverage The Best of Both Worlds can youtalk a little bit about how thispartnership came about what concernsmaybe you've had in the beginningworking with Google and how you've comearound potentially around these concernsand and where we ended upso we've been working with Google forabout five years now I joined about fouryears ago so after a year it's beenreally wonderful to work with Google asa partnership mainly because of how muchdevelopment it's brought for mepersonally so when I first got broughton board to be the HSBC side of thispartnership I didn't believe that AIwould bring the value and the benefitsthat it would I was skeptical I saw whatit was proposing and the numbersI I couldn't believe themand so I said to my boss I'm like whyare you sure about this I'm not reallysure that this is going to do whatpeople say it's going to do and my bossrightfully said great if they convinceyou then you can go convince everyoneelse so I came in very skeptically notsure that I believed everything that wasgoing to be there we've all had thosesituations where someone comes inpromising everything under the sun andthen you get 10 delivered and they kindofwasn't that greatwhat we have found through thispartnership is one we had to change ourthinking processwe knew what we wanted to do we had ourobjectives find more financial crimefaster and more efficientlythose were our objectivesthe problem that we had was we thoughtwe knew how to do thatand we had to strip that away and comein and say Here's what we're trying toachieve and work out how to do that withGoogle instead of us just coming toGoogle and what we want to do to achievethat is X Y and Z because what we foundwas X Y and Z the the steps that wethought we wanted to do were limited byhsbc's own kind of knowledge and thelens that we were looking at it throughwhere a lot of the stuff we're proposingI can't tell you how many times I heardGoogle people say why are you even doingthat that makes no sense it's much moreeffective just to do this and we justdidn't know and that's fine but for uswe had to take that step back strip downto what are we trying to achieveand then we were able to truly worktogether in a partnership and get thereand actually have a better productdelivered that I actually can standbehind that I believe and I see theresults those numbers up there the twoto four times more financial crime found60 reduction those are low estimatesthose are generally available numbersthat we can put out there the actualtrue numbers are better but I can't getas precise as I'd like to be in a publicdomain find out laterthank you uh you you both have beenincredibly generous with your expertisein the combating financial crime I thinkthat combination of Google's datascience prowess and expertise has beenamazingum all right Rafa how would you describeour collaboration so I have I haven'tseen this presentation before but Icould I could definitely say that myselfand the team we have lived thispresentation which I think is the mostimportant thing I think conceptuallyum we we had first one challengeum our data was not fully in GoogleCloud platform I was there our data wasresiding in some systems that wereeither on-prem or other Cloud so I thinkthis was the first challenge that Iwould say we had to face but again itwas I would say a fairly basic challengeto overcome becauseum there were some embedded expertise inGoogle's team in terms of what they havealready worked in other Banks and Ithink the SEC the Second Challenge alittle bit different from what we sharedis that we had a model that we developedin 2021 thatI I I was asked many times but isn't themodel that you made good enough said Idon't know I mean it's the first modelwe did and I don't have any specificbenchmark because the marketreally lacks Benchmark in terms ofaccuracy and precisions of models for MLright if it's a credit model we havebureaus that has historically developedmodels and we do have a benchmark so soeither from my from the bank perspectiveI had to put two very interestingpotential outcomes the first one isafter three months of collaborations wewould find out find out that the modeltechnically has the same accuracy thatwe have it's fine but even that is avery good outcome from from us right butI was definitely expecting that we weactually reached a significantImprovement in terms of performance Ithink it was not only our capability offinding Financial crime events but alsothe increase of capabilities of findinghigh risk Financial crime more rapidlythat I assume it is something very keyto what we do and and again it wasso the product here was actually thoughtas another product so it was not only aset of apis it was a set of apis thatwould make sense when you go toproduction it was not only a specificdata pattern that would have to followwas a data pattern that makes sensewithin the ml domain scope but also waswilling to be open so we could aggregatesome specific data that was relevant forus in the Brazilian Market from ourdisco's perspective so I just see thatcombining the flexibility and thequality of work many times in themeetings that we had I had a hard timeidentifying if the data scientists weresomebody from the bank or somebody fromGoogle which I think is a very goodfeedback because my team learned alittle bit on the way that Google woulddo engineering and perhaps Google teamalso learn a little bit of the landscapeof ml in Brazildefinitely I'm really excited to hearabout the flexibility part I would saywhen I was working at banking I wasreally focused on having a reallypowerful core capability and then beingable to extend it to make it fit my usecases so really focused on that I'mhappy to hear that it's not easy but wemanaged to do itso moving from Vision to productionreally takes confidencewhat were the metrics that you used togain that confidenceand initially both for yourself youmentioned that you started as a skepticand then how did you bring your peersalong how did you bring Regulators alongyeah so metrics right everyone has thosebenchmarks no truer words have ever beensaid than the banks Love A Benchmarkthat they can dress off of becausethat's absolutely right now we werefairly Lucky in that we were using ourstatic rule-based system as ourBenchmark whichwas industry average which is not greatindustry average is terrible ours isdefinitely industry average and prettygood for industry averagebut what we knew we wanted to do is findmore financial crime so we took theamount of financial crime that ourworld-based system was identify and welooked to see if this model whendeployed against our customer base wouldidentify more financial crime and so wedid a lot of testing and experiments tosee that did we actually identifysomething that the other system did notand we routinely and and every time didwe found more financial crime and sothat's really what ultimately became ourpath to success we took thosepre-existing standards and what we weredoing with our current system and wewere showing the promise and capabilityof the amlai productto our internal stakeholders to ourregulators and when you put the evidencein front of people it tells the storyfor you I didn't really have to go outand twist arms or convince or doanything the evidence was there weshowed how many times we were findingFinancial crime before how many alertshad false positives we showed what thismodel was producing as far as the amountof financial crime identified how feweralerts there were because those falsepositives had been ripped out and thestory tells itself and so I didn'treally have to go convince people I justhad to do the work to show and toproduce the evidence and then put theevidence in front of people and once youput that evidence in front of peopleit's hard to say why you would not adoptit and that's the way that we wouldroutinely put that to people that mayhave been a little bit more hesitant ofthis finds more financial crime it doesit more effectively it does it fasterwhy do I not turn this on and when youput it to them that way they don't havea good answer except well this isn'tjust not the way we've done it beforeokay we're gonna change because this isbetterdid you find that there was a need forparallel runs so adopted a different waythis was a rule for us no parallel runsum so in the compliance space everyonewants to talk about parallel runs so youhave your existing system on andproducing and you turn on your newsystem and you run them in parallel fora few months six months a year whateverit is we knew we didn't want that so wetook almost an approach of once theships landed on the shore we burned theships so we would do a day one fullswitch over we would do it we have avery good testing regime of how we gotcomfortable but then once we gotcomfortable we said we're not lookingback why would I keep running a systemthat's inefficient and not doing as wellas this other systemI am turning this on I don't needboth systems running so we're not goingto do that so parallel runs for useither you're confident that you want toswitch systems or you're not but youcan't have one footin both camps so if you actually believeyou're doing the right thing do theright thing boldly and that's what wedidsounds like a very thorough approach toget to the answer we had aslightly differentapproach because again internally ourwork was a collaboration between the mlteam and my teamso I think we realized that would berelevant to have a short parallel run inorder to make sure that people was extracomfortable in terms of the ml Escapebut again it was something veryparticular for our organization that Ithink at the end of the day like when wewe finished the parallel run and we tooka look at the results they had the samefeeling in terms of let's do itaccelerator so at least I tried toconvince them that parallel runs thatlast one year is actually because we'renot actually believing it so it shouldbe quick and fast as Rick said but againour organization understood that theywould need a little bit more time interms of the case analysis and that'sfine it took more time but again weachieved I think pretty good resultsrelatively speaking actually our proofof concept run really fast okay goodmaybe inside it's not like okaysay I'm pretty excited what we've beenable to accomplish yeah yeah sure it wasa Sprint parallel yeah I would say itdefinitely was so now that we'vecompleted a successful proof of valueand you've seen the results uh Rafa whatdo you think uh you're gonna need toclear the path to production so I thinknow it's basically doing the techIntegrations I think a little bit of thethe scenario that I mentioned regardingdata was not fully residing in gcp itwas something that during thedevelopment phase was fairly easy toovercome now we do have some structuralwork to do in the next couple of monthsbut I do see that we'll be deploying andusing it besides the parallel run by theend of the year hopefullyfor both of you actually so maybestarting with you with rafan and do yourich how are you thinking about thistransformation fromyes technology but also people inprocessor richso I thinkit is like three years ago when westarted the engagement with the AML teamit was really difficult because as Reedsaid everybody wasfully relying on specific rules and ittook us probably one year to understandwhat actually it meant a high riskregarding AML because since it'severything it's based on rules and thoserules get fairly complicated in order toemulate the realityit is not very easy to document andsometimes it's not very consistent andit does incorporate a lot of subjectivewhen executing because even though it isfairly simple to translate like like therules that I'm speaking here to actualrules in the systemsmany times it doesn't reflect and wewere discussing with uh some EMLSpecialists they would say but in thisspecific case I need to a b c and d soit has a great amount of time tounderstand how data analytics couldactually bring value and I do think thatit is part of the data analytics teampurpose to work along with business inthis case I'm considering AML guys apart of business right running risk as abusinessto make sure we understand each otherand again they are the experts we arethe ones bringing some some technicalstuff that would make their work betterso I just I just I do think that havinginternally a team that could navigateunderstanding the data and the businessprocess was very key when we went alongwith you guys to have the samediscussion so I do think this was a verykey point for our success thank you Richhave you had to change anything aroundpeople in the process and obviously thetech you've changed absolutely we've hadto change quite a bitum so on your PowerPoint presentationthere's a question about risk coverageon there so risk coverage which Iactually find very interesting but andprobably the only one in this entirebuilding that does risk coverage is verysimple you have a risk ofshell companies you have a risk ofhigh-risk geographies you have theserisks and all of those risks in arule-based system are tracked to aspecific scenario or a series ofscenariosit's very easy to say I have these risksand those risks are covered because Ihave these scenarios running with theamlai product you don't have thatso you actually have to flip it to theoutput and look at the output of theproduct and ask yourself is the productidentifying those risks in the way thatyou would expect and so you're able toactually say I do have risk coverage notbecause I told the system what to do butbecause I see the output of the productshowing that those risks are gettingdetected and that's just one example ofa whole bunch of ways of how do youmanage and govern a monitoring systemlike this in a bank working at scale andso you have to find all those placeswhere people are taking a comfortableReliance that if I told a system to do Xand it does it routinely then that'sgood enoughand you have to figure out how are theygoing to actually do that in the newmodelthat's one the second part areinvestigators ultimately the output ofthe product goes to an investigatorwho's going to look at that can theyunderstand why that case is landing attheir feet so we had to do a lot of workwith our partners to make sure that thatexplainability was clear enough that aninvestigator could pick up that case andfigure out why is this coming to me andthen work through it as quickly aspossible to get to the right outcome andthat meant that we had to change some ofour internal pipes and architecture tomake sure that we are providing themwith all the explainability informationand data up front so that way they couldcome to that conclusion as quickly aspossiblethose are the two most fundamentalpeople things that we changed but thenthe last is just the hearts and minds ofconvincing people why AI is not somescary thing people talk about it likeit's I don't know something that theycan't even wrap their head around we hadto do quite a few classes and teach-insto teach people what AI machine learningactually means in the bank's context andhow we were deploying against thisproblemspending that time up front teachingthem and then helping work through howthey're going to do their day job andmeet their accountabilities ultimatelygot them more comfortable but boy thatwas a lot of work we're still doing itit's still a lot of work it's not donethank you all right turning ourselves tothe Futureum what do you both see as theopportunities for AI and combatingfinancial crime it feels to me likewe're at the start I don't know if youshare the view maybe Rich start with youandum I absolutely think that we're at thestart um I have a friend who justretired and what I'm about to say willgive you an indication of his age isthat he's been in compliance for a fewdecades and he was around when we wentfrom manual human reviewof transactions to identify suspiciousactivity to win computersstarted to get brought in and he alwaysloves to tell the story about how hewent to the regulator and said we'reactually going to start using computersto monitor transactions for customersand The Regulators say that well how canyou be comfortable that that computer isgoing to do as well as your human checkswithin five yearsThe Regulators had switched from how areyou comfortable to why aren't you usingcomputers for your transactionmonitoring we're at the same kind ofinflection point right now the questionswe're getting from Regulators to datehave been how have you gottencomfortable that using this AI basedmodel is going to be effective for youin the next five years the question isgoing to flip to the other Banks to saywhy are you not using AI it's shown thatit's effective you have the capabilitywhy are you not adopting somethingthat's going to be better that's goingto find more financial crime and so Ithink over the next five years that'swhat I expect to see additional usecases that are now being driven by thebusiness because they see the value inwhat's getting produced here out of thisproduct but then The Regulators I expectwill probably flip a little bit and sayokay we don't have as many questionsabout AI why aren't you using AI what'syour reason for not adopting it and Ithink that's where we're goingokay I would add to read scenario I Iwould say that we do have here aframework that would provide us theprobability of a high-risk customerexplainability and and we do have thewhole empowerment of the investigatorleveraging him with more data I do thinkthat generative AI may play a big partof that because it helps get a lot ofdomain specific knowledge and many timeswe're talking about a specific companythat works in a specific Market in aspecific context and we do have we dohave still a lot of manual processes interms of report generation that coulddefinitely be leveraged combining Iwould say the the co-pilot aspect ofwhat we have that is basicallyleveraging good consistent statisticalmodels with a lot of accelerationregarding summarization and and crawlingthe internet with a good dataall right thank you I am[Music]couldn't have asked for better Partnersthank you so much and thank you everyonefor joining us[Applause]foreign"
