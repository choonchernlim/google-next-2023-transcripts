spendtime with usand with that my name is Rohit Puri andwith me I have srinath padmanabun todayand we are both part of the Google Cloudplatform team at Google and I'd like tointroduce yourself first thanks Rohitthanks everyone for joining us todayhopefully you find this session usefuland we will of course stay on for anyquestions you have after the session myname is srinath I'm a product managerhere at Google cloud and I've been atGoogle Cloud for just under six yearssix years next month and uh so I startedoff my career as a developer writing CCplus plus code more than 15 years agoand then it's been a long while so Icame full circle and I said okay I wantto start building tools that helpdevelopers be more efficient and gofaster and so that's a little bit aboutme and where I am today I work in thedevtools.org and help build tools tohelp developers go faster awesome thankyou so I'm going to date myself heregiven what she and I just talked aboutI've been in this space for about 25plus years online engineering PM thebias Marketing sales done the wholeshebangum and I had an epiphany about a coupleweeks back when I was talking to srinathwhen I started my career 25 years backthe technology was the most interestingplace to be but there were theseconversations around me about studentloan paying for college kids going tocollege and I had no interest in them 25years later I am those people nowbecause I have kids going to collegetechnology and they're all ramping up aswell right with that in mind a quickshow of hands how many here have workedwith a cloud platform in developmentand keep your hand up if that's been gcpGoogle Cloud platformvery cool exciting so with the changesin the technology landscape I'm sure theaudience here has been through that aswell in the last say 20 years the changeof pace the pace of change in technologyhas been fast and it's only gone fasterright with that businesses peopleorganizations all need to keep up tospeed with that technology to make thebest use of it it is exciting butsometimes can get challenging as wellwith that in mind today's 45 minutes isfocused on you saw the Innovations todayat our keynote on cloud and AI right inparallel is how do I ramp up keep up tospeed and make the best use of thistechnology in a quick fast way so wespend a few minutes talking about theintroduction and overview of what we'llcover we'll go through the learningcycle and what it takes from adeveloper's perspective to sort of be upto speed and take the burst out of thetechnology uh shinati will do awalkthrough of all the things thatGoogle has invested in to make it easierfor people to adopt the technology getup to speed and learn about it and we'llend the day with pointers to someHands-On areas that we found useful andwe are investing in to make it easierfor you to learn and get started withthe Google cloud and AI Technologiesright with that in mindif you look at the cloud and AI spacethe speed of innovation has been so fastlike I remember initially way back whenyou started off the adoption technologywas done in CDs you get the CD you get alearning path with it and you ramp uphere all the time in the world now VRtechnology goes the click of a button sothe learning adoption and the expectedresults from that are also expected atthat pace that we are today right do youwant anything today yeah and and to thatpoint even if you go back a few yearsanything you needed to learn anythingyou were getting started with the placeto go to would have been to a searchengine you go to Google you search forit and I still remember the jokes abouthow people used to say oh you knowsearching is a skill and it still islike oftentimes two people searching forthe same thing one may end up withbetter results than the other and nowwith all of these AI tools andcapabilities available like Bard you cango and have an AI tool do that searchfor you and potentially come up withwhat most people have found useful inthat space so it's like even over thecourse of every year things are gettingbetter and easier and faster for peopleto get started and get going and the keyaspect for that and I'm sure you guyshave experience as well is when you wantto learn a new technology you'll learnup to speed there are learning paths youneed certifications you need collateralto go and get Hands-On with it right sothere's a whole plethora of artifactsthat need to follow to make thetechnology useful and get ramped up thenthe last piece is templates and jumpstart so you ramped up you've learnedabout it but now you want to getproductive and show Roi how do you gostart doing that you need templates andjumpstarts to do that and as you learn anew technology you build your owntemplates sort of deploy things fasterand quicker right with that in mind I'dlike to share a quick survey that wesort of uh did this last year one wasfroman online learning experience where theywent and serve it people saying ifyou're this age group or this technologywhat are your learning preferences andmodalities and all that so 80 now go toonline resources to learn right and thebiggest challenge we sort of heard backfrom that survey was the initial bump ofgetting familiar with the technology thelanguage or the stack that you're goingto work with right with that in mindas a developer it's more and moresort of critical for us to go throughthe cycle a new technology comes out youget started you expect to get productivewith it start deploying stuff and thenshow results right within that cycleGoogle is investing into the areas oflearning paths tools and then you saw ademo this morning at the keynote abouthow you can use Ai and do AI to sort ofhelp you with that right one of the keythings I can share an experiences is Istarted my journey in developer supportand escalation engineer and when acustomer calls you the problem somethingis broken you need to learn somethingabout something new you go askingsomeone in the next cubicle or someoneelse to refine the solutions for thatright and with the Advent of AI and doit AI you have that personal sort ofhelp which collates that say tribalknowledge for you right with that inmind I'll hand it over to srinath tosort of walk us through these threeareas awesome soI'm going to do a few different thingstoday I'm going to talk about as adeveloper especially if you're startingwith Google Cloud there are a plethoraof tools that are available for you thatcan help make your onboarding and yourproductivity Journey much easier so I'mgonna talk very briefly about a few ofthose and we'll see some of those in ademoum so to get started what are some ofthese tools right so as a developer ifyou were to come and ask me what are thethings I should familiarize with mostfrom a tools perspective these wouldpotentially be three of the things thatI would point out to so first off youhave Google cloud CLI so what is GoogleCloud CLI Google Cloud CLI is a commandline tool that you can install on yourlaptop and it's going to let you performmost of your Google Cloud ResourceManagement type of operations as well asyour authentication and things like thatright from a CLIum I definitely recommend all of youespecially if you're new to Google cloudand learning to go take a look at ourconsole familiarize yourself withproducts because obviously Day Zero whenyou're getting started there's going tobe a lot more information there there'sgoing to be a lot more detailed abouthow you can go and do things whatdifferent options are what they mean andall of that but once you get to thatbase level of productivity and you'regoing into your day to day three ofactually developing having a tool likeGoogle Cloud CLI can really help you dothese things a lot faster and one otherquick example I want to point out iseven going back to the stack Overflowsurvey and like even research we've doneinternally at Google but also inconversations I've had with developersand customers right oftentimes majorityof developers spell and I'm sure most ofyou know this right like developersspend a big bulk of their time in theIDEnow every time you have to contextswitch out of that there is a cost to itso most developers spend a majority forsure of their time in the IDE and theywant to see how they can get helpwithout contact switching out and withGoogle Cloud CLI it lets you do a lot ofthese operations that you need towithout having to context switch out andcontext switch back in the second one isthe Google Cloud SDK so we have sdkswhich are client libraries for youravailable across most of the popularlanguages and these will help youprogrammatically interact with productsand I've specifically chosen cloudstorage just as an example for todaywe're going to see that in a fewdifferent ways in the demo that I'mgoing to do in a bitand the last one is cloud code so I'mnot sure how many of you are familiarwith Cloud code actually let me doanother quick informal poll how many ofyou have heard of cloud code okayum so one thing I would recommend isespecially if you're in your IDE go tothe marketplace and look up Google Cloudcode we are Google Cloud code isavailable on Visual Studio code it'savailable on the IntelliJ jetbrain Suiteof Ides as well and it lets you do a fewdifferent things first off it makes iteasier for you to pull in API sampleslearn about things and to really writecode to work with gcp it lets you doyour inner Dev Loop much more easilywhenever you're building Cloudapplications and again especially ifyou're doing it with gcp but withrespect to deploying this to Containersor Cloud functions or wherever you'retrying to deploy whatever code you'reright and the third reason I think youshould try out Cloud code is because allof the things that you are seeing oryou've been seeing with respect to duetCloud code is the way that it comes intothe IDE so when you install Cloud codeas a part of that duet is going to getinstalled as well and uh so we'll take alook at that in a minute as wellsowith that as you try to get productivethere's a few things that a few stepsthat you can take a few things that youcan do that might help you along in thatJourney first off there's going to besample applications Cloud code gives youa few sample applications especially ifyou're new to Google cloud like a HelloWorld app and a few other applicationsto start with containers Cloud functionsCloud run so it makes it easy for you toget started and and of course if you'regoing for more complicated things thereis so many open source applicationsavailable where you can get started andI guess the big key there is as youcontinue to work through this you willcome up with your own templates you willcome up with your own sort of gettingstarted applications that you can theneither like share it with more folks inyour company or like you know at leasthelp improve your productivity throughthose uh Cloud API browser we'll take alook at it quickly but it's somethingthat's available through Cloud code thatlets you look at apis enable them lookat code samples and pull them in andlastly of course bringing in AI powertools AI power tools can do a lot foryou and especially with the speed atwhich this technology is evolving todayit helps you write code and it's gettingbetter and better at these things so I'mdefinitely excited to see what are newerand more interesting capabilities thatcome in over the yearsum with that with thatum sorry wrong sidewith that I'm going to go through aquick walkthrough and I'm going to showyou Cloud code and a few of the thingsthat we talked aboutall right there we go so first off whenyou do log into your idea today for thisdemo I'm just using visual studio codebut when you go to Marketplace and yousearch for Google cloud or Cloud codethis is the IDE plugin that will thatyou'll be able to install once youinstall it there is a walkthrough forduet AI that lets you see exactly howyou can use and interact with you at AIbut rest assured there's a lot ofsessions over the course of thisconference that's going to a lot moredetail so I'd definitely recommendlooking those up and attending some ofthose as well for duet specificquestionsbut this in essence on the left is whatyou're going to see when you installCloud code as I mentioned one of thethings that so so Cloud code is going tolet you do a lot of things so if you goto the command prompt you're going to beable to very easily spin up a newapplication choose the platform that youwant like I mentioned Cloud runkubernetes Cloud functions and thenthere's also going to be prompts thatlet you deploy it into those particularplatforms and in this particular casewhat I have done is I have uhpreemptively downloaded a kubernetesapplication just to make sure that we'renot uh dealing with internet issueswhich luckily we haven't so everything'sgreat so this is what so what you seehere is a python hello world sampleapplication that I have downloaded andum this is going to have everything ifyou go and look here it's going to haveeverything that you need to very quicklyand easily deploy this application intogcp now this is where the power of duetAI comes in soif you want to write an application likelet's say you as I mentioned I'm goingto be talking about Cloud functions alittle bit today cloud storage a littlebit today but let's say you want tocreate a cloud storage bucket what youcan do is you can just have a comment inthere that says write a function tocreate a Google Cloud Storage bucket andyou hit Ctrl enter and what device isgoing to do is it's going to generatethis code sample and it's going to showup right theregive me one second let me make sure I'mgood onyeah I've been having some internetconnectivity issues today which has kindof which meant this has been a littlebit of Hit and Miss but but anyway we'llcome back to this and take a look atthis momentarilyumbut again you have duet chat here that'sgoing to let you do the exact samethings as well where you can go and askquestions and it's going to help yougenerate code and do all of those kindof thingsum so so with that we took a quick lookat Cloud code and what cloud code cangive you now um the next thing I'm goingto do is I'm going to talk about a fewother tools that are specificallylearner focused and going to help youespecially if you're getting startedwith your journey either in cloud oreven if you're just learning to programright so one of the partners who we'vebeen working with on this front isreplit so I'm sure many of you haveheard of replied replit is a great placeto go and learn to code like they havethis course on learning to code inPython in 100 days which is very popularand so we've been working with replitand uhas a part of this partnership what youhave now is uh as of today morning wenow have some templates available herein Rapid that you can easily open up andstart interacting with some of theseapis and in this case the exact API thatwe've pulled in is uh for storage justto show you just to continue with thattheme not only that very soon you'llalso be able to from right from theGoogle Cloud documentation Pages you'llbe able to open code samples startingwith a few and then over time going tomore samples you can directly click onone button and open it and wrap it onceyou do this replit also has an extensionavailable that's going to help youeasily authenticate into Google cloudand once you authenticate into GoogleCloud you will also be able to so allyou do is you say connect it to Googlecloud and it's going to walk you througha set of steps to authenticate and onceyou do that you will be able to run thisAPI sample and get productive reallyreally quickly and the last thing I wantto talk about out before handing back toRohit is in addition to all of thisthere are of course a lot of other toolsout there like for instance Bard you cango to Bard and what you can also do withBard is you can go and search for theseexact same kind of things right like uhit's a great tool because at the sametime it's going to let you plan yourtrips but it's also going to let you uhwrite code so there's a lot of thesetools and capabilities that are becomingavailable so I definitely recommend thatyou all go and try out some of thesetools and this is a great set of thingsthat you can use to help you getproductive faster and to go faster onceyou've startedumso the one other thing I do want tomention is so we talked about templatesthat are available through Cloud codethrough code samples and how you canimprove those templates over time overtime as you get started but anotherreally great feature or a product inGoogle Cloud that's become generallyavailable at next is our jumpstartSolutions so what jumpstart Solutionsprovide you as you can see on the leftis it takes popular tasks or things thatas a developer you might want to try andhas the entire stack available for youso that you can click and deploy it withone touch so that you don't have to gothrough figuring out exactly how to getthem all networked get them all workingso it's it's a one-click solution that'sgoing to let you deploy theseapplications and go from zero to havingthem up and running in no timeso with that I'm going to hand off toRohit and Rohit you you're new to Googleright so why don't you tell us a littlebit about what you've learned as a partof learning and getting started withGoogle Cloud awesome well that soundsgreat so I've been in Google about aboutjust over a year now right and one ofthe things that sort of helped me waslike I said before the learning pathsthe certifications and the quick startsright so I'll share a few of those thatsort of helped me through my journey toget it startedum and I highly recommend folks whohaven't done this to try it there aremore certifications more learning pathscoming out every day so go explore thosethat were very helpful to me rightso one of the things that sort of helpedme out was this map here is I want Icame from an application modernizationspace so it sort of gives me a guidedway of saying if I wanted theapplication modernization what are theareas that I should look for and whatcontent should I go and sort of learnthe learning paths and things like thatright there's a plethora of content outthere and this helped me navigate thedirections where I want to take my nextsteps in my professional Journey it alsohelped me uh I'll show the story is Ihave a son who's in high school rightnow and he had a project to do forbuilding a mobile app and I don't knowhow many of people here have worked withxamarin or tools before to build across-platform mobile app and it's avery long tedious process even thoughsort of tooling helps you right with thedocument learning path and templateshere we will we were able to build afloral app talking to the back end inabout say three days so from coming fromzero to get to that these learning plansand templates really really helped usget to that place rightthe first one that ever helped me was togetting started with Google Cloud I comefrom a background of Microsoft and AWSCloud experiences right so gcp was verynew to me so this path really helped meget started understand what the Hands-Onlab environment inside gcp platform washow do I get my account set up how do Istart doing through the labs and sort ofspinning things up and trying them outwithout any sort of hurdles right itmade it very seamless for me it also hada few if you look at number seven andeight sort of similarities between whereI come from and my knowledge of clouddevelopment on Azure and how related towhat I want to do in gcp so those arethose sort of were very helpful for methe next thing that has helped me was inthe most recent sort of uh Innovationsthat's advancements in generative AI isI was new to this space right andpersonally coming in from outside rightso these sort of learning pathsintroduction llm responsible AIfundamentals helped me sort of ramp upin this particular space so the firstone helped me get familiar with the gcpcloud space this one helped me get sortof ramped up on the generative AI spaceand I also wanted to call out there areseven new AI courses that sort of beenpublished recently as well I don't knowif you guys have seen this but I thoughtI'll put it here these help youunderstandthe boat modeling image generationcaption modeling and Architects decoderwhich you saw some of the Demos in thekeynote this morning as well so we havethem here I would love for you to sortof try these out they're very helpful inmy journey so far right uhbuilding on top of that one of the keyaspects is certifications in today'sthing in a professional career right toshow credibility on the domain knowledgeand things like that so there are thecertifications that we keep building onwe also have a list of certificationshere depending on your domain ofexpertise and where you want to gocertification you can explore and sortof take forwardthank youforeign"
