youhave a simple question in mind that youwould like to answer and the questionwould sounds likehow can you leverage generative AI torealize your startup ideanow this is exactly the same questionthat connected story and Thomas areasking me some months ago and that'sbecause we are here here today so todaywe want to share with you how connect astory and Google Cloud collaboratetogether to realize a business idea andby the end of this session you will knowhow connected story is able now tounlock the power of personalizationusing generative AI on Google CloudI am Ivan nardini I'm a customerengineer at Google cloud and Icollaborate with customers in order torealize their business idea usinggenerative AI on Google cloud and todaywith me we have tomazova carella the CEOof connected sorry everybody thanks forjoining us I'm the general manager andco-founder of connected stories over toyou even so without further Ado let'sstart from the beginning of this thisstory in this story so when we startworking together with the connectedstory uh in March they came to me andthey shared out of one of the biggestchallenges in the marketing industry infact ideating and creating content forrunning successful marketing campaign isuh is a R2 scale and it requires timeand resources so now I was not an expertin a marketing industry so I askedtomazo to tell me more about the processof creating marketing content so let'sstart from the ideation of the contentwhen you start deviating some marketingcontent you have to collect a lot ofinformation first of all you start fromyour target audience so you try tounderstand who you're trying to reachout what are their needs what are theirinterests and then you do some researchover competition in a way that you canfind some differentiators and also youlook at Trends because you want tounderstand what people are talking abouta particular Brands online or what arethe latest on a particular industry thatyou are trying to create marketingcontent so once you collect all theseinformation then you brainstorm theinformation with the teamand you come up with a possible list ofideas that you have to prioritize basedon a business constraint or what ispossible and finallyum I mean or you put everything togetherand you realize what this is a sort ofprototype or the final idea now the theprocess that you can see here it lookslike linear but it is not in factformalizing a marketing content requiresseveral back and for and new informationcomes which actually take more time tobe processed and so basically whathappened is thatum in add more resources in order tofinally get the final content ideaso because of uh because of the natureof this process one of the questionswill be can be like will be better ifyou can find a way to navigate all thisinformation so for example just imaginethat you have a virtual assistant thatis able to summarize all the informationaround your marketing campaign anddestruct inside about the marketingdocumentation that is needed Trendinside on your customer rather than youtaking this information and extractingthose Inside by yourself so this wouldsave a lot of time that they can beinvested by your team in otheractivities such as in exploring newideas or creating a new new strategiesbut this is just one thing so let'sassume that um you are able to finalizethis uh content idea at this at that atthat time you still have to realize itright so this is how a process ofcontent uh ideation might look like soyou start by drafting the content sodrafting is the initial stage of thecontent deviation process and it's thestage where you come up with a conceptand you start putting it together thenyou need to create the concept and sothis is when you write design and uhfinally realize your idea by creatingimagesaudios shooting videos and so on andonce you get the content before topublish it it needs it needs to bereviewed in case change it and once thecontent is approved then you you need totake care of publish it reaching outyour audience on different touch pointsnow as you can imagine also this processof content creation will require timeand resources and one thing that is alsoimportant to a light is that once youget your content this content is not isgonna Target like a broad audience andis not tailored on particular users andthat you would like to reach outso there is still a challenges ofpersonalization rightthe problem issorry the problem is so what thequestion that we would like to answer isthat would be better if you can createmore personalized Contour faster againas I said this is still a challengebecauseum personalizing content creatingpersonalized content requiredthat you are able to process Marketsignal in real time and integrate thismarketing scene on in everything thatyou put together until that time sothat's why this uh the process that Ijust described doesn't fit with thepersonalization that you are trying tothat you are trying to achieveat this point it should be almost clearto you that generative AI can be used toaddress some of these challengesin fact regenerative AI once you areable to collect real-time informationwhat you can do is that you can combinethese real-time information and as aninput and feed a generative AI modelsthat allows you to personalizeeverything all the information that youput together until that point andgenerate personalized content atcustomer level in real time in and infew I mean a few secondsso now you can you can imagine howexcited I was when we started discussingabout this idea and how excited was toknow that everything was possible thankstoum the amazing collaboration that wehave we connected story team and thegenerative I support on Google Cloud asyou can see in this picture Google Cloudprovides several General capabilitiesthat are accessible to every userstarting from business going to AIpractitioners and developersparticularly we connect the stories wedecide to use generative support onvertex AI which gave them theopportunity to test tune and deployGoogle's foundational model in theirconnected story marketing platform inorder to create personalized contentwith palm for chat and text nowconnected story is enabling marketers toask questions about the marketingdocumentation and generatingpersonalized copies and with imagine nowcreatives can personalize marketingcontent at skill in minutes but I don'twant to go further here I don't want tospoil it moreso I will pass to tomazo that we willtalk more that we'll talk more aboutwhat connected stories is capable ofthanks to General DVI on Google Cloudtomazo over to youwell thank you and thanks for thebeautiful introduction againgeneral manager and co-founder ofconnected stories so we saw with evenhow generative AI actually allows toscale personalization but one thing thatwe didn't necessarily address is theimportance of the actual 3Dpersonalization and the reason why isthat media marketers andI focused mostly on optimizingstrategies around Target audiences moreso than actual creatives whereas thecreative for the 75 percent of the timeis what actually contributes to theeffectiveness of the campaign strategytherefore creating personalized contentis actually the most important thing inorder to engage users and thereforemaking a campaign successful so when welaunch connected stories so we wanted toactually have a platform that couldsolve some of the challenges if not allthe challenges that even is talkingabout in terms of scalability in termsof use of data and Collective storage isa Security Management platform reallyallowed to introduce for the first timethe use of data in an automated way sothat we could actually measure andcreate content fasteruh through the different solutions thatwe have at our disposals the idea hadalways been to remove the technicalcomplexity and therefore democratizingthe process of accessing data-drivencreatives in real time making it asscalable as possible to actually bringit to life and in order to do so weactually utilizedAI artificial intelligence since day oneto actuallysupercharge every module of theconnected storage platform the platformis composed in three different modulesI'll show you in a second one is thecreative Studio the decisioning systemand the creative intelligencewhich thanks to the help of our friendshere at Google Cloud we have actuallybeen able to work shoulder to shoulderand bring that to life however somethingrevolutionary happened at the beginningof the year we saw the Keynotes uhyesterday today and all we talked aboutwas generative AI generative AI cansolve so many different things inparticular when it comes to our industrymarketing and advertising wasessentially the missing ingredient forthe platform in order for us to actuallyconnect the dots of the other AI basedSolutions and really expedite theprocess of content personalization solet me show you guys how the platformworks on one end we have the generativeAI power created studio is the solutionthat is used by content creators itallows to actually mix up interactivewidgets in data driven conditions tocome up in real time with actualcreative conceived so thatwe are allowing for personalization onscale so now the use of generative AIreally allows to come up and edit thecontent from scratch really creatingmany more creative at our disposals sothat in this case our AI decisioningbased systemwhich is actually the centralorchestrator of our platform is nowcapable of selecting more content andtherefore in turn generating betterperformance how the system works isbasically constructed through the use ofcustom machine learning models which arefitting from our own first party datawith clients first party data byreal-time signals as well all coming outtogether in order to actually select themost effective content that areassembled through the query studio inreal time in order to make sure thatduring the campaign we're actuallyhitting the kpis and thereforemaximizing the effectiveness of thecampaign Effectiveness that we actuallymeasure through our query intelligencedashboards so our clear intensedashboards are built on on bigquerythey're built on with the use of forexample Vision AI allow to create as youcan see different heat Maps or verygenerally understand and how users areactually interacting with the specificcontent which is very different from forexampleon media buyers too when they just lookfor example all theum entirety of just the inventory or theplacements we don't necessarily focusingon the creative and the greedy as wetalked about again is the most importantpiece you creative intelligent dashboardthen also creates recommendationsrecommendations are actionable and thatcan be used between our decisioningsystem to optimize the campaign in realtime but at the same time through ourgenerative AI a powerAI power Studioto keep on modifying and keep thisfeedback loop going therefore creatingsomething essentially unique when itcomes to ideating the content automatingand keep on generating the content sothat the campaign keeps on improvingmore and more however today we want tounveil something something new we areextremely excited about it it'ssomething that we worked very closelywith the folks here at Google cloud andessentially this is something that isgoing to turn outum going to make connected stories thefirst 3D managing platform 100orchestrated by generative AI we namedit jaina Sanswhich as you guys can tell it's a prettyinteresting play on Renaissanceum the idea here is uh a new Totalcomponent of our creative Studio whichis now gonna allowing users to actuallyinteract directly with a chat interfacethat is againum built on uh palm and the differentsolutions such as for example imagedescription as well part of vertexa AIapis that is capable of doing two majorthings on one end we are capable oftaking campaign briefs directly withinthe chatbot so that is actuallyanalyzingthe most effective solution andtherefore orchestrating through promptswhat the creative studio and thedecisioning system will go about andessentiallycreating a much more automated way forusers to come up with content so this inturns changes completely the way notonly content creators go aboutconceiving their strategies conceivingtheir campaigns but also obviouslyutilizing the platform platform that youcan now essentially talk to more so thanhaving to manually set up everythingfrom uh from scratch as I would say anyother platform you have to go throughum about so this from our initial testagain the generative AI power Studio hasbeen on for the last six months now thisgenocence we're actually unveiling ittoday so go on to our website it's goingto be available as a private beta forthe next months or so we areactually collecting as many feedback aswe as we can so your feedbacks will bevery precious but from our initial testwhat we're saying is that ninety percentof time uh that it took to actually comeup with content is now being shrinkedfrom days to really a few hours which iswhich is massive and at the same time itallowed to optimize between media teamand strategy team campaigns much fasterwhich in turn obviously improveperformance even moreand therefore fulfilling the process thepromise of unlocking the promise ofpersonalization at scaleum thank you everybody[Music]"
