at the world economic Forum inJanuary of 2018.and he went on to sayyou know how you feel as the people inthis roomimagine how the people who are not inthis room feel about changeand those are the people we serveand that's why supercharging the publicsector with AIis an objective that can accelerate ourobjectives overalland give us the promise and the realityof achieving that gap between what ourconstituencies are worried about and thepromise of what this could beso joining me I have an amazing panel ofexpertsTammy Lee is joining us from Hawaii asthe deputy director of Department ofTransportationand Tammy has already taught me a greatlesson about resiliencyso the next time anyone asks me to joina panel or be part of a presentation andI think I have too much going onI will think of you Tammy and how youjoined today with us so I you know I'mvery appreciative of of you being herewith us and the work we're doingtogetheralso we have a opportunity at the end ofthis session for a moment for Hawaii soI would ask you even if you're rushingto the next thing please stay for thatit we hope it will be a very meaningfulmoment so yeah we look forward to thatas welland also joined by an expert Joe Larsonand Joe is the Deputy Chief digital andAI officer at Department of Defensearguably the largest I.T budget in theworld and I would say Joe probably alsothe most data in the world and then thepotential and possibility of doingsomething with that in a meaningful wayso so welcome Jillthank youand our third expert is secretary AmyTong with the state of Californiagovernment operationsI felt like Amy's objectives were sorelevant for all of usfor Amy your organization I wanted toshare it with everyoneher objectives are to accelerateinnovationdevelop a skilled Workforceand promote results-oriented practicesand for me those are the same objectivesI have for my own team and I bet formany of you today so we all have so muchto learn about the possibility of thisfrom these experts so thank you so muchfor for joiningget started Iand you know you get in these panel likethey've all already seen the questionsthat's not the case here so this shouldbe excitingso we'll start with Tammy and and thiswill help the panel to get to know eachother I know Joe is super nervous rightnow so watch Joe in particular uhmorning person or night owl Night OwlJoe morning person I know uh coffee orteastart with Amy watercoffeea Barbie or OppenheimerTammyRyan Gosling so Barbiecan we say barberheimer yeahI did all that okay nice and maybe aquestion on sort of your hidden talentor something if we read your bio we'dnever learn about you like tell us asecretAmy hidden talents do not know how tocookI'm sure that's a talent but it's asecret not anymoreI got nothing nothing uh yeah it'sspeaking like a DODlack of creativity I guessI'm learning to play the electric guitarso I told myselfif I learned The Stairway to Heaven solothen I'll buy myself a Liz Paul Gibsonguitar wow[Applause]do a lightning roundum so the last question is AI orsecuritybut of course I'm not going to have thepanel answer this becausethis is sort of the whole point of ofthe panel but Google has always beenpositioned at this intersection of AIand security whether you look back athow we approach search or Maps ortranslate it we've always interacted andand provided products and have such anintuitive user experience that we don'teven think about the fact that we'reoperating at that intersection andthat's that very fundamental piece thatwe're bringing into use cases in thepublic sector those use cases that helpcitizens in terms are our residents interms of support for services in theirlanguage those kind of use cases thathelp government employees with gettingthrough all of the paperwork they haveto get through or maybe in a new skillarea where a job application in askilled area they've never worked withbefore or maybe operational efficiencythat really just helps to develop theefficient see whether that be fraud orwhether that getting benefits toCitizens or residents fasterI have a couple numbers that there's a140 billion dollars of unclaimedbenefits annually in the U.Slike we should be able to address that11 billion hours of paperwork burdenand and even more when you look at whatthey call the time tax of people tryingto interact with the government and thisis true around the world and there's noreason for it this notion of how weaccess information which really is anobjective of Google's is Google'smission to be able to access informationand have it be usefulcan close these gapsso to address these gaps we want to hearwhat the panel is actually doing so thisnotion of accessibility Tammy let'sstart with you and you know there's beenso much resiliency in Hawaii Through TheYears through the decades but also mostrecently how is accessibility shapedyour strategy and priorities so bothinternal and external internal for us onour climate resiliency insightsinfrastructure platform that we workwith Google oninternally our project managers we havepolicies that say we're to considerresiliency in all of our projectsbutour project managers you know don'tquite know what that means in 2021 wedevelop like this climate climateadaptation plan but you know it's astatic plan there has some GIS mappingbut partnering with Google to put thisplatform and put all of thevulnerabilities and all of thestrategiesum just in one spot our project managersnow can go into you know this publicfacingum to make decisions on how or whentheir projects you know long-termshort-term and for external for thepublic I think the platform shows thewhys you know we're not going to sendthe public to look at our climateadaptation plan because it'll bore themto death but they can see thisinteraction interactive tool and theyget to know the whys of why we're doingthese long-term projects or theseshort-term projects based on thevulnerabilities through climate changeit's really powerful to think aboutaccessibility from the standpoint ofyour who we serve and who serves themso both the the the end user if you willas well as the employees those arepowerful use cases for usJoe you approach accessibility in a waytoo in terms of how you've set up thisCenter of Excellence to support all ofDepartment of Defense how how has thatobjective shaped the way you'veapproached the the center uh for anybodythat's worked in the dod you referencedit's the largest public institution inthe world and accessibility is atremendous challenge I think everybodywould acknowledge that across thedepartment I know we're talking aboutsupercharging AI but my portfolio ismostly the AI portfolio cdao but wespend our time really on data issues andmost of them foundational data issues asthe you know core accessibilitychallenge across the Department ofDefense when the you know the currentleader of the department for data camein in 21 there was a data decree signedand it really is lighted our way I thinkwhen we think about data accessibilitywhich is the most important thing youknow we think about both the equality ofopportunity to access the data but alsothinking about how we enable outcomesthrough the use of that data and ourmost important problems and workflows soyou know when we established the cheapdigital and AI office with really dataas the driving consideration our ourFocus has really been aboutum you know enacting that data decreeand uh you know for us that means how weunlock our data that there's a number ofways that we're engaged in that todaysome of them in partnership with Googleand other partners that may be in theroom there's the problem of our systemsrelying on formats and we don'tincentivize making data available as aproduct or an asset so how we do thatacross all of our initiatives where webuy systems but then we don't make thedata and those systems readily availablewe're thinking a lot about our datacatalogs and our our apis as we workwith apogee for example and the Advantainitiative which we lead in cdao is theDepartment's largest data catalog anddata sharing initiative in its historyfocused on some of those Enterprisebackendsmore of the point though on dataoutcomes you know I really think there'sthree levels that we're focused on thisthe first is just simply a culturearound data that that has to change I'vebeen a program manager and at no pointin the dod when I was a program managerdid anybody approach me and say how areyou making your data accessible andusable how are you thinking about dataas a product and we need to incentivizethat kind of behavior through the way wereward successes and um you knowincentivize a culture where people feellike making data available and freelyavailable to do things like AI makesthem successful and make other makesothers successful that's not our cultureand we're thinking a lot about how tochange that and then there's also simplyan education piece associated with thisand the education is not just for theexisting Workforce there's a talent andrecruitment problem that's significantsignificant across the dod and in cdaowe're starting a digital talentmanagement Branch that's really workingthrough the problem of how we you knowboth better leverage commercialTechnologies and bring people into thedepartment that under understand thatculture of data better and can bring itin and change it I think those are someof the ways we're thinking about theproblems of of data accessibility in thedod that's really powerful this notionof data foundationally the skills thegovernance and importantly the changemanagement which maybe maybe that's agood Bridge Amy to you so how are youthinking about access and Ai and I thinkimportantly the the key ingredientaround change management yeah absolutelyand excuse meand so wow this is the uh I guess I needmy water probably pretty soon too andthank you Christina um as both Tammy andand Joe talked about thank youlike you know how I'm going to make yourservice and data available in accessibleaccessible manner I I'll maybe I'll backup a little bit really from a servicedelivery aspectum you know I you know being Google hereand we having this huge and a turnout ofthe Google next conference just a lotsof kudos to the Google team hereobviously California is very proud to bethe home where Google headquarters andyou know we have a very ProgressiveGovernor when it comes to technology andInnovation but when we talk about in theadministration as I'm fortunate to beone of the cabinet member that this is aconstant conversation of his that whatdoes it mean by technology andInnovation when it comes to applyingthat into governmental Service deliveryand that's where you know a lot of theconversation about human-centered designwe make sure that we do what is mostimportant to our residents now only theservice that they prioritize but in theway that it's a accessible to them andin this case accessibility in many frontright from the ease of use the ease ofaccess and the east of understanding ifthere are information that are providedhow can be utilized and using an examplethat we work through and I see my officeof emergency services team here inCalvert California colleague earlier andI don't know if there's any other stateentity in the audience if you are araise your handI guess I was oh there were more thankyou thank you for being here you guys umthat through the covert response it wasthat it was just one of those uh ademonstration on where there's a lot ofdata that we needed to make available toyou know the the health professionalthis the scientists the researchers butif you simply present the data in itsraw data form nobody will understand itso therefore you're using a lot of toolsto make sure that it's in a some youknow simple form as possible whetherit's a dashboard whether it's reportAssociated without a narrative so thatyou know our residents can go in thereor understand what's going on but givinghow diverse California is singlelanguage obviously is not going to doright we have a minimum seven standardlanguage in many of the health space isminimum of 13 languages so making thatin a sensible manner from a languageaccess and all of that analysis is basedon data so it circles back to makingsure that we have good basis ofutilization of data and makingdetermination is where we serve where weprioritize our service and then use thevarious tools available to make thathappen so at the end of the day thatchange management conversation that wehad earlier right is not only for thepractitioner to understand that is a keybut as well as our program deliveryentities to understand that this is thefundamental what we do making sure thatwhether it is change management whetherit's access whether it is languageaccess we have a single goal is makinggovernmental Services accessible andeasily understood by our residents Imean I think it's so powerful the thepartnership with Google with state andfederal level that that is aimed aroundaccessibilitybut at the other on the other sidethere's so many places to start likethis is such a big mandate for us how dowe select where to start or what's agood use case how how do you apply theprioritization maybe Amy start with youand we'll go through the panel on thisyeah um as you mentioned um you knowCatherine my uh my role as Governmentoperation what does that mean right Ihave my colleague here in governmentoperation we literally had thisconversation like for those of us thatin the government we're thinking okaythis is like running the state ofCalifornia as like the Chief OperatingOfficer of role but for public what doesthat really mean I I have theresponsibility for technologyprocurement Workforce Developmentrevenue for those of you they pay taxhopefully over here sales tax income taxa pension and as well as many of we havea new project called a cradle to Careerwhich is also actually developing fromeducation front developing somebodysomebody's career from looking at thataspect that's what keeps governmentrunning right but the end of the day ouragency also supports the climate agencythe environmental agency the officeEmergency Services you name it to makesure that those front-end Services beingprovided so from that aspect what whatis government what is our prioritizationright we serve the people who serve theresidents so in many cases we're lookingat Workforce Development how do we makesure these tools and and services areoptimally utilized to transform howgovernment delivers but at the same timefor the program delivery how do we makesure that those tools are alsounderstood in working with our residentsdoes this make sense to you does thishelp you so I think I I would I wouldsay in the prioritization I'm a littlebit long-winded on this because we are afoundational services on how governmentoperates I would say you utilizingall aspect of change management in orderto best utilize the tool is a priorityof ours and that is an ongoingconversation that we barely scratchedthe surface at this point yeah I canimagine that's a continuousreprioritization process prioritizationon the daily basis and and on the otherhand a lot of these use cases you haveto stick with for a while to see themreally develop and have that changemanagement take effect yeah and that'swhat makes the I always say it is nevera dull moment in what we do because youhave to cycle through you have toiterate along the way we don't get topick three things that we do and bereally good at it we would love to dothat sometimes right but again givingthe sheer size and all of the thechallenges the state of California dealwith you're almost like three priorityfor today you get momentum going get itsustained and then you pick another youknow field so you're constantly rotatingthroughJoe how about on your side wellfortunately our prioritization islargely given to us which I'm I'mfortunate in with respect to thatbecause we operate on the basis of thisdocument called the national defensestrategy which outlines the defensepriorities and really provides us ourNorth Star and our Guiding Light for howwe you know really what we focus on howwe invest and the kinds of problemswe're trying to solve with respect tothat in terms of the problem of accessto data and AI one of the areas that Ithink that document has prioritized andwe find to be a really compelling placeis not just sharing within the dod butexternally sharing particularly with theUnited States allies and partners whenyou read that documentum you know more so than any nationaldefense strategy before it outlines thatthe prioritization has to be not justbeing able to operate as a DODinternally but to be able to share datamore effectively with interagencyPartners across the federal governmentwith industry and then with um you knowallies and partnered Nations but to doso in a secured way in an assured way sothat we can continue to operate so Iwould I would turn back to that documentas really the one that drives ourprioritization within the department Ithinkum anybody who's worked in the spacewould be aware that our Legacyacquisition systems and processes arenot well designed to enable data accessat scale we tend to think of largeplatform as the way we procure things webuy ships we buy planes we buy softwarein much the same way so you knowprioritization for us is thinkingthrough how we break through that andmake it so that you know the the datasharing and data data access equities ofthose initiatives are prioritized andthey're invested in and the Technology'sthere we have an Initiative for instancecalled The Joint all domain command andcontrol initiative with cdao where we'reworking this uh apologies for thejargonism and anachronism it's calledJazz too but essentially it's a problemof just how we have our systems talk toeach other and um you know I I could gointo detail about our approach to thatbut it's really about you know how webuild the technology how we incentivizethe creation of the right apis how we'redoing data standards and governanceacross the department how we're dealingwith the you know before we had thejoint we're fighting Cloud the lack of adepartment Cloud which has reallyhindered our access I think in the pastand we've moved past that jwcc is nowyou know incredibly in demand initiativethat I think is going to move the needlein terms of solving some of these coredata access and sharing problems but Ithink all those fundamentally Drive ourprioritization or the things we thinkabout when we deal with data access andAI access problems that's really helpfulI think for all of us to think about youknow having the clarity of thepriorities is not sufficient for drivingthe changes required to take advantageof everything that's happening right sothis is a very nice example where whileclear there's still all the rest of theof the data governance the changemanagement the collaboration acrossacross the teams that that need to be inplace to to have the impact so Tammy howabout on your side how do you how do youdeal with where to start and where tofind a use case that matters inprioritization so for the HawaiiDepartment of Transportation and I'msure this isum the same for all of Departments ofTransportation safety is our number oneprioritywe're no longer going to be reactive andthat's why we partnered with Googlewith our safety analytics platform youknow we have safety data we have thissystem called Shaka and it basicallyreports all fatalities and meter crashesto the federal government but withpartnering with Google does is it takeslike large sets of data components andit makes it where we can get crash datawe can get pedestrian and vehicleum you know where they walk in wherepeople drive where there's speeding andwe can createfor what Ai and working with Google doesfor us is it creates patterns to show uswhere are these high impact areas and tochannel on that and move it to wherethere are same types of conflicts withpedestrians and vehicles so that we canthere's a pattern that we can see so wecan not anticipate but do countermeasures in different areas rather thanwait for you know across your fatalityto happen with our climate climate Idon't know excusewithout her climate climate insightsplatformwe know you know that there arevulnerabilities with sea level risewith uhwater inundation what we didn't know andwhat working with Google has shown us issay take for example Rock fall we did wepartnered with the University of Hawaiiand with Consultants we know thevulnerabilitiesumbut what we don't know is where thedebris from a rock fall event will landI think it was in 2018 or maybe soonerum we had this project it was becauseone of these Rock Falls camedown we call it the Pali Highway wherethere's tunnels Town bound andum Windward bound so the town boundtunnels there was a rough ball thankgoodness nobody got injured I think therock it was humongous Boulder it landedand might have clipped a truck but therewas no accidents no fatalitiesbut working with Google and theseinsights it'll show us you know wherethese debris would fall and we canmitigate those types of real specificeventsthat's a really nice example I wasn'tthinking about that in the context ofprioritization but the idea of real-timeprioritization which which you have withthe Department of Transportation inHawaii I think is a real nice examplefor for many of us there's a nice demoof this as well that you can see reallythe power of having that data in placeand and what it can do to get resourcesin the right place at the right time soagain I think that's a powerful exampleof prioritization you also mentionedTammy the um the partnership but I knowall of these issues take a number ofPartnerships to deliver our ecosystem ofsupport to make real we have a number ofPartners not only Google in the roomwhat do you need from the people in theaudience or the people listening to besthelp you achieve your mission objectivesand Tammy we'll start with youokayum so the Partnerships that we have andand that we need are just bringing youknow we do Department of Transportationstuffum I learn at the harbors we have issueswith coral and we can't just like takethe coral we don't know whether it'sinvasive or not and and plop itsomewhere else so I think thosePartnerships likewith different disciplines are soimportant I thinkthis Administration is really reallyVisionary and deputies there are four ofus you know I was talking with Amandaearlier that we our director has such avision and we as deputies we work reallyhard to make it come true in my shotthere's HR we have procurement just likeAmy we have a bunch of things but on asmaller scale and sopartnering with we have this projectcalled high bridge and it's taking theseunmanneddrones and it's cutting down and savingmoney with Bridge inspections so it'sthose types of Partnerships that that weum you know Forge to help us to do ourworknot that we're not doing our corefunction but it helps us do our workstreamline quicker so that we can reapthe benefits that much sooner good so abroad ecosystem approach to achievementJoe how about on yourself if I couldraise a specific challenge where I needhelp in this room I'll take theopportunity it's kind of the reason Ireally wanted to come here today and putout a pitch it's the problem ofgenerative AI uh which I know where thesupercharging AI panel here thedepartment established an organizationabout three weeks ago was chartered forthose who have not seen it it's on theopen internet we're being verytransparent of what we're doing it'scalled task force Lima it's theDepartment's generative AI task force Ihave the mission commander of task forceLiam in the audience here today he worksfor me Captain Xavier Lugo U.S Navy thechallenge of generative AI is going toumit's going to the generative AI is goingto challenge the department on manysimultaneous fronts and accesses thatwe're trying to figure out all at thesame time you know both uh and I thinkbroadly I think as you can imagine we'reconcerned about both the enormous risksof the technology being misappliedmisused you know being misunderstood interms of its integration in ourworkflows but at the same time a normalpotential but unrealized and unprovenbenefits to a massive Enterprise thathas the need to leverage AI to solve anumber of its problems so task forceLima is fairly new it's about threeweeks old but we're really trying tobuild and we're really into industryinvolvement is helping the dodto understand technology that's evolvedso rapidlyum you know I'm here at Google rightattention is all you need with six yearsold or whatever but you know reallysince chat GPT we've seen the movementspread like Wildflower Wildfire acrossthe department and um we're working on anumber of sub initiatives uh that dealwith how we measure the performance ofmodels and understand what are themetrics and Frameworks to get toresponsible AI what's the strategy andguidance around these things how are webuilding our infrastructure and managingour data to make it responsible howwe're working with industry Academia andthe open source Community to responsiblyintegrate available Technologies to meetDepartment challenges and I think moreso than anything else what are the usecases where this technology is mostvaluable and really trying to Tamperdown on the idea that there's a you knowa monolithic AI out there calledgenerative AI that can solve all theDepartment's ills and really start toThink Through the specific workflows andproblems where the technology can beproven to have a you know validated andmeasured and an understood output andyou know that Alliance to theDepartment's work with responsible AI soum you know this problem of generativeis taking up a lot of our uh ourbandwidth right now and you know it's anarea of enormous challenge where we'regoing to need the integrated insights ofthe technology Community to advise andassist the department not just in termsof the delivery of your products but interms of you know the ramifications at abroad level of how this technologymanifests in our department so that's myask today and like any good Pentagonbureaucrat I'm going to say talk to himuh you know who will answer your queriesuh Xavier Lugo the commander of thatteam no but that it's so important againthat your your same point Joe sort ofyou have the strategy laid out but itcomes down to the details of where we'regoing to start and how we're going towork together so this notion ofselecting The Right Use case as part ofthis roadmap for organizationalReadiness for supporting changemanagement I think is a great call toaction for all of us working with theDepartment of Defense or any of of ourgovernment agencies how about on yoursideI would say not that California as beingcompetitive or not but I'm going to upon Joe on it so you guys ready to takesome notes on in term of more than onechallenges that we're going to put outhere I heard a sympathy uh clap here sowas that a good collab or a good clapall right let's let's get ready for thisso Joe was talking about this uh likeyou know big use case and Challenge onthat I would say to add on top of thatstate of California obviously being youknow really The Innovation Center tomany of these in generative AI it's it'sa it's a strong interest of theadministration I think there are a fewthings for those of you that arePartners in the room that we're reallyreally looking for uh help with butbefore I go there just like any otheryou know bureaucratic good person outhere I do also have an outstanding teamso uh Matthias if you want to stand upand just wave your hands so you guys canrecognize himum he's the one that go to you alongwith my colleague here Christina as wellas our teams from OES and coverCalifornia 150 departments likely manymany of them is going to explore sometype of Pilots just as a way of that wecould use this narrow use case tocontinue to learn what genitive ai'sbenefits as well as the risk around itright start for most yes security sideof it we have a cyber securityintegration Center which Google isalready partnered with need to know whatyou know how do we have a good awarenessof the risk but how do we mitigate rightto the extent possible that we have aresponsible use from a privacy from allyou know all of that it's a big topic ofours so for those who developerinteresting for the responsible use ofAI talk to us about itbut doing so by no means we want astifle Innovation and it's on theopposite is how do you innovate in aresponsible Manner and that's why thestate of California is going to look forpartners to work on various narrow casesum Healthcarehuge card part of it right the healthcare cost in a way that how do we use AIas a way to perhaps supporting some backoffice and I don't know I'm justthrowing it out there for people tothink about how do you apply thecapability of gender if AI into how wedeliver serviceclimate obviously a big topic we don'tlike wildfire in any manner especiallyin California so the the projection orthe prediction and you know how all ofthat goes Wildfire is huge part of itTransportation as Tammy mentioned wehave a huge Transportationinfrastructure here looking for ways tominimize the what do you call it theincidents that happens I I heard astatistic which is not a good statisticin state of California was that everyhour there's 12 people killed in theState Highwaythat is a scary statistic so mycolleague as the secretary uh withTransportation always show me anythingwe could do to help protect or increasethe safety of our roadway he's in rightso transportation is huge part of itobviously Emergency Services theaccessibility to make sure that in themoment of Emergency Response what is thequickest simplistic way to help ourresidents to safety it's obviously anarea that we always like to explore moreWorkforce Development which is in myagency right to make sure that the StateWorkforce as well as the generalWorkforce what is the Outlook of whatdoes generate I would create in thisdisruption of Industry moving forwardand how do we prepare our Workforce todo so so these just name a few againMatthias here probably has a laundrylist he would love to talk to Partnersas state of California can continue toexplore to learn this very helpful thankyou Amy I would also ask the panel youknow there's a bunch of people in theaudience that will take this contentback and we hope do something with it sowhat's your advice for those people inthe audience or the listeners online tohow to get started you know what ormaybe something you learned on yourjourney that you wish you knew beforeyou started so maybe Amy will start withyouare they twofoldum we are just like I said just it'sjust like a sponge at the moment amoment to absorb everything that we canlearn anybody's that would love to talkto us call me I'm sorry call Matthias tomake sure no I'm kidding aside we wouldlove to set up some type of you know ameet and greet even a virtual it'sconvenient for folks just to you know tohear what you're thinking for those ofyou that looking for a contractualopportunity getting to the state'sprocurement list it's a very veryimportant first step to make sure thatwe are are getting you ready at themoment when the moment comes that stayneeds to start building these Pilots soas they get your company ready for thatbut at the end of the day I we reallylooking at this is something that it's ait's almost a personal responsibilityfor everyone involved to make sure thatthey roll out or the launch or thecontinue launch as you say of generativeAI in it is in a responsible manner sofrom that aspect whatever advicesuggestion or getting yourself ready towork with the state of California we'reready for it very good Joe uh yeah Iwould I would concur we Face many of thesame challenges as my colleague fromCalifornia when we look at generative AII think we can all agree it you knowit's a technology that leaked from thelaboratory and largelyI would say the department needs to movefast to be prepared for a future whereit just is part of the way we do worktoday and you know it really challengesthe traditional sort of uh you knowDepartment process where we like toresearch a piece of technology wevalidate it we test it we deploy itum you know there's assurance that itworks we're able to you know map itsoperational ramifications and risk andreally compelling ways and you knowthere's Frameworks to be able toevaluate these things we don't have thathere because I I didn't come up with thetechnology track I'm a marine I came upthrough the you know the the use casetrack I you know I started my career asa young Marine Intel officer and theTemptation here is going to be enormousparticularly given when we're talkingthe large language models parts ofgenerative AI AI that the output is justso semantically rich and compelling thatit could be easily you know misutilizedand um you know so we really need helpis uh thinking through those challengesuh it's it's certainly a team sportum you know the department has uh wehave ethical AI principles that weadhere to we also have a number ofdirectives you know many of them werewritten in advance of these Technologiesand we're thinking through theresponsible AI ramifications but alsojust in terms of what we need to investin to get this right in a world wherethe technology is widely available inplaces outside of the department whichyou know is not the way we typicallyoperate so to the extent I could putthat to the audience here to come backto us and offer ideas and suggestions Iknow you're probably a question is howdo I get involved uh we're working onthat right now with our initiativethat's about three weeks old there willbe the opportunity for industryparticipation if you are government andyou're listening reach out to me todayand we'll begin to incorporate you intoour group that's Focus on these problemsit's really nice I mean it will we willall learn together in this so greatadviceI mean I know you have some experiencesand Lessons Learned also do you want toshare with the audience yeah so wedidn't start with AI we built uponan existing Foundation it reallycomplements what we're currently doingum we think that it justmakes us grow as an agency to be ForwardThinking and not being so reactionarybutand I think I think that withum you know this type of Technology wehave to be really honest and forthcomingwith our community members we have totell them exactly what data we're usingand what it what the purpose we're usingit for we have a project and it's calledum the Nimitz traffic signalmodernization project and basicallywe're optimizing the traffic signalsright now the technology is we havecameras on poles I think it's zip tiedto polls and we have these like trafficcounting Pucks in the asphalt andbasically you know we're going to bebuilding on that Foundation using umworking with Google using Ai and we'regoing to be able to seeum like the vehicles as well as thepedestrians and of course everybody willbe concerned about what are using thisdata for and why for us technology isagnostic we don't care really we're onestep removed from that so we have to becareful with explaining all of theprivacy concerns to the members of thepublicI think we have to tell them that wedon't careabout your trip really all we care is ifthe behavior or is making our roadsunsafeyeah you had also gone through changesaround your infrastructure to be able tosupport a future that is different thanhow the Department of Transportation waswas operating today so sometimes when welook more broadly at where we're goingthe North Star the priorities as Joetalked about can be well documented buttakes changes across the entireorganization and this investment in thefoundation includes an investment inskills and so one of the things that myteam did earlier actually a couple weeksago is we had an AI summer school on howmarketing will fundamentally changeand one of the opportunities we came upwith we did sort of a science fair ofuse cases that will absolutely changethe way we work our roles ourorganization and our ecosystem and aspart of that we looked at how musicmight changeand we wanted to honor Tammy and theresidents of Hawaiiwith one
