a preferred solutions forthousands of customers across Industriesto power their transformationin this session we will hear one suchtransformation story from the fifthlargest airlines in the USso without further Ado let me welcomeNatalie Berman and charu Jain fromAlaska Airlines take it away Nataliethank youuh true is going to come up in a momentand talk to you about a few things butfirst I wanted to introduce you a bit toAlaska Airlines many of you may not befamiliar we are the fifth largestairline in the United States we're the16th largest airline in the world wehave approximately 25 000 employees wefly to over 115 destinations this is ourroute map what's not shown here becauseI couldn't fit it in the map or theBahamas Guatemala Belize Costa Ricaother parts of Mexicowe're also a member of the One WorldAlliance so we sell uh 10 of our 10 ofour Global Partners on alaskainair.comand partner with an extensive networkreaching almost a thousand differentdestinations where you can earn andredeem Alaska miles so we're a big dealwe're also one of the most profitableairlines in the United States tominoja's point driven by really keyfocus on cost savings efficiency andoperations while also delivering greatcustomer experience we have anincredibly generous mileage plan we wereranked number one by nerd walletwe were just named the most Innovativeairline in the world so hopefully thisgives you an idea a bit of who AlaskaAirlines is I appreciate everyone comingif you didn't know who you wereum We Care a Lot this is something thatyou'll see the data for us is all aboutempowering our ability to deliver acaring experience it's what we're knownfor and it's something that we findreally critical in core to to our brandso the three things we're going to talkto you about today are three keyTransformations that we have undergonefrom from a data and analyticsperspective that have really propelledus to the Future and cheru's going totalk about the first two one is anInnovative industry first idea that sheinnovated I'm going to give her thetrademark of a digital Airline platformwhich really enabled a lot of additionalthings that we've now been able tounlock including curb to gate in fiveminutes or less and this idea of alobbyless future and then we'll talkabout modern retail which is how we'repartnering with Google cloud and GoogleCloud Partners to really reinvent theway that we sell airline tickets andservice our customers on our sites soI'm going to have churu come up and andtake you through the first twoforeigngood morning everyone uh thank you forbeing here I know it's been an amazingtwo days so I appreciate your grit forhanging on till this third day and beinghereum it's a it's a really exciting time atAlaska Airlines and uh I I you know I'mlooking forward to share that story withyouum and our uh for Natalie and two of ourleadership team members are here too foruh for Q a in the future so you know asI listened to sessions over the last twodays one common theme was yes data AIgen AI but it wasn't just about thetechnology it was also about leadershipand driving change and how to managerisks and what are the organizationalfactors so I'm going to build around andbring in some of those things as I um asI talk about these two things so eitherin Alaska six years ago as ChiefInformation officer and I had threeprioritiesfirst was to improve our stability andreliability because we all know if thebasics don't work nobody wants to have astrategic conversation with yousecond was how do wewe were going through the merger withVirgin America which a lot of you thatare here would understand really welland the two things that can make orbreak a merger are technology andcultureso we did thatand the third priority really I want toask you a question and maybe then I'llreveal it so how many of you have flownon Alaska Airlineswow I wish I could take a picture of allthe hands that are upwhat do you think makes us special andwhen Customer Service Awards year afteryearpeople who said thatwell Mike you can't answer you're analumnibut he's rightso our people are our magic sauce and somy third priority was how do I enableour employees to deliver a remarkableguest experiencesso to do thatwhat we have to do is to really put amobile tools in the hands of all ouremployees so all our csas have iPadsPilots have iPads maintenancetechnicians have iPads our flightattendants have iPhones and the reasonfor that is that they can do their jobeasily and they can interact with thecompany easily they can connect witheach other easily for flights to leaveand it's it's technology that's easy tounderstand it's not old screens andreally complex things to doum and and then the second thing was howdo we create a single view of the guestand that's really what I'll talk aboutin a little bit and third how do we makethat available to our employees how dowe make all of that informationso we are a 91 year old companyand like many others we have silos ofdata we have so many customer datastores we have things that don't connectto each other and there's really not agood way to see the full view of thecustomerand for us to really understand if acustomer is buying or shopping onalaskar.com versus they called Razversus they talk to a CSA at the airportor a flight attendant on the flight howdo we connect all of those things we hada lot of data from a marketing point ofview on customers but we were missing avery big piece which was the experiencethat they had with usso we knew a flight was delayed but ifVivek was on that flight we weren'tcapturing that Vivek had a delay andthat really was a bigbig gap in our customer data strategyso that's where this vision for adigital Airline platform started andit's all about how in real time do wecapture every event that's going on inthe airline and correlate that data andthen make that available to either ouremployees to take action or for otherparts of the company to take actionso it connects our employees operationsand back office together it's all eventdriven and so when an event happens aplane takes off we know it took off acustomer does something we know thatthis is what happened with them so nowif a flight is delayed the 178 people onthat plane we know they were delayed iftheir bag is lost we know that so andwe're continuing to enrich thisinformation and we in the future reallylook to capturing conversations thatguests have with our people and actuallyfeeding it into thisum Manoj asks us to leave this verycomplicated diagram up hereum but this is really the architecturebehind this and there's a lot ofinformation on this screen and reallywhat it highlights is a lot of thingshad to come together a lot of differentTechnologies and tools and processes tostart building what I would call adigital twin of the airline so if youwere sitting somewhere and you could seeeverything going on in a report whatdecisions would you make but since youcan do that because we go to we have 48million customers and we uh flight 118destinations ourselves so what is thatpulse of the airline that you can getand make decisions off of whether you'remaking decisions around crew or flightor guestssome of the things that we learned as wedid this waswe we started quickly and reiterated wehad a lot of these Technologies westarted with and then found that somethings didn't work and we had to goreplace it and then replace it again soit wasn't like the perfect world it waslearning as we were doing it but wedidn't wait for that so you know speedwas important to us and iteration wasimportant to usthe other thing um we had a lot ofdiscussions on is so we took all of thatdata and exposed it to our flightattendantsso they have this you know uh kind ofthe guestmood meter in a way like how pissed offis somebody going to be or how happy arethey with us so they understand wherethe guest is coming fromand we had a lot of debate around whatdo we eat what do we want the flightattendant to do with that dataand we had debates over oh we shouldtell them these are the two things theyneed to do because we're giving them thedata right so they should do somethingwith itso we actually have of all our employeegroups we have early adopters so we havesix thousand flight attendants 400 ofthem are early adopterswe have Legends Legends are as ourhighest reward of customer serviceso we talked to our early adopters andlegends and found from themon what they would do if they had thisdata and each of those examples was moreremarkable than anything we could tellthem to doso we basically decided not to tell themanything we kind of left it up to themto say when you see this you decide whatyou want to do and the stories that comein about how they apologize or how theythey're empowered to take steps they cando whatever steps is in their serviceframework and really have thatconversation with the guest and sothat's really led to a lot of you knowhow we get those Customer Service Awardsis really around our people our peopletake that step of making it special soit's all about how to enable them versusreally eliminate them and that's a bigpart of our strategyso this is again you know giving someexamples of how we're puttinginformation in the hands of ouremployees I should have clicked earlierso umso going back to sort of you knoworganization and career leadershipso those are my first three years of theCIOand then I had the opportunity to moveto the commercial side of the businessso it was a very it's a very unique rolethat's been created building on mystrengths as a CIO but also giving methe opportunity to learn new things andgrowso the first part of my job isreally havingall our digital channels whether they'redirect or indirect so B to C and B2B toC and really understanding where ourcustomers are buying our product andwhat their preferences are and how wecan merchandise to them so that's a keypiece of our partnership with Google andNatalie is going to talk about that howare we going to innovate in that areathe second part of my role is reallydefining and driving The Innovationstrategy for Alaskaso Alaska is known for being veryInnovative it's in our DNA we were thefirst to sell tickets online we were thefirst open self-service kiosks atairport we're the first to remove themand so as we as I took on the role Iworked with our Executives in our boardand what does innovation mean for Alaskaat this point in timethat was back in the 90s what do we wantto do now so we created a framework wecreated Focus areas and a strategy andfunding and to have teeth into it weactually for the Alaska Air grew Boardof members we created an innovationcommittee with five of the board membersand so we really Drive Innovation it'snot called a technology committee it'scalled an innovation committee and I runthat for Alaskaso Innovation is now one of four growthpillars for the airline in our strategicplanand we we Define Focus areas arounddriving revenue or guests or employeeexperienceseverything we do touches every part ofthe airline there's nothing we can dojust by ourselves because it toucheseither our in-flight or airports or ourcommercial teamsit was very important for us to saywhen as we do Innovation we do ideationon a lot of ideasbut we also get things into the hand ofour employees and our guests so itwasn't just about the cool ideas it wasalso about how we can transform ourbusiness with thatso the processes that we've set up allowus to quickly ideatefail succeed and then take those forwardinto a product and Engineering teams anddeliver them quickly and I think that'sgiven us an agility a business agilitythat allows us to compete veryeffectively and has led to a lot ofIndustry firsts and I think that's whyI'm very excited about our partnershipwith Google because I think those thingscome together really well that businessagility and the spirit of innovationso one of the things we have done latelyis this transformation of our airportand lobbies and that started witha business problemwe are an airline we are growth Airlineso we're a fifth airline in the U.S 16largest in the world and our whole thingis about growth how do we growas we grow all of you that travel noairports are a very constrainedenvironmentso how do we grow in an environmentthat's constrained but grow withoutadding costs and footprintso that was the challenge we took intowhat is the airport of the future looklike for us and we started with thelobby which is the check-in areawe we reimagined every piece oftechnology every process every role thathappens every guest behavior thathappens in that Lobbyand came up with a bold goal of gettingour guests through the lobby in fiveminutes or lesswith baggageso how did we do that we had tolike I said we had to re-imagineeverythingandum we started with dataso what do guests do in the lobbywe found okay well half of them havebags and half of them don't okay greatit should be easy for the ones thatdon't have bags to get through theairport in less than five minuteswell of the people that don't have bags60 still go and see an agentor go to a kiosk so what are they doingthere why are they going to the kioskhow have we trained them this technologyhas been there for 25 years now so we'vetrained them to go do something at theairport when they don't need toand of the people that have bagsthey are also going 60 to fullassistance because we don't have aself-service optionso we really looked at all of these andultimately where We've Ended up is threethree things one is we took that workthat guests were doing at the airportand move that outside of the airportso we've encouraged guests to check inand get a boarding pass before they getto the airportand the reason is you don't need to dothat at the airport and for those of youin the airline business you know thatgetting a boarding pass is not justchecking it is not just you're getting aboarding pass it means your ticket isall good and everything works in thebackground and you don't need to see anagentso by checking in when you're home inthe comfort of your home you have timeand if there's a problem you can callrest to fix it or you can allow moretime at the airport so it's predictableand what we're finding is every airportnow that we're installing this newprocess and technology and rolesour check-in before airport has gone up10 percent so our goal is to get to 90or like 79 right now and we haven'tfinished we're 50 deployed so that gasbehavior change has been keyto getting this to work then the secondpiece was when you get to the airportand you do need to use some things howdo we make that easy for you our kiosksare really really oldand people were spending two to three tofour minutes on them they're printing ona boarding pass the boarding passes oldas soon as you print it out because thegate can change the time can change sohow do we Inc when we encourage peopleto check in they get a digital boardingpass that they can useso we'd replace all our kiosks we werethe first in the industry to put them inwe're the first to take them out andreplace them with a product that wedeveloped ourselvesthere was no Airline or no vendorlooking at thisso again going back to providing mobiletools we use iPads and connected them toa backtech printer it was never donebefore it's the first time in theindustry that's been done and whatthat's now allowed us is it's a 45second experience versus the two tothree minute experience you can only doone thing which is about bags you can goprint a boarding pass you cannot doanything elseand then going back to our employees ouremployees have iPads and we've connectedthatto these back tax stations as we callthem so an employee always knows what'sgoing on there if a guest has an issuethey can help them remotely or they cancome and help the guest so again back tonot having the guests go from Line toLine to Linethey can stay where they are and we canhelp themthe second part of that was dropping abag so today we have to see an agent todrop a bag and check IDso we have announced our biometricstrategy that will help us provideself-service and we're going to belaunching automated backdrops these havebeen used widely in Australia and Europebut not in the US so we're the firstAirline that's going to put them at allour hubs starting next year and it's ait's a very seamless experience in youknow you you put your bag on the Belt Itscans it weighs and then it checks youridentity through Biometrics or otherwiseand then the bag goesso all of those are functions that letus get through the lobby in five minutesor less and then obviously our peopleare always there to help the people thatactually need help scanning a back tagis a very transactional experience buthelping people that need help is reallywhere they shineso 50 of this is deployed fifty percentof our airports now has this technologywhat we've learned is guest Behavior canbe influenced and changed we wereworried about people that would show upum you know demographically like olderpeople that may not be comfortable withthis we're finding they're actuallybetter prepared because they read theiremails and their notifications and areready versus some of the people youngerpeopleum we we found iteration and gettinglike rapidly iterating was reallyimportant we had the technology down butI think we're on the fourth version ofour form factor because getting it rightat the airport and being arepresentation of our brand was a bigthingumand so we're very excited about beingable to make this change and now we cangrow30 to 40 percent of passengers withouthaving a constraint in the lobbyand so we're not going to be moving thatand next is our gate security and gateis the next Frontier that we're going togo after so again these are these areinnovations that are that are you knowdata like we're using data and analyticsacross all of these to understandbehavior and influence behavior butlarge large Transformations like thesetake the whole company and a lot of bigbets had to be made here in terms ofbeing the first to start changingbehavior in the futureso like I said it's a really excitingtime at Alaska and then the next Focusareas around modern retailing how do webecome a modern retailer and not just anairline so I'm going to have Nataliecome back and talk to you about thatall rightso an airline in the cloudum we're very excited to talk about allthe things that we've done with Googlelike many Brands we are a multi-cloudcompany and when we saw sought out apartner for all of our guest facinginitiatives what we found is that wealready had a lot of tentacles in withother Google departments Google had agreat customer strength that some oftheir competitors didn't when it came toguest facing and Retail focusedSolutions so it really made them theright partner for us to build this newretailing platform and so wanted to giveyou the weeds a little bit and show youknow how we dig in with the Googlepartner team and Google Cloud Partnersis really focused on three primary areasit was first setting up a softwaredelivery platform so that we couldactually build the things then buildinga guest data engine so you saw thedigital Airline platform that charupresented connecting that with all ofthe information that we know about ourguests and also about our Shoppers soknown and unknown Shoppers becausereally being able to move people throughthe funnel connecting what we're doingwith sem with what we're doing on thesite was a really critical move becausewe're spending you know millions andmillions on getting people to our siteand we want to make sure that we'rekeeping as many people as possible goingthrough that funnel and having thatgreat retail experience with Alaska Airand so it's powering this Dynamicstorefront which is all aboutpersonalization really delivering theright offer at the right time and theright channel understanding previousexperiences that they've had like usingthe DAP so that mood meter knowing youknow maybe we don't want to talk to thisperson right now because we have delayedtheir flight five times or maybe that'sexactly why they need a hundred dollarsoff their next flight really being ableto deliver that truly personal directexperienceso when I talk about the tentacles thatwe already had with Google as we buildthis modern retailing platform whatwe're doing is stitching together a lotof different partners and work that hadalready been happening across thecompany and as tarrou said this is across-company effort this involvesmarketing e-commerce its there are a lotof teams involved I think some of thesepartners are here I see some proud spaceso ad swerve we built our machinelearning models with the ad swerve teamwe did this over covid and this wasinteresting this was driven by themarketing department and what we didthere was predictive lifetime valuemodels and so we used a bit of thedowntime in covid combined with the factthat as an airline we needed to be ascreative as possible about how weidentified who we could get back ontothe planes so we built these greatmodels that we're still using todayquantometrics is a key partner and wewant to unlock those capabilities aswell with the work that we do withGoogle Cloud then we have the guest datain the DAP and of course Google analyticanalytics so you can start to see thisis one initiative where we pull all ofthose together previously these weredistinct departments using this data indifferent ways not really using ittogether to drive decisionsand then there's a unique layer from anairline perspective with Google in thatthe underlying operational software thatpart that really Powers the airline thatpowers inventory pricing upsells part ofthat is driven by Google and so there'sthis great integration with what'scalled qpx or ITA for those of you whoknow and so this has given us againanother unique way as we talk aboutserving up the right offer Google is ina really unique position to prioritizethose offers and really deliver theright inventory in the right way for theguests to get them to engageso we're gonna pull all this together ina generative AI large language modelbecause we have to get those words infor the work that we're doing anddeliver this modern retailing platformand so for some this might not sound asmodern retail if you come from atraditional e-commerce background ifyou're selling retail you know shirtsshoes if you're a Walmart but from anairline perspective they're retailingexperience for airline has not changedin 20 years and so when we talk aboutbeing the first to sell airline ticketsin the 90s I guarantee if you looked atwhat a ticket looked like then and whatit looks like now on the site there'sprobably not that much difference thelayout might be a little bit cleaner butat the end of the day we're throwing aton of Industry information at you whenyou go to buy a ticket when at the endof the day you just want to you justwant a seat from San Francisco toSeattle and so we really want to moveinto that how do you make it a moreseamless enjoyable retail experienceso a couple of key areas that are comingone is as I mentioned natural languagesearch and I'll show you an example ofthat in the next Slide the other is thisoffer engine and really powering how wedeliver offers and so there's a reallysmall green tag at the at the top thatsays best for you so right now if you goon to an Expedia an airline site and yousite search for flights typically whatyou're seeing is it's ranked bydeparture time or Fair we want to addeverything we know about you everythingwe know about your travel Behaviorto really serve up that best fair foryou to make it very quick and seamlessfor you to get that into your cart sothat you can check out and fly we alsowant to use this information of knowingwhen you've searched for something thatperhaps you ignored it that theabandoned cart is really showing thesereal-time faresand again this is something that mightnot sound as sophisticated from at-shirt you know that t-shirt that wastwenty dollars is now fifteen dollarsbut when it comes to Airlines whereinventory and pricing are changing everysingle second to be able to get thisinformation and Stitch it together anddeliver it to someone in real time istruly truly Innovative so we're veryexcited and proud about being able to toroll this outand then in the future we really want toinject wayfinding the experience of theairport is very overwhelming for a lotof peoplehelping them with all the information weknow about where they are where they'regoing what wait times they cananticipate the way finding we think isgoing to be a huge opportunity for us sothat as you are walking over around thelobby because you don't need to go intothe lobby your device is able to clearlyhelp you take those next few steps toknow when to get to the gate to know howto get to the gate when you're in aconnection so taking everything fromGoogle Maps combined with what we knowabout our guests is really a powerfulstory to help create that better travelexperienceso natural language search one way thiscan come upand I think as we've all heard this weekthere's so many different opportunitiesand ways that natural language search isgoing to show up this example is a chatconversation but could just as easily bea voice conversation where we'reallowing people to be more fluid andflexible a very common pain point forpeople is they have a lot of miles butthey don't really know where they wantto go or they don't know how that wherethey can afford to go and so rather thansomeone having to go through and searchthis 17 times to find the right solutionwe make it a more natural conversationthe system knows how many miles you haveit knows how many what it costs to flythose miles it can really start tofilter and show you where you can getthe best deal and what's going to matchyour your interest level the best soit's very exciting coming soonso we've now gone through three of thesekey categories thank you to those of youin the room who are part of the workthat was was developed I see quite a fewof you so that's exciting but as you seeAlaska has long had the Strategicinvestment executive buy-in partlybecause of leaders primarily because ofleaders like churu who really drive thisto our Executives I promise you we donot have you know it's not as if we havea tech savvy board of directors andleadership team just looking for thistarrou really had to push and tell thesestories but you can see she's data andvery simple data in some cases you knowone of the examples she gave is the ittakes 45 seconds to print the bag tagthat's a piece of information that nowour operation leaders can understandthey can repeat it happens to be 47right now so they're really focused onwhy it's 47 and not 45 and thoseconversations I think really bridge thegap from a very operations Financefocused company with a company trying tomove technology and Innovation so Ithink it's a great case study and reallypulling those together and pushingtechnology to solve problems inenvironments that maybe are nothistorically technically innovative[Music]"
