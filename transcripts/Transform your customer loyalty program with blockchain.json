and next I hope you have seenlots of good things about AI this talkis not about AI so if you're looking forthose words surprise the last time wetalk about ityeahnot today okay so then this is the lasttime you're gonna hear about AI we'regoing to talk about loyalty programs uhand we're going to talk aboutintroduction what are Loyalty Rewardswhat are the pain points how web3 canactually help if you have a company thathas rewards and programs uh how you canhelp boost them how you can help usethem track people understand who's yourcustomer and the last thing I will betalking about is Google Cloudinfrastructure to help youso my name is Alberto I worked at Googlefor quite a bit of time I'm a directorof product management and uh here's Ryanwho's the global lead at polygon forPartnerships why don't you thinkingthank you thank you are you all able tohear me okay thumbs up how's it soundgreat so thanks so much for theintroduction it's a pleasure to be ableto present to everybodypartnership oh no good better okay justlet me know if there's any issues withthe sound so I'm the global partnershiplead at polygon Labs the growth anddevelopment team advancing the polygonblockchain helping we're scalingsolution for ethereum and I work withPartners like new bank and Starbucks andmany of the partners that are buildingweb 3 loyalty programs So today we'regoing to talk about what is that what isthe business and this is a question alot of people say what is the businessuse case of blockchain well today we'reactually going to talk about one of theactual business use cases of blockchainwe're not going to talk about the theorybut what's actually in Market where theadoption is going and we'll talk aboutsome trends for there and then we'lltake questions for you so hopefully thiswill be um interesting and fun I'm a bignerd about this topic so I think it'sfun so first of all before we jump inlet's talk about what are LoyaltyRewards before we talk about web 3Loyalty Rewards we want to Define whatour Loyalty Rewardsso a loyalty programis a marketing tool used to increaseconsumption of a product or servicewhere you exchange value in exchange forconsumption okay and it's used inmultiple Industries it's used Airlineshotels banking retail Quick Servicerestaurants you probably all we'll talkabout this later you may belong anywherefrom 15 to 18 different loyalty programsyou may not even realize how manyloyalty programs you belong to so thisis across multiple Industries andaccording to forrester's marketingresearchum 53 of business to Consumer decisionmakers are going to increase theirspending on loyalty back in 2002 we'reseeing a trend or just increase spendinghere because you can increase thelifetime value of their customer and oneof the themes we'll talk about is it'snot just about acquiring new customersbut how do you grow the lifetime valueof your existing customer base so that'sthe definition of loyalty so this isthis slide is really about why loyaltyso according to Nielsen's research 84percent of customers are willing tochoose a retailer that runs a loyaltyprogram and people will spend accordingto Forrester comar's research 3.5 x moretransactions now this makes a ton ofsense if you're getting rewarded foryour consumption maybe you use a certainAirline or a hotel you're going to keepspending there so the key takeaway ispeople want to get rewarded for theirconsumption patterns and also this isnot anything new I always every time Ifind the earliest example of a loyaltyprogram there's always something earlierso I have to keep fixing the slide theearliest one I had for a while was BettyCrocker's program in 1929 with thestamps but actually there goes back tothe 1800s with these like copper coinsit even goes back further than that andit's actually been very popular duringEconomic Times of economic hardshipthat's when loyalty programs actuallywork the best so it's an old thing it'sbeen around for a while increasesconsumption and people have a preferenceto use itso what's changed with loyalty programsand what's still the same so what'sstill the same is a loyalty programworks really well when the incrementalcost of giving away a product doesn'teat so much into the company's marginsso this this makes a ton of sense rightyou're on a Delta flight you're a Deltaloyalty customer there's an empty firstclass seat they give you that firstclass upgrade High perceived value tothe customer low cost to Delta now let'ssay you're a loyal customer of BMW andthey give you a free car great forcustomer eats into the program marginsso we don't want to have this is the bigproblem so this is a theme we're goingto come back to you don't want yourloyalty program to be a cost center ithas to be a revenue generator so loyaltyprogram margins when you talk aboutStarbucks where forty percent of theirrevenue is going through this loyaltyprogram it's all about running a highmargin high value program so it's allabout op program margins that's thething that's always been the same buthere's what's changed loyalty programoperators are trying to make theirprograms less transaction functional andmore experiential so think when you goto your local Deli let's say and you geta sandwich you get a stamp a sandwichyou get a stamp 10 stamps you get a freesandwich that's a transactional programbrands are trying to they're still doingthat but they want to have experientialprograms where they actually have builtup brand Equity over time they want totransfer that to the consumer so whatare and this comes back to the marginhow do you transfer the value of yourprogram to the consumer without eatingthe margin make it more experientialconnect the person to the brand and notjust make it a transactionalrelationship so that's what's changedand that's still that's what's still thesame about these loyalty programs nowokay that sounds great but there aresome key pain points and if I'm justcurious does anyone here is anyone herea loyalty program operator or affiliatedwith a loyalty program at their companyokay I see a couple different hands soI'm curious you'll let me know afterthis if these resonate with you arethere other pain points but based on myconversations with Brands and with someof the Loyalty program operators theseare some of the key pain points so we'regonna we're gonna do a double click intoeach one of these so the first one isthat it is getting more expensive toacquire customers customer acquisitioncosts they're saying is are up andreturn on ad spend is down for a lot ofthese loyalty program operators secondbig problem huge problem there's a lackof program engagement I talked about astat where we've seen people in 15 to 18different programs people are gettingrewards and they are not redeemingrewards so we've seen 20 rewardRedemption rates so we're going todouble click into that a second sopeople are not redeeming their rewardsthey're not engaging in the programsthree we talked about this giving awayfree products eats into the programmargins so how do you balance givingvalue with not eating too much into yourmargin so that's a difficult balancethat every loyalty program operator isstruggling to figure out how to do thatfourth Partnerships are manual and thetech lift is heavy so what's the classicstrategy to run a high margin loyaltyprogram you make a multi-company loyaltyprogram you stay a lot in Marriott let'ssay they bump you up to a very highlevel then you get a discount at the carrental company so that's where you doidentity resolution against those twocustomer lists and the status but thatcan be heavy that's a businessdevelopment effort you're doing identityresolution against new customer listprivacy okay but the status is updatingon Marriott so that's complicated to doand fifth it's hard to have a 360 viewof the customer we live in amulti-channel world you might putsomething in your shopping cart one-commerce and then go to the physicalstore do they know that you added thatto your shopping cart so how do you havethat 360 view of the customer so you canactually personalize the experiences forthe customer to drive a better customerexperience so these are some of the keypain points we're going to double clickon each of them and then we're going totalk about the blockchain solutions thatsome of the partners I'm working withare leveraging they're leveragingpolygon and gcp to be able to do thisso first of all customer acquisitioncosts are up return on ad spend is downokay why is advertising getting moreexpensive well because the deprecationof web cookies and changing Apple iOSpolicies it's harder to have data andalso with gdpr all the regulationum it is just difficult to be able topersonalize advertising at scale so youhave to it's difficult to acquirecustomers so that's why the b2cmarketers are increasing their spend onthese loyalty programs because they needto increase the lifetime value of theprograms so that's the first problemthe second problem a lack of Engagementpeople are just in too many programs andthis is also an issue of design we workwith a lot of we build a lot on polygona lot of folks are building mobile gamesand people are not getting rewards fastenough people are just not engaging intheir programs they don't realizethey're in a program they forget so thisis the engagement is super low andthat's a problem we don't necessarilywant to be 100 but we need to it has tobe higher than 20 reward Redemptionratesmargin loss I don't have to I I won't dothis a third time giving away freeproducts eat into the margins this isgoing to come back to a blockchainsolution so I'm going to keep sayingthis one because it's going to come backto L the whole strategy here but marginloss is an issue Partnerships require aheavy lift identity resolution of twocustomer lists you just got upgraded inMarriott you get upgraded to Hilton Etchow do you update the status and youhave to do the computation you have tobe able to pull that to do to be able toget the reward with the other company ifyou're doing a multi-company rewardprogram it's just a heavy lift to dothatand finally personalization is toughacross channels because you have to havethat 360 view of the customer okay sonow let's talk about some of theblockchain enabled solutions thatcustomers are using within the contextof their loyalty programs to be able tounlock higher margin and deliver valueto customers so the first one and we'regoing to double click into all of theseis when you use blockchain when you usea shared Ledger like ethereum and thenleveraging polygon and it's a scalingsolution you actually have an openstandard for multi-company Rewardsit's easier to facilitate multi-companyrewards with that open standard so we'regoing to talk about thatsecondwe've seen a really interesting statthat in the United States there are 40billion dollars of redeemable rewards ifyou think about redeemable rewards asalmost like an asset class think aboutthe stamps your points on an airlineyour points at your local hotel actuallythat there's a lot of different words ifI use a Amex credit card there are a lotof rewards which I'm not redeeming sothere's a 40 billion dollar market nowif we pause it again this is estimatebut if we pause it a 20 Redemption ratethat means there's 32 billion dollars ofunredeemed rewards in the United Statesnow we can go back and forth about theexact metric but the point is there's alot of unredeemed awards and what isblockchain really good at creating asecondary market so we'll talk about howthat might be able to increase theRedemption rates thirdthere's a concept of token gating ortoken enabling to create a 360 view ofthe customer if you have if you have annft or a token that grants you access toa certain experience you can actuallyhave a persistent view of the customerso we're going to talk about that so youcan personalize experiencesfourthin the same way that you're able toessentially token gate to personalizeexperiences you can actually useon-chain data to be able to deliverpersonalized rewards which cancircumvent the rising customeracquisition costs and the return on adspend and finally there is an ability touse decentralized autonomousorganizations to be able to havecustomers participate in governance overthe brand over certain things and we'lltalk about some use cases in the contextof corporate social responsibility howbasically you can just have moreengagement with your brandso let's talk about an open standard forstacking rewards so when you have ashared data layer polygon ethereum ablockchain where you can actually haveyour rewards on chain it makesPartnerships simple and permissionlessso you can have multiplayer Commerce nowso let's give you an example so let'ssay you have Diamond Medallion status onDelta Airlines and it's represented asan nft on the blockchain tomorrow aluxury luggage company can open aShopify Commerce store or on the GoogleCommerce store and they can tokengateand say hey if you have a diamondMedallion status from Delta as an ftwe're going to give you a 20 discount orwe're going to give you a free bag withthe purchase of another piece of luggagethey didn't have to talk to Delta to dothat Delta is accruing value to theirprogram again remember program marginsall about program margins without havingto have to do the legwork of thepartnership so when you create an openstandard you allow for permissionlessPartnerships and value accrual to yourpro um to your program think of this aslike Commerce Lego blocks all of asudden you can stack Commerce Solutionstogether accrue value to the program somy Delta status is now more valued to mebecause I now get this discountedluggage I get a discount on travel I geta discounted Hotel so you're opening upthat standard so Partnerships are simpleand Limitless for multiplayer Commercewe talked about the 32 billion dollarsecondary market for Rewards we believethat polygon Labs that this is a reallyinteresting asset class and I'll giveyou an example so after I bought aCasper mattress I then got an email fora hundred and fifty dollar gift receipta coupon to buy another Casper mattressnow I have a little bit of a bad backbut I only need one mattress so you canactually sell that on a secondary Marketto someone who's in market for that andthen you could get a cut of that so Iwould get a cut and the person whoactually wants to buy that buy themattress and be able to redeem so that'svaluable to the customer I'm actuallyusing that gift uh that coupon andthere's a person and then they'rerequiring another customer becausethat's already a liability on theirbalance sheet so this secondary Marketcould represent an interestingopportunity to address the challenge ofthe low Redemption rates and could alsobe another customer acquisition tool sothe 32 billion dollar secondary marketfor redeemable Rewardsnow let's look on the other side of thatremember I talked about if you had yourDelta Diamond Medallion status on chainyou could go to that luggage company theluggage company could token gate theirShopify store or Google Commerceexperience let's say hypothetically andgive a discount and that was good forDelta because they were accruing valueto their program it's also good forthose companies because now they canProspect into high value customers usingon-chain data so if you know someone isin a loyalty reward and reach a certainstatus you might be able to infer thelifetime value of that customer and thenyou're giving them a reward only at thepoint of purchase so this is performanceadvertising so it's not even cost CPMit's not cost per click it's not evencost per action this is cost perpurchase so that's a really interestingopportunity to be able to deliverrewards at the point of purchase ifyou're looking to prospect next newcustomers with a high LTVand then you have token gaining for aunified experience if you're able to usethat nft status at each point of thecustomer Journey you can have a more youcan be able to identify who that personis and personalize the experience forthemso the polygon loyalty Suitewithout getting too deep into theproduct roadmap we are essentially ascaling solution for ethereum we believethat ethereum is going to be thesettlement layer for the internet ofvalue so whether it's Financial usecases in-game digital assets loyaltyprogram this will be a shared settlementlayer and we believe that can unlock alot of Economic Opportunity and we scalethat we've made a billion dollarinvestment in zero knowledge technologywe have role of Technology weessentially make it faster and cheaperto be able to facilitate transactions onethereum and we're inheriting thesecurity into centralization so keytakeaway if you're new to the space ofblockchain faster cheaper to transact onethereum with polygonand with that I will pass it to discussGooglethank you thanks Ryanum so you heard a lot of terms right nowby Ryan super interesting amazingrewards I'm I hope one day we can alltrade rewards I would love to have aStarbucks coffee right now versussomeone potentially getting a newluggage from me or whatever it is thatI'm selling um anywayum so what is Google doing in this spaceand why are we talking about rewardswith polygon the first thing and Iconsider a lot of things that Googledoes are public good for example everytime you have a question you go toGoogle Search you search for for theanswer and then it translates tosomething that you kind of understandhow do you actually what is it what doesthis mean what is loyalty programs whatis polygon Labs what is ethereum what isan nft all those are questions that youoften ask to places like Google whereyou don't know what to doum so for us today what we what we'vebeen building in Google cloud is we'vebeen building infrastructure to makeblockchain very easy uh most of youmight know or might not know howblockchain works that you might know howto set up a server but it's prettydaunting uh uh one of the first thingsyou need to do when you develop anapplication which by the way most of thecoding opens in in uh in blockchain isopen source you can just copy and pasteit but then the trouble comes when youcopy paste everything and not everythingworks so the first thing that we want todo in Google is we created this and bythe way you connect to that to that codeso this thing is called node and theyare node engine I mean we at Google wecall it node engine Google blockchainnode engine and those nodes what you cando is with a simple three or four clickswhich I think I have over here on a gifyou can actually create one of thesenodes today you can create one of thesenotes in one of the uh chains calledethereum but very soon in over the nextweeks months the latest you will be ableto do that also with polygon andeventually Solana great you have yourapplication up and running what do youdo with this application now that islive the first thing you want to know isdata right and one thing that Google isvery good is that data we can get tonsof data and the good news aboutblockchain is all these data is publiclyavailable so these are when when Ryanwas talking about ledgers all theseledgers all these databases are fullyopen for anybody to look into them seewhat happens and understand how they'retreated so for example if you can seelet's say you are now Peet's Coffeewhich is also a chain over here ofcoffee that is quite popular in SanFrancisco and you like to know how isthe Starbucks doing on the pro on thepro loyalty program you can actually goand see where they have customers thatare coming back and where there's peoplethat are very interested on the Loyaltyprogram or not so one of the the thingsthat blockchains brings is publiclyavailable dataGoogle is here then to get all this datainto our into our data analysis toolsone of them is called bigquery and inbigquery you will be able to understandwith very simple questions how manytransactions did it happen today let'ssay how many transactions happen todayin Starbucks how many people redeem andall those questions then imagine you canput them together and create a lookerdashboard or put into a spreadsheet youmight not even know how to create adashboard Google has a spritzes justcreate a spreadsheet and then from thatspread so you can createum you can create your own tinydashboard or your own umyour your own graphs so that's why we'rehere uh and uh the last thing I wantedto talk about is uh in blockchain orengine how does this work so it'ssomething that we releaseumaround three months ago we had it inpreview before and what it does issimple simple UI you can choose from adrop down we have this thing called Fullnodes which allows you to accessa dedicated note for yourself or yourcompany that can actually query theseblockchains that you can understand whatis happening what traffic submittransactions sign transactions and thenwe also have archive notes another thingthat is very good about blockchains isit gives Version Control and everythingthat ever happened in a blockchain isrecorded over there it's immutable youcannot change it so for example if Itraded today my starboard rewards withthe Myriad points W is over there soMarriott can go and say oh rememberthose customers we had three years agolet me query for them let me understandwhat are they doing today at least if Ican bring them back so you actually usethese archive nodes that will providewith blockchain node engine to be ableto query them and then try to bring thembackit's going to be fully configurable wetake care of everything in terms of uhwho maintains these these systems it SREEtc we monitor them for you for yourcompany so if for whatever reason theygo down do not worry we'll have loadbalance we have all the things thatGoogle is good at in terms ofmaintaining large-scale systems and ofcourse they are Enterprise grade rightwe have all of them that you will havesupport from us you will have you canactually have a virtual privateconfigurations like if it's on premiseversus off-premise and uh we have thingslike Cloud Armor security everythingthat Google brings we are just bringinginto the blockchain and then to programto the rewardsand with that uh we would love to havefeedback from you guys we left plenty oftime for anybody who has want to askquestions whether there are publicquestions or whether you want to ask itask privately but we're very excitedabout this space and hopefully you canbuild with usthank youforeign"
