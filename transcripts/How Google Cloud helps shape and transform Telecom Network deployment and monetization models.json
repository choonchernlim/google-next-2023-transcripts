others we have here myname is Gabriela di Piazza my directorof product management here at Googlecloud and I manage the telecommunicationproducts and I would be joining stage byjochem from Deutsche Telecom weintroduced him later he's a a partner wework in our teams have been workingtogether for quite some time and I'dlike to cover some uh topics today sowhat we'll do I'll give you a bit of anintro on how we are thinkingour portfolio how we believe Cloud canhelptelecommunication companies and then weswitch to a panel we okay so we we havethe opportunity to discuss some of theaspect collaboration especially theirthinking that you Telecom is a majorprovider in uh in a major operator ingeneral so let me get goingumuh as I said so what's the pools of theindustry and what are we doing inTelecom uh I like to start fromum an interesting picture because wekeep talking about this over and overand over and over againin many things are changing but manythings are not changing right sotelecommunication industry hasobviously experienced a a relativelymodest growth there are a lot ofexceptions but if you look at thispicture and next yearit's interesting that despite thisgrowthevery carry around the world isexperiencing a massive wave of capexinvestment I would argue that theinvestment carries have to undergowhether it's in capex infrastructureSpectrum acquisition is probably one ofthe largest one and I would say probablythat the wave of not just 5G is creatingalmost an epical moment in investment inthe spaceit actually this is actually ranging notjust from a 5G Mobility but it rangesfrom you know fiber roll out roll out tofix wireless access so this uh there's amassive spend there but if we look atthe what's actually happening on thedemand side uh we keep working withcarriers and you know as we're workingdeeply into their Network build outum we start to size their data growthand data demand both from analytics butalso from a consumer perspective anEnterprise perspective so data is uhstarting to potentially double everycouple of years and it's even difficultto even size networks as you start tohave you know higher higher higherspeeds and so what's interesting thoughis that the customer experience end goalit's something also very interesting solook at this picture as a whole you haveincredible pressure on revenue and spendat the same time there is an amazingdrive to increase customer satisfactionand so I think carries our fundingitself as a topical moment right now andnot a coincidence there's a lot ofactivities even here Google next becausewe actually believe that cloud ingeneral and Cloud players can play avery important role in thistransformation and I like to discuss alittle bit how you know Google Cloudbrings to this pictureso clouds does become a catalyst forthis transformation so if you start tosee theability to think of creating new Revenueor new revenue streamsthis is uh one of the biggest Topic inthe market right now how do I createrevenue streams uh in a 5G MarketEdge Computing AIML Servicestransforming offers from connectivity tovalue-added Servicesexpand transform and operate the networkcreate new end-to-end customerexperiences we start to see some of themost Innovativeoperators around the worldnot thinking more as themselves asoperators and you know everybody talksabout the usual you know Telco to TECObut in reality you actually start tolook at where the pool of interest is infinance in banking in entertainment andso many of these players actuallytransforming themselves to become uh notjust a participant but a catalyst tothis more and more full integrated valuechainand of course there's an aspect ofsimplifying business processes I thinkyou probably all have been in thekeynote yesterday and understood how youknow there's a massive transformation inhow applications will be deployeddevelopedcollaboration AI is infused everywhereright we actually believe thatGoogle cloud has a massive set ofcapabilities both from a cloudinfrastructure data analytics securityand collaboration aspects so think aboutcloudis actually not a novelty in Telco so weworked recently with Omnia one of ourpanel analysis Maze of one of ourpartnersyou actually start to see an incredibleset of cloud presence in the carrymarket right so 64 percent of csps haveactually applied Cloud to all aspects oftheir business by 2024. and what I meanby that you start to see some of thesestats here OSS and BSS transformation issomething that actually started tohappenprobably more than three four years agoright application to SAS models use ofAI ml analytics I think it's probablyone of the largest items that we aremonitoring which is actuallytransforming from an on-prem usage to acloud-based usage and this is actuallyhappening across the board every regionevery country in every carrier migrationof B2B apps cloud-based networksEnterprise Edge Cloud so if you see thispicture and if you keep thinking of whatwe thought a couple of years agocloud has made an incredible stepforward and it's actually kind ofentrenched in many of the core areas intelecoms not just networks can be it canbe care any other aspect of B2B and b2cline of business type of of of of ofofferingsso what are we doing hereumyou heard probably many many sessions byyesterday this is a very standard GoogleCloud we tend to we have you knowsomebody this morning was asking meum can you please summarize all theannouncements from Google next to sendto our customers and I thought a littlebit about it maybe I was I just woke upand I said look it's just impossible tosummarize all this announcements becauseyesterday we heard many of them andactually you probably heard only asubset of themum but we tend to look at our presencein four major areas there's a data andAI Cloud many many examples yesterdaymodern infrastructure cloud and itdidn't happen from hosting applicationsand and transforming applicationscollaboration Cloud would you doworkspace and of course security cloudwith major Assets in cyber and so forthso this is really horizontal aspectwhere kids rely on usand I can tell you telecoms is one ofthe fastest growing verticals I've heprobably the fastest growing verticalshere at Google cloud and thenum so we started to put it in togetherto first of allstart to look at what do we actuallyneed to do to make sure our coreproducts are Telco grade from securityprivacy performance sovereigntyperspective we work in every regionevery country around the world and wecannot assume that standard itapplications are basically following thesame pattern in a telecommunicationeither Network or OSS or BSS and soforth so we actually worked across thecore groups to make sure that we haveum you know hardening across the boardobviously we chose apattern approach a pardon ecosystem youknow we could not be a a big playerwithout a pan ecosystem so the lastslide from Thomas yesterday whereyou know there was like I don't know howmany thousands of partners coming up andyou know I'm glad to see many you knowfamiliar faces here of our top Partnershere and then that's my you knowresponsibility on top of our horizontalportfoliohow can we actually build some a set ofTelco specific products and solution toaddress some core areas number one is AItransformation across the border thismight be around building personalizedexperiences uh transforming theoperations Network and anti-operationsbuilding productivity in creating newoffers and so forth I think you probablyheardmany many stories about AIS that you canapply this it'simpossible to discuss about one AI usecase in Telecom I think it actually cutsacross everythingsecond aspect is Network modernizationmajortransformation happeningvirtualization to Cloudto Edgeautomationacross the board and network whichstarts to be a combination of publicCloud hybrid and on-prem network I'lltalk a little bit more about that majorFocus here and obviously how do wepartner with carriersto help them in the monetization aspectwe cannot just be a supplier ofTechnology but if you think of Googleand alphabet in generaland the different assets that we havehow can we actually build strategies andproducts jointly with carriers in a B2Bin a B2B fashion to take them to Markethow to create new revenue streamshow to simplify custom acquisition I'llgive you an example layer of a productthat we are that we just launchedrecentlyhow can we do join go to market I cantell you that operators across the worldare becoming one of the largest GoroMarket partner for Google Cloudobviously we reach only certain amountof Enterprise customersand consumer customers operators becomea an accelerator for us and I think thisis especiallyumimportant for us because this createsreally a business relationship not asupply relationship and many of theserelationshipbasically end up being very strategic innatureand what are we doing from a productside so my focus here has been to focuson core areas how do we build a hybridtechnical Cloud infrastructure this isprobably the first Focus that we startedworking on uh three years ago we believethe network will be a hybrid in naturewe introduced core products such asGoogle distributed Cloud as an exampleto make sure that we would bring thecloud infrastructure from Google onpremise with the right performanceacceleration and characteristics andthis was by design a core investmentthat we made interesting this was abrand new product that was actuallythought starting from theTelecommunications industrybut then interesting enough is youprobably saw from the keynote evenyesterday it's applicable to many manyother marketssecond aspect isumwe believe there's a major Gap in theautomation or how a network evolvesand we want to infuse our knowledge andresearch and investment of many manyyears from having builtnot just kubernetes platforms but alsohaving built the largest Network in theworld and where we basically manage ourGoogle Global Network in a fully intentdrivendeclarative with declarative approachand so this is another area that we arefocusing on andum something new I like to cover todayNetwork planning is also taking a a newturn in this moment and I want to showyou a couple of assets that we have interms of how can we use the power ofGoogle including Google Maps andgeospatial intelligence in helpingthrough the planning processand last but not leasthow can we help on the customerexperience sidethink of combiningthe ability to understandcustomer usage from Android phones onone sideto being able to partner with data forexample with Google marketing platformGoogle marketing assets so combiningthese things together would bring theopportunity to actually create a set ofcampaigns for new customer acquisitionupsell cross-sell retention and so forthand so a couple of examples we I talkedabout the network and we have been on apath as I mentioned we needed to bringa high performancesolution to run this network and that'swhy we actually started you know acouple of years ago but now we are on apath ofadding the same type of functionalityacross Google Cloudas well as on-premise capability andadding layers of Automation and a dataanalytics Foundation we actually believethere won't beany network in the future that will notspan across those three layersand obviously what we're looking for thefuture iswe've been talking for a while about acloud native Networkbut the reality is that we start to laythe foundation for what we call an AInative Networkif you start to see from the demosyesterday ability to potentiallypredict and and describe whereapplication could runhow you could describe some of thenetwork intentmoving from a reactive to proactive typeof issue isolation and so forth so thisthis is a a huge area of of I thinkresearch I think this will keep us busyfor the next five to ten yearsand a couple of other examples Imentioned your spatial intelligence soif you think of the assets that Googlebrings to to Marketum we have probably the more uhcalibrated models in terms of every timeyou open up Google Maps you see a bluedot so three billion of things everysecond so we look at propagation we lookat understanding assets and we believethese area set of assets that we have not exposedto the telecommunication world but theseare assets that can be played acrossmobile networks to fix networks andwe'll have a chance to discuss a littlebit later we all can as welland I mentioned uh subscriber insightsimagine now combiningGoogle's data analytics capabilitiestapping into customer usageunderstanding consumptioncombined withthe ability to do demographics andtargeting using Google marketing andpotentially targeted campaignsbut also close the loop instantly andactivatedata plans through either Android phonesor or iPhones so this is not just aboutan offline analytics capability but theability to actually bring thesecapabilities all together so these arejust few examples that I wanted to touchonum and then the last slide I promiseI like to think of Google not justas another hyperscalerif you think of each one of our productsin Telecom we are tapping into anincredible amount of Assets in alphabetGoogle alphabetI mentioned Google distributed cloudyou know we are using the same exactlife cycle management Fleet Managementprovisioning automation software that weuse in4000 plus location the YouTube Networkand so this is an example of how wetapped into this type of researchTelecom Network automation all theintent driven design is something thatwe've been using in Google GlobalNetwork for the last 10 plus yearsplanning I just you know I was justshowing you some of the assets that webasically can leverage from ourgeomapping and Google Maps team Telecomsubscriber insights again tapping intoGoogle marketing tapping into Android soI'm trying to communicate here is thatwhen we start to build productswe're not trying we are trying to buildthe next powerful compute platform andso forth but we're actually think youknow what is really differentiated aboutGoogle the other hyperscalers cannotbring to Market and so we really like tothink of this as eitherleveraging technology that we have builtfrom a planet scale infrastructurebut also how can we leverage uhEnterprise and consumer assets to buildeffective go to market uh products thatcan actually help Telco with top revenuestreamsso with thisI like to invite Joachim here on stageumand yoga means vice president forNetwork Automation in Deutsche Telecomand yeah yeah if you see thereyou can why don't you uh maybe give us abit of an introve yourself and I thinkwewe also have a a slide about whoDeutsche Telecom is it shouldn't be aneed of you knowsure yeah first of all things gotcreated for introducing me on the uhkind welcome here I'm really honored tobe here it's a pleasure uh amongst allthis uh competence it's very impressiveto be here on this conference I can sayumfor those of you who are not familiarwith Deutsche Telecom I compiled acouple of key facts maybe just a quickoverview Deutsche Telecom is one of theworld's largest Telecommunicationscompanies with presence in more than 50countries by Revenue we are Europe'slargest telecommunications company and Iwon't read out all these facts to youbut one of the things that is importantto understand also for this discussion Ithink is that we embarked on a journeywhat we call the digital Telcotransformation so our ambition is tobecome the world's leading digital Turcoand a lot of what we will be discussingtoday has to do exactly with that withthat Targetmy personal responsibility is I run thegroup's Network automation program inthat program we are focused on definingand driving key enablers for automatingour networking processes along theentire value chain of planning buildingand operation operating networks ofcourse with the goal basically withthree major goals to increase speedto increase efficiency and of coursealso to at the same time to increasecustomer experienceso yeah well great and what I what um Iwas impressed joking but thanks to therelationship you know that we announceduh a year overgo is that getting closerto Telecomtheir brand is one of the highest brandin Europe it's very interesting sobecauseI think they they're actually able toproject an incredible brand ofinnovation and and so forth so one Imean I like to start I obviously I hadto do it I'm in a cloud provider rightsoum but we think that cloud isrelevant for all the aspects that Italked about there's an aspect oftopics of expressure there's an aspectof supporting build out of new Servicestransition of networkanalytics so what are your thoughts Imean how do you see Cloud becoming partof uh you know building the DeutscheTelecom Network and services so a verygood question first of all as itpertains to my own field of activity thenetwork automation I think one of thethings we do there is we leverage a lotof knowledge that and capabilitiespractices that have been built in thecloud world over the last many years thelast decades basically and apply them toour Network operating processes and as Imentioned this initiative the programaround leading digital Telcowe are in the middle of implementingthat and when it comes to Cloud the keything to understand is what we set outto do is basically breaking theclassical vertically integratedoperating model of our Network Servicesapp and transforming that into ahorizontal cloud based modeland many of the architectural paradigmsin that cloud architecture are probablynot new to this audience at all so ifyou would look in it you would find thatit has to do with basically breaking uptightly coupled software architecturesand creatingNetwork capabilities exposed by apismachine consumable apis which is a reprequisite prerequisite for automationright but then other than the runtime wealso and that is something my team and Iwere deriving over the last two yearsvery intensely we're also looking intohow actually people work with thoseenvironments and there we set up aprogram around the network lifecyclemanagement by harmonizing on a commoncicd tool chain for entire networkoperations across at least Europe andfootprint so far and that will enable usof course to do the shift left approachYeah by bringing much more securitycontrol points quality checks testingvery early on in the life cycleso that is one area where we are havebeen focusing on over the last 18 monthsto implementon the way forward things we arecurrently driving are coming I wouldcall network data architecture basicallyan entire layered architecture thathelps tofree up data from text silos and makingit available across the organization notjust technology but also outside thetechnology organization to be consumableas products by all sorts of analyticsapplications of real-time non-real-timeanalytics and of course on top of thatto do this analytics obviously we wouldneed an mlops layer to be able to withrepositories with ML pipelines to beable todrive this in a actually industrializedway if you will so those are those arethe key I would say those are keyelements of of this transformation wecurrently do with clouds andwe already see the effects the positiveeffects of that in areas where wealready went through this transformationso life cycle area upper life cycle areawe go through that transformationjourney and we already see in the areaswhere we applied it uh really reallygood effects be it radically reducedcycle times for releases at the sametimes reduced change failure ratesbut also uh you know significantlyincreased efficiency for the teamsworking with those actual Landscapesyeah I like thewhat you describe a shift left rightbecause this is a I think the more wework withoperators in this last couple of years II'm surprised myself about the change inmindset because this uh way of thinkingis starting to actually be uh ingrainedas opposed to you know keep addingadditional system I think I think Ifound that this is a moment wherethere's also a company-wide thinkingabout unified data platforms unifiedAutomation in responsible for unifiedCSD pipelines and then we we show up andwe think we know a lot as you knowhyperscalers of the company so four butactually the Telecom is alreadyundergone this process and so we need tomake sure that we keep innovating thereright so in general so if you think ofof cloud same question would pause aboutanalytics you know it's in the subjectin the title bar presentation herein analytics is not a new thing in thetelecoms it's been there for quite sometimebut I actually think it is also at oneof those moments where analytics playHero what are you thinking about so howdo you say analytics play in this inthis market right so it's it's a youknow obviously a vast field I I can'tthink of any process in our value chainthat won't be affected by or is not orwill not be affected by by analytics andsome data-driven analytics in some wayum the most obvious one I described whenwe look into the classical type ofnetwork operationscontributing ultimately the customerexperience I want to be able to do anormal detection I want to be able whenthings go wrong to understand where theroot cause is soa data-driven approaches MLA AIapproaches to understand very fast wherethe root cause is is of courseactivities or areas where we look intowhat we Implement and ultimately theultimate goal will be uh to predict toeven predict uh failures or incidentsbefore they actually impact the customerso that's the Holy Grail I would say ofwhat we are trying to accomplish tocatch those incidents uh early on tomake sure nothing impacts the customerbut other than that I think that that isa focused area that cloud operators havebeen looking in for probably alsodecades nowum and also and by the way also ourtoday's Network operation with ourvendors they bring with them analyticsBased on data in the stack to be able toassure the system the stabilityEtc so that is nothing new but then ifyou look at another area which is quiteinteresting from a addressable spendspent potential and from an efficiencypotential something that is easilyoverlooked is the plan and build processright so as part of that leading digitaltechnical strategy we are investingheavily in network infrastructure so ofcourse the capex allocated there and theFTE the Opex are located there there's ahuge leverage effect if you're able toinvest capex more smartly if you're ableto squeeze out percentage points in uhWorkforce efficiency for those processesto build those networks so this is whyfor instance in Germany a couple ofyears ago we already invested inml based image recognition for for roadsto be able to accelerate and make moreaccurate ourum our fiber planning processand with uh you guys right now in ourPOC we are trying to even increase thesecurity and increase the speed of thateven more by consuming uh Geointelligence via apis in the long run sothose are ideas so the things we dotogether as part of our extendedInnovation partnershipyeah and I think analytics is one ofthose topics that umit never stops of funding new use casesabsolutely theum so if you look back at the uh at thepartnership the relationship we've madedifferent announcements we've beenworking with themwhat was interesting for me is thatwe're working on different tiers uh withDeutsche Telecom we work with existingproducts future products Innovation andso forth uh you know maybe take usthrough some of the experience and someof the Milestones that's uh you knowthat we've been working together just toyou know get a feeling of of differentthings yeah so so one area which arewhich you are very aware of where whichis not my personal area ofresponsibility but where we in thepartnership Deutsche Telecom and Googlereached a significant Milestone earlierthis year was the deployment of a 5Gcore on a GDC on-premise so uh with thatwe could show that deployment times ofuh core functions we could accelerate uhbringing deployment times down tobasically moments yeah so that issomething that has been already achievedby beginning of the yearum in our um and and regarding this Ithink looking forwardit is very important that that we investin I would sayum as part of that partnership increating industry blueprints yeah forum simplifying uh this type of workloaddeployment and operation uh to make itscalable yeah to to deploy it at scalelater on so umthat is that is one area where I thinkuh achievements are there and where thepotential is for harmonization andbringingum Automation and these type of types ofthings at scale into Telco in lots oflearnings on our side by the way becausewe are Google is you know technologycompany you know fantastic engineeringbut then it's been in this journey weactually uh that's what was interestingfor us having a a joint Journey where wecould actually understand the needs it'snot just a piece of technology but it'sthe part of operation the aspect ofsovereignty the hospital security and soforth is was great learning from uson the second thing on the um Roadsurface recognition on thegeo-intelligence I have to be a bitcautious here but we are in the processwe are in the POC we will have earlyindications by September time framewhich is soon but I can say that uhearly steps look quite promising so weare looking into of course comparing theAPI based Geo analytics withum with the accuracy of the of the thecrown truths data we have from ourcurrent solution so uh here uh the firstindications not quite look quitepromising so I'm quite positive on thatandum and and one of the things I thinkwhere the entire industry at not ourpartnership in particular but theindustry at large uh where there's Ifeel there's a lot of potential isapplying these sort of Geo intelligentsolutions to a variety of umprocesses especially labor and capitalintense processes in deploying Networkservicing networks all of those willdepend on correct asset dataalso those things will benefit fromhavinggeo-intelligence data and assetintelligence data available basically atyour fingertip yeah as opposed to whatwe do today we send out cars we collectour own pictures our own images if I hadit by an API why wouldn't I use it yeahso that is an area of big potential forradio planning for fiber planning forservice processes and I think it is alsoa correct asset inventory data I wouldsay lays the ground for everythingaround that big topic of digital twinyeah without what is it without acorrect asset inventory yeah you can'tyou shouldn't basically talk aboutdigital twin if you don't get the basicsright so I think there is that's that'sthe nearest area where I see potentialand um but by the way weum without getting ahead of ourselvesbut we do see a lot of applicability tomany Industries as well of coursebecause obviously whenever you discussyou know radio planning is a veryTelecom specific aspect but assetintelligence surface build and so forththis is something that uh we believe canbe applicable to energy Transportationcities and so forth yeah many manyothers I think there's a lot ofpotential here what uh I what a goodlearning is also thatum in in these projects it is extremelyimportant you have the right domainexperts who have the local businessunderstanding the context of thesituation available already in the facewhere you basically prepare the data forthe analytics you do that that's I thinka common commonrules in all sorts of AIML projects butthe close collaboration between thedomain experts and the data AI experts Ithink is is absolutely essential foreach individual case you do because evenon the surface they look similar thereare tiny differences that actually makethe difference then in practice so youactually need to have that strongcollaboration between guys like you witha strong data and AI expertise and ourdomain expertise in the in the concretebusiness context and that's acombination of the partnership we and bythe way we don't want to make itexclusive the point is that how can weactually many discussions with with DThas been how can we create this and makeit available because in reality I see anincredible amount of increasedcollaboration between carriers thelearnings can be applied across and soforth that's been an interesting aspecteven the you know the openness in makingsure that certain things could be sharedso thank you so much and thank you againfor yourself[Applause]foreign"
