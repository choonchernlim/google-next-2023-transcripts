platform in the securitybusiness I look after our regulatedCloud Solutions and I'm really excitedto chat with you today today I have myfriends ashleya and Ganesh do you mindintroducing yourself briefly absolutelyhi I'm Ashley Parish I am with Equifaxand I run our Google Cloud platform aswell as our Cloud engineering teams thatrun our Global our global scale for theEnterprise excellent hi everyone my nameis Ganesh janaki Raman I had a platformengineering at broadcom with a verysimilar profile is what Ashley has itthank youwe are thrilled to talk to you todayabout shirt workloads and compliancewithout compromise I am super excited tobe up here it's very fun to be actuallyon stage live for the first time in afew years so excited a little bitnervous too so bear with us all right soassured workloads when I joined Googleabout seven years ago they told me I wasgoing to work on compliance I was like Iguess I do plans it turned out to be thebest thing I can possibly do I love thiswe get to learn where all the securityWorks in Google Cloud how everythingoperates I get to understand theplatform inside and out and it's been alot of funand along that Journey we startedworking on things like fedramps siegesIris 1075. we'll get into the details ofthat in a few minutes but really what wefound is we had to start thinking aboutcompliance differently and some of thechallenges that we're facing right nowis how do we keep up with what's goingon in the world regulations are changingquickly and we need to move into aproactive rather than a reactive stancefrom a client compliance perspectivewe've really been making some changes tothat additionally we've also beenlooking at some of the problems that ourcustomers face with traditional govclouds now we actually did our first govcloud back in 2010 so we've actuallybeen in this business for a long time alot of folks don't really understand howwe grew and changed from thatperspective and when we started lookingat the problem of gov clouds we wantedto solve the problem of limited limitedcapacity we wanted to solve the problemof the velocity of services into theenvironment we also wanted to make it alot easier for customers to gain accessto the environment and reduce the totalcost of ownership relative to runningthose workloads so we invented a newtechnology called software-definedCommunity Cloud sdcc as we like to useacronyms for everything is thecapability that's kind of driving ourgov Cloud solution our government Cloudsolutionand assured workloads is the productthat we built along those lines and welaunched it uh about three years agoactually and we've been in productionfor some time and this is the productthat allows our customers to gain accessto things like fedramp high uh like Imentioned sieges itar which we'll talkabout briefly in a few minutes as wellas impact level five for our DODcustomers as well we're going to talkabout that in more detail here in a fewminutes but the idea is to reallysimplify the experience of gainingaccess to those regulated CloudSolutions and those government Cloudofferings reduce that total cost ofownership like I mentioned we've gotconsistent apis so our customers areable to just as easily access theenvironment from the commercialcapabilities as well as the governmentcapabilities really makes it a loteasier and reduces that costsignificantly by having a single supplychain for your software rather thandifferent Supply chains for each of yourgovernment customers that you need towork withand it also reduces that compliance toilit makes it a lot easier to achieve theoutcomes that we're shooting for withour customers and really that's whatwe're shooting for with the shortworkloads is we want to have this jointJourney we want to make sure that you'rewe're helping you out along the path togetting your compliance off the off yourchecklist to make it a lot easier togain access to the environmentokay so to do that there's a couplecontrols that we've built to help alongthose ways so assured workloads uh againthe idea here is to gain access to thatenvironment quickly and easily there's ahandful of controls that make it a loteasier the first is enforcement ofcompliance products one of the thingsI've heard from a lot of customers whenthey're working on gov Cloudenvironments is they accidentally usenon-compliant products a lot of timesresulting in a spill of data intoapplications infrastructure where itshouldn't be and this was one of thefirst problems we took on and we createdthis resource usage restrictioncapability which makes sure that youcan't accidentally use a non-compliantproduct when you're working with yourgov cloud or government customers thenext is personal access this is a reallybig one and can be a really complicatedtopic for our customers actually this isone of the ones that we had some of thebiggest challenges at Google becausewe've built our infrastructure andtalent from the ground up to supply ourcustomers with the security andcapabilities that they're looking forbut a lot of our customers especially ingovernment and regulated sectors requirethat their people have certaincapabilities or restrictions to them interms of accessing from specificGeographic locationsspecific Personnel access controls maybedifferent background checks in theexample of sieges and a handful of othercapabilities so we went off and solvethis Personnel access problem and alongwith that we launched assured support Soassured support allows you to still havethat 24x7 response to your tickets andhave compliant capabilities for that sofor example with our govcloud customersour assured workloads customers they'lluse the US persons control so we'll makesure that if your support ticket comesin it's a US person that handles thatfrom top to bottom throughout thatentire experienceand finally enforcement of that datalocation data locations such an you knowimportant topic for a sovereign andgovernment government supply chaincustomersso making sure that we've got strongcontrols that really make it easy and ifyou're you know using uh US Governmentyou speak the language of conus which ismy least favorite acronym of all timebecause it doesn't make any senseum so anyway you put it in conus thatdata has to be in the United States sothe enforcement of that data locationallows you to meet those regulatoryrequirements and Achieve those outcomesfor your customersall right so what does that mean a wholemouthful of compliance uh acronyms nowthe capabilities we've launched over thelast couple years these are allavailable in GA today by the way sothese are highly accessible to you EUregions in support with Sovereigncontrols uh my my good leader and archaspoke earlier this morning about theSovereign capabilities so if you cancheck out her recorded session uhAustralia regions in support So allowingour customers to gain access to hcf andirap workloads in Australia Israeliregions in support another strongimportant capability for our IsraelicustomersCanadian regions in support whichincludes Canada protected B capabilitiesso again really opening that up and thenin the United States of course a wholebunch here we see the healthcare andLife Sciences with HIPAA High trustfedramp moderate which has over 100services that are capable of supplyingyour capabilities there uh fedramp highof course the high water mark for a lotof our federal and civilian agencycustomers uh fips 140-2 this actuallyyou know we geek out on this one for aminute because I love encryption uh oneof the things when we set out to do thisif you well shoot when I joined Googlemy second week here I had a meeting withoars and uh we were talking about Phipps140-2 crypto we're like well we need Xnumber of dollars to do it for thefedramp environment and he's like whydon't you just do it for everything sowe did uh so we put Phipps 140-2validated crypto across the entireinfrastructure you can't not use fips140-2 validated crypto which makes itagain if you're working in this publicsector supply chain that's a big issuereally hard to solve we made it veryvery easy it reduces that total cost ofownership makes it a lot easier to usethose compliant workloads in productionuh and then of course a whole bunch ofNest standards uh you'll look for yourfavorite up there but there's a wholebunch more of course uh whenever you dofederal monitor fedramp High there's awhole bunch of nist capabilities thatyou have access toum and then of course one of my one ofmy favorites here is itar because Istarted working on itar five years agoum and it's exceptionally difficultbecause this is a regulation instead ofcompliance framework and I'm reallyproud to share that we have launched aproduction uh to GA itar in the lastyear and we've expanded those servicesthis summer to include things likebigquery and some new capabilities forthe user interface so if you have itarneeds this is a really importantcapability impact level 2 for our DODcustomers this is roughly equivalent tofedramp moderate even though the dod hasa few extra capabilities required withthe fars and a handful of othercapabilities with cmmc and then il-4impact level 4 and also we're reallyexcited about impact level five this onereally is a proof point in our journeytowards accrediting our software-definedcommunity cloud and the approach thatwe've taken to to get that across theFinish Line we worked very closely withour partners in the government to makesure that we have the isolation controlsin place to achieve this accreditationand really opens up a broad spectrum ofofferings for our customers that areinterested in supplying the defensedepartment U.S regions in support thisis kind of a catch-all that a lot of myEnterprise customers really like toenjoy that allow us to comply with thosecontrols but also decouples necessarilyfrom a compliance frameworkand then finally see just see just wasalso a really fun one to work on becauseyou have to have these fingerprintbackground checks by the FBI andcarrying around a briefcase and allsorts of fancy stuff uh so we did seejust over the last couple years as welluh and again that really helps us withcustomers that are working in state andlocal especially uh and also of coursewith law enforcement and then of courseIRS 1075 this one also tends to comethrough for state and local customersbut we also see in other areas forfinancial services where this isimportantokay uh and again I kind of mentioned oralluded to sovereignty the sametechnology that we use to build ourgovernment capabilities and our U.Spublic sector supply chain are the samecapabilities we also are using toachieve our Sovereign Cloud outcomes andI have some Partners here today thathave been working with me on that like Imentioned Archen presented earlier thismorning on this and this is a reallyreally key capability the way we've usedsovereignty is across these three areasdata operational and software for datasovereignty that's something that youcan work with us to supply and we dothat with a handful of controls thatI've already mentioned but one extrafrom an encryption perspective datalocation very very important for ourdata sovereignty customersuh personal access controls making surethe right people are supporting yourCloud environment and then we also offerexternal Key Management with key accessjustification that allows you to achievethose those data sovereignty outcomes uhand again all built on that samesoftware-defined Community Cloudtechnology what's really cool about thisis you get to build workloads for yourU.S public sector customers and buildthe same thing for your Europeancustomers with Sovereign sensitiveworkloads again reducing that complexityand cost of being able to supplysoftware capabilities in Cloud to all ofyour regulated customers globally andthis is really the journey we're onoperational sovereignty is also reallyimportant for us so on the operationalsovereignty Spectrum we're working withour partners like I mentioned there's afew here today so if you're interestedin that come talk to me afterward I'llconnect you with some cool people andoperational sovereignty allows us towork with local Partners to achievedifferent Sovereign outcomes and thenfinally finally software sovereignty wedo have products that are capable onthis spectrum as well and softwaresovereignty is a really tricky one thisis hard this is where you typically seeair gapped environments and of course wedo have operating offerings that allowair-gapped capabilities as well againcome chat with me afterward if you havequestions on that but if you're talkingabout compliance today especially USpublic sector you might have questionsabout jwcc and some of the othercapabilities that the U.S government'slooking forso that's really the spectrum that weplay with in terms of data sovereigntyoperational and software sovereignty andhow it's built on the exact sametechnology we're using for governmentCloud customersall right so with that I'm going to winddown and talk a little bit less and lookto my friends here on stage thank youagain so much for joining me today sofor starters let's talk to Ashleyhi guys so um we know in the intro Imentioned a little bit about what I doat Equifax we are obviously up here froma platform engineering perspective ifyou think about that in addition toplatform engineering I also lead ourCloud transformation and it's somethingthat we are very diligent about tocontinue doing everything we can in thecloud security space to continue toincrease our security posture and all ofthose thingsum you know I'm also a stakeholder forour compliance and um and what you wouldconsider governance and what I callplatform architecture so there'sarchitecture spread across but what wehave to do with our org structure andwhat we have to do with all of ourworkloads really matter soawesome thank youum Ganesh I know you entered briefly butmaybe you can go a little bit deeperbriefly sureum I mean I had the platform engineeringat broadcom So when you say platformengineering we're essentially talking ofall the design architecture buildingthose uh core foundational pieces thatincludes infrastructure like networksecurity uh also includesthe kubernetes orchestration layer whichis kind of uh bread and butter for us werun most of our services in gke so thethat orchestration layer is also part ofthe platform and we also offer variousfoundational services on top of that saywhat we call this kubernetes operatorsthese are like stateful services that weoffer databases elasticsearch Kafka Etcthat our SAS Services can consume sothat's what my team does as part ofplatform engineering thank you Ganeshall right so uh let's start with youAshley so can you tell us a little bitwell you already did this a little bitmore but let's go a little bit more intoEquifax itself if that's okay absolutelyso um you know I mentioned a little bitabout my role but what Ganesh justtouched on uh there's also a hugecomponent that I touch and that me andall of my teams uh you know areresponsible for around when we sayfoundational controls right so thatBaseline configuration infrastructure iscode policy is code and anything that wehave to account for so that we ensurewhen we do hand off Cloud environmentswe're trying to give as much as possibleas a default so that you know ourapplication teams and our developers andEngineers only need to worry about whatthey have to do in addition to thatthere's also you know Equifax as acompany where a global data analyticsand technology company and we're also acredit agency so if you think aboutRegulatory workloads and thecomplexities that those bring to thetable there's a huge part of it but wealso play it back into our EquifaxMission which is to live your financialbest so all things that we do kind ofwrap around that you know overarchinggoal for how we're running not only ourfor our customers but also what we'redoing at the foundational layer yeahthat's awesome and thank you so muchI've been working with your team for thelast couple years and it's been anabsolute honor to help you on thatJourney uh okay so next question herecan you talk to us a little bit moreabout how you're using Google cloud andsome of the products uh around thoseservices that you're you're supplyingabsolutely so um if you think aboutwhere we started in Cloud transformationand where we've landed we actuallyrolled out gcp back in 2019 and werolled it out as our Enterprise platformso Google is a data platform and it wasintended to you know really cater tothose needs and we definitely latched onto that as Equifax all things revolvesaround data so you know we rolled it outas our Enterprise platform and then wealso are ensuring that even though weare multi-cloud we're being veryprescriptive about what needs to live inwhich Cloud platform rightum and then on top of that if you talkabout Services we're probably using thesame Services as others you know we'vegot bigquery you've got big table CloudSQL Cloud functions dataproc dataflowall of those kind of standard what Iconsider our core services but thenanother big one is VPC service controlsso that equally probably three yearsmaybe maybe 2019 rolled out as well andbut that also kind of became anadditional layer that Equifax attachedto for us to have a second layer ofcontrol for data exfiltration so we kindof we've been able to look at VPCservice controls Beyond kind of how itstarted and identify areas where weultimately don't use a service unlessit's supported and that just even thoughwe've got our own Equifax controlscompensating controls it provides anadditional layer of security protectionawesome thank youum and then keep on talking to us alittle bit about the regulations thatwere on the journey with youyeah so when we talk about you knowregulatory workloads I know youreferenced some of them on the slidewe've got fedramp we have sieges andthere's but there's you know textureramp and all of the other ramps rightthere's a lot in that listum and as a whole we've been able tolook at assured workloads to identifywhat controls does it already give us ontop of what we already have and thereare a few where they overlap right we'realready accounting for it but it doesn'thurt to have a secondary layer of thatcontrol on the Google sideum so you know we alsoobviouslyum it's touching all things U.S publicsector and we talked about sieges that'sa little bit new to us uh based off offof an acquisition but we are you knowcontinuing to get our feet wet in thatspace and figure out not only what wewould need to do for our sharedworkloads for sieges but also fedrampand if there's any ability to kind ofconsolidate some of those objectivesaround our controls yeah that makessenseum and then uh Ganesh let's go to you uhand do you mind tell us a little bitmore about kind of what your team does Iknow you did in the intro but maybe adouble click on that sureum maybe a little bit intro of thecompany itself right so broadcom is afairly large enterprise software companypeople recognize us for what we've donein the Silicon semiconductor space butwe are a very large enterprise softwarecompany as well we've been acquisitiveand we've been buying companies for thelast five years and we have a wideportfolio of products both anon-permanent SAS so where our GoogleJourney kind of started was adoptingGoogle as our SAS platform as afoundation of SAS platform that's howour journey started where we went aheadwith the large transformation exercisefor SAS yeah where we not justre-platform we kind of uhcontainerized applications made themmore microservice friendly things likethat and then moved it into the GoogleCloud right so so from that perspectiveuh we've been on the SAS Journey inGoogle for about four years now andalmost all of our SAS Services runinside Google so this is a largeportfolio of many industry-leadingsolutions consumed by all the Fortune500 if you will and because we have somuch of customer data it's uh extremelysensitive for the security perspectiveso from a security complianceperspective it's really critical for usthat we are in this journey particularlywith azure workloads yeah it's been it'sbeen really fun working actually withboth of you both of your teams on thisjourneyum and actually I remember presentingroadmap of achieving sieges and impactlevel five and all this stuff years agoto finally be here together is reallyfun it's really excitingum do you mind telling us a little bitmore about how you're using gcp and whatare some of the products and servicesyou're using sure again GCE the computerengine of course is uhMainstay butmost of our SAS Services almost all ofit run inside kubernetes gke so gke iscore to us right so we also consumeseveral other services from Google onthe on the enamel side bigquery say forexample data proc uh now vertex AI sobut it was gke is foundational toeverything that we do in SAS yeahexcellentcool well uh let's sell Oh wrong buttonsorryum so do you mind tell us a little bitmore about the regulations and whatwe're working with for some of yourfederal customers sure soum we have uh customer data all over theplace and as I said that kind of puts usin a spot where we need to be compliantso we've been doing stock two for forages now we do ISO we also have aservice where we do PCI DSS that's forwell over a decade now we've been doingPCI DSS no PCA 3DS for a long time nowuh for our federal customers it's uhfedramp is a mandatory compliance we'vebeen uh Federal compliant for uh I thinkfor about four to five years now uhstarted off with Federal moderate nowwe're in the Journey of doing FederalEmpire for some of the products we arealso doing impact level four for one ofthe products for our DOD customers yeahso we are big into this because all ourwe will be trying to get all ourproducts intobecause we have a lot of federalcustomers excellent well it's uh it's sofun working with you on that I know it'sbeen been quite the journeyum how's assured workload specificallyhelping your team and what you're doingon this journey to get there from abusiness perspective uh I should workbecause there's been a a great bone Ithink Ashley uh touched upon this oneright soum our customers are U.S governmentagencies for us it's really importantabout this us person U.S soil we need tomake sure that only the people with theright clearance have access to theinfrastructure so right off the bat weinherit so many controls of measuredworkloads that helps us in the Journeyof Journey of certification we all knowhow hard it is to go through this rightyeah uh the U.S on the data residencypart which you covered in yourpresentation as well uh CJ right sothat's very important too and assuredworkloads gives us the guard rails tomake sure that we consume the rightServices because not all services are atthe same level of certifications aboutmedium high aisle for rightmake sure that we have the rightServices also make sure that we use theright regions right so the data is notexfiltrating out to somewhere that wherewe have a problem right so I should worktowards gives us the right guard railsto make sure that not only forcertification but for us to run goneright Beyond certification sure we needto make sure that we are we are withinthe within the compliance and so on andso that's the first part the second partprobably more uh interesting moreimportant to us from an engineeringperspective is that we have built afairly large commercial platform yeahwhere all of the SAS services that werun are in the TCP platform so it'sreally important for us that we have andidentical but independent platform rightso uh what I mean by that is the sameset of configurations that I have thesame capabilities that I get theservices should behave the exact sameway right that's what I get in a inAzure workloads also making sure that itis compliant so for purely from anengineering perspective it gives me theconsistency yeah I have I'm able tostandardize my automation I don't createa snowflake yeah just to just tomaintain a better environment right soit's exactly the same my commercialenvironment is exactly the same as myfederal environment from a businessperspective that helps me as wellbecause as I said all of these servicesare running in fast today sowhen it comes to Federal ramp the timeto certify uh is kind of time to marketright so I have this service alreadyrunningif it if I run this in in Azureworkloads I can get them to Market veryquickly that gives me a Competitive Edgein that in this space yeah as I said wearefederal compliant for some of theproducts uh we are in the il-4 journeyalong with you and hopefully we we getthere in the next few quarters actuallyexcellent yeah I love what you weresaying there about the consistency youknow that was one of the lessons welearned the hard way honestly wasrunning bespoke government environmentsreally led to a lot of problems andDrift from a security perspective andyou know when we set out to build ashared workloads that was one of thethings we wanted to do but I love thatyou're saying that because our goal wasto share that same experience and try toensure that our customers didn't have togo through that pain of having differentenvironments for different outcomes soI'm really happy it's workingdon't accessexcellent well thank youum well cool well with that I'm going totalk a little bit about what's new andwhat's coming up uh so of course I'malways really excited about what to talkabout what my team's working on uh so acouple new capabilities and new featuresuh one that we're launching actuallythis month right now uh is resourcelevel monitoring one of the things thatwe're doing with assured workloads islike Ganesh mentioned we're working onguardrails right and I would put theseinto the box of preventative controlsright when I geek out on complianceso we stack as many preventativecontrols into the front end of assuredworkloads when you're bootstrapping butwe also have detective controls so wemonitor the environment for drift andany problems that might be popping upfrom a compliance perspective to helpwith the kanban journey and also justhelp with compliance in general we knowthese things happen of course preventionis the key but you have to be able todetect and respond as well so with thatwe've added resource level monitoringit's a really cool capability we've hadmonitoring for a while but now we godeeper and we get down to the actualresources in your resource hierarchy sowe've launched that recently as wellfree trials we've been doing this for alittle while one of the challenges withcompliance is always getting started soone of the things we've been trying todo is simplify the experience and we'velaunched free trials recently so pleasecome and get a free trial we're givingthose out TLS version restrictionactually this originally came fromfedramp but also PCI DSS and as you canimagine for hyperscale cloud provider welove TLS and in fact one of theco-authors on the TLs 1.0 papers on ourteam which was really exciting for mewhen I joined Google but anyway so a lotof the compliance Frameworks requireensuring that you have the right TLSversion for your environment and we'velaunched a new policy that allows you tomake sure that's in place and preventsyou from accidentally using the wrongTLS policy super useful PC for PCI DSSand also super useful for fedrampthey're very very picky about that alongwith fips they love TLS and they lovefips so those are the two areas we'veworked on that we've been working onimproved confidential computeintegration and some members from ourteam are talking about confidentialcompute this week super cool technologyI'm a big believer so if you get achance go check out those sessions andthenmove analysis so one of the other issuesof course is helping customers come intothe compliant environment so we'velaunched a new move analysis capabilitythat helps you along that journey andthat's been been launched recently aswell we're of course expanding theofferings for the markets that you canhave access to impact level 5 is now GAand we've added new services in the lastmonth so you know this is our North Starreally we want every service to be superduper compliant and all of the offeringsunfortunately it's a long journey to getthere so this will be what we're goingthrough is constantly adding newservices this is a big Focus fororganization and team and a lot of whatwe're focusing on over the the nextreally years to comeI mentioned itar earlier like I said I'mreally excited about itar because itarreally impacts my government supplychain customers a lot of folks don'teven know that they're impacted by itarand this has been an area that wasexceptionally difficult to accomplishand we accomplished it in some reallycool ways in terms of the controls andimplementation we're doing on the backend of the infrastructure and a lot ofteams at Google put on a lot of effortto get this done but really it is kindof the high water mark in a lot of waysit's even harder than fedramp becausefedramp of course is a compliance systemwhich means you can work with thegovernment to understand risk and makesure you're navigating and workingthrough all those those issues with itarthere's no such thing it's you know ourmy lawyer would call it the stop signlaw you're either there you're notyou're stopped or you're not uh so foritar it was kind of a high water markfor us in launching that into productionwas a really big deal and we're reallyproud of that it's also made it a lotsimpler for us to achieve our othercompliance systems as well given thatit's the high water mark once they'reonce we're there a lot of other thingsget a lot easier but we've also expandedServices there over the last year andthere's some new capabilitiesSovereign controls have expandedrecently as well I mentioned a fewregions and I'm about to mention a fewmore that we've been launching Sovereigncontrols into and the service expansionis happening there as well so newservices are coming becoming availableand we have access to new Sovereigncapabilities and then new Sovereignregions we're working on Japan Italy andSpain that adds to our growing list ofcapabilities like I mentioned the UnitedStates Canada Israel Australia and thenof course Germany France EU Italy Spainand Japan so long list and a lot ofcapabilities available for you like Imentioned earlier our North Stars tomake it consistent reduce the total costby making it a lot easier for you tohave access to those environmentswhether those be directly for Googlefrom Google or through our SovereignPartners as wellokay uh and then just to kind ofhighlight a few of these other ones interms of the partner solutions forassured workloads and these are ourregulated Sovereign solution partnerinitiative that we've got going here aswell so we're excited about this uh onthere you've got of course Symantec ourfriends from broadcom involved with thatoneum veeam NetApp mongodb lytics uh nasuniserver General uh Fortinet Citrix andelastic are in the program today sowe're really excited about thesepartners and bringing them into ourregulated and Sovereign big family I'llcall it a family why notum okay another thing that I'm reallyexcited about this has been kind ofsomething that I've been dreaming aboutreally for years is uh reducing the costand complexity of getting yourauthorization to operate or ATO and yeahit's quite the journeyuh and for those that have gone throughthat Journey before of course therelationship is the work that you dowith yourself the work that you do withyour cloud provider the work you do withconsultants and then you work you dowith your three power three pal and whatwe're working with is a combination withkerasoft Coal Fire stack armor andsecond front to really reduce the totalcost here and accelerate the process bywhich you can get your authority tooperate or ATLand again that can be used to acceleratefedramp State ramp or any of the impactlevel accreditations that you'researching for and again I wish when Ihad started this was an offeringavailable to me because this was hard soreally really excited about thisum and again what we're doing here iswe're offering credits to help alongthis journey help with that federal andstate contract vehicle access fromcaresoft that's really exciting againwhen I set out that was another thingthat I really wish I had access to orthose contract vehicle Vehicles soworking with our partners to gain accessto those and then of course access toexpertise from Coal Fire stack armor andsecond front to get those atos so somereally interesting capabilities like Isaid I'm really really excited aboutthis oneum and working with our partners toaccelerate your journey into into Cloudespecially into fedrampum all right so I'm going to call it afew other sessions here because we'regoing to call up my buddies but thenwe'll open it up to questions andhopefully you'll ask all of the cloudgovcloud assured workloads and SovereignCloud questions that you can imagine andmy friends here can help with that sothe other sessions to look out for iswhat's next for those SecurityProfessionals security foundations forevery production workload how tomitigate data exfiltration risks withGoogle Cloud security controls of courseone of my favorites there is theconfidential Computing work work andthen delight's doing some work as wellwhich is the multinational complianceand a single cloud with assuredworkloads again my super cute assuredworkless baby so go check that one outtooum and then build the securityfoundation with trusted Cloud as well sorecommend each of these sessions a lotof my good friends are presenting thankyou so so much for coming today wereally appreciate it thank you[Applause]"
