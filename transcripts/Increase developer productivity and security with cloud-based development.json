    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thanks for joining our improving developproductivity and security withcloud-based development environmentthanks everybody for joining I'm Marcusproduct manager within Google Clouddeveloper experience organizationspecifically focused on cloudworkstations and I'm joined today byChristian hi everyone I am Christianguaca I'm from Commerce Bank fromGermany and I'm heading to cyber Centerfor excellence team in comets Bank I'mproud to join the session for Marcusall right so agenda for today right sowe start by giving folks a high levelreview of what is caloric stations whatproblem it Services then we move on tothe Rainy product Deep dive talk a bitabout the features both existing and newfeatures introduced and finally aquestion we talked a bit more about theCommerce Bank story and journey whenadopting workstations at scale right solet's start okay so Clorox stationsoverview right so the key idea here islet's first talk about recapping all thetools Google cloud has currentlyavailable for uh developers right so youcan see here a list of those toolsessentially the first of them was acloud shell so Cloud shell essentiallyprovides you with a pre-configureddevelopment environment available from aterminal the dahu is a developmentenvironment which is focused onsimplifying onboarding and evaluationlet's say you want to run a gcloudcommand or want to quickly set up pgkcluster did you hear you just go to abrowser either on the cloud console orthe Standalone cloud share and within afew seconds you're up and running andgetting some basic prototypes workingnext we also have Cloud code the ideahere are ID extensions you can installon your preferred ID be it Visual Studiocode be it IntelliJ pycharm the ideahere is helping you while you'redeveloping against Google Cloud let'ssay imagine kubernetes development ongke cloudron development and so on andso forth right so let's uh three yearsago we announced a major update to acloud shell editor essential usingcapabilities such as debugging andtroubleshooting and versioning did youhear was also make it easier for taskswhich are Developer specifics such as Iwant to try an API Google cloud orquickly get a basic web server up andrunning from a configure environmentthis year at Google I O early the zeroannounced the ga of cloud Rec stationswhich will be essentially covering indepth uh today you can see essentiallyworkstations being the dev environmentwhich goes beyond onboarding that's theenvironment which is tailored forday-to-day development imagine you'vebeen able to customize a environmentwith the libraries and the tools youneed for your day-to-day developmentand finally also today you folks sawabout some of the new expansions we hadon the private preview on the duet sitethe key idea of duet is bringingdeveloper assistance directly on your IDthe true Focus here is one enablingproductivity for example as developeryou do more with less less time lesscontext switching less efforts and alsoenablement and empowerment let's say asdeveloper can now do things which shouldbe otherwise a bit Out Of Reach orpotentially beyond your uh eitherbecause you're too time consuming or abit above your technical uh punch weightessentially by helping you with acompanion EI available either via achatbot or via a chat either via chatbotor via contextual code generation rightso with that overview let me then divedeeper into Clorox stations itself rightso you can see here a screenshot of whatit looks like the key idea ofworkstations is essentially providing anon-demand development environmentavailable from any machine you want touse here right so the key idea here isuhit's a fully customizable developmentenvironment the idea is yes you get acode editor like we're seeing here butalso get all the layers of the stack youneed for your day-to-day developmentsuch as you can specify ID extensionsthe libraries the compute the storageGPU accelerators network connectivityessentially everything for you to havethis fully packaged ready to godeveloper experience right so that's onething another key Focus here isconsistency among developer developmentenvironments the idea here is withworkstations you can define a goldenworkstation configuration which isconsistent across your developers let'ssay if you are a team working on Javawith a jdk in Spring you can have allthese tools pre-installed and ready forthem to use from workstations right andthe final one here is all of this isbuilt with security mind the idea hereis uh as you folks you see here I alsodo that while having a series ofcompliance security and dataexfiltration mechanisms but in so thatyou can have an improved developerexperience without sacrificing yoursecurity in the processso just a quick thing here is you sawnow what workstations is let me talkquickly about the three key problems weheard from many customers like CommerceBank and others that we believeworkstations as well suited uh toaddress right so the first one is Devenvironment setup right that's one thingwhich we hear time and time again thatit may take days weeks in some extremecases even months for a developer to beable to get you hey I can read writecode and submit pull requests and a goodcheckup this time it just spent itduring a development environment setupyou're starting to write dependencies soon so forth that's one task whichworkstations was really to address byhaving this consistent environments thesecond one here is a security andexfiltration prevention right so themoment you have your code and dataliving on a local machine you're byDesign increasing your potential attacksurface the idea here is if you movethis code and data to a work throughenvironment which is cloud-based you notonly you minimize your attack servicebut also open up the possibility ofusing some of the security controls thatwe talk later such as vpcsc Beyond CorpEnterprise and so on so forth right andfinally but not least developerproductivity the key idea here issomething you saw for example waschallenges with accessing a resource ona uh on a private Network all of thoseare essentially kind of things whichtypically it's hard kind of hard to finda balance between velocity and securitythat's workstation from The Sweet Spotwhere you can have pre-configuringenvironments while following theorganization and security policies aswell as more flexible compute and thebenefits of networking at higher highervelocity network access for handling uhartifacts rightso with that said that was the highlevel review workstations let me now doa per feature Deep dive for our focus oneach of these three problem spaces Imentioned uh before right sothe first one here is developmentenvironments uh fast onboarding withdeveloping environments ready to go hereright so folks can see here a videoessentially showing the creation of acloud Rec stations the idea here iswithin a few minutesyou can get the development environmentup and running the idea here as you cansee here is as a developer I have achoice of configurations thoseconfigurations can be created by Centralplatform team in updated here is a peakone configuration once I click on startyou see here within a few secondsI get a workstation up and running andwhat happened here behind the scenes iscreated evm we attached an image withthe customization of the developer needsplus we mounted the persistent disk andthis process actually happens fasterbecause you have the keyboard supportfor a pool of form VMS to essentiallyallow this 30 seconds to uh writing codeexperience here inside SMH before youcan see in that case we are showing a vscode in the browser you can see ourextension potentially having a series ofcode samples another case you can see abunch of java code but it could as wellbe for example your privatemicroservices or some internal code youhave here and it also comes withextensions and tools pre-install rightso if you hear open a basic Java fileyou see you've got LinkedIn you get allthe Java extensions capabilitiespre-installed plus it comes with theright version of the jdk pre-start andall the Java libraries needed here rightso the idea here is having this set uppre-baked and defined in a centralmanner by platform teams rightthat's it next one is GPU accelerationright so uh one thing which I decided tomention now is we have GPU accelerationsupport within Cloud Rec stationscovering essentially a100s t4s h100s allthe most popular uh gpus available ongcp and this essentially allows yourdevelopers even either if they'reworking on vs code pycharm Jupiter labor rstudio to be able to benefit fromGPU accelerations for uh machinelearning tests or data science specifictasks right without having to worryabout setting up gpus or in about Cudadriver setup for being productivenext one is region support right sir weare very excited to hear about theglobal interests we'll be getting oncloud workstations our team is workingvery hard at adding extending our regionsupport we're excited to see in our pettraining region supported across fivedifferent four sorry four differentcontinents with uh ItalyIsrael and Australia been in regionswhich you just added over the last uhmonths and many more to come as wellall right now shifting gears toproductivity right so let's talk aboutthe capabilities available for improvinguh developer productivity during thekeynote uh this morning folks heardabout duet in Google cloud and folks canknow that duet comes pre-installed onour Cloud workstations essential you cando here is once you sign up to duet onthat link and have here you canessentially enable duet for developmentteams what you see is essentiallysomething similar to what you're seeinghere on the screen essentially once youenable duet you'll be able to get codecompletions code Generations as well asa contextual chat assistance which isvery helpful for tests such as codeexplainability or test generation or forexample troubleshooting of echo it's avery interesting side-by-side companionthe chatbot as well is aware of all thefiles that have opened within your ID sohere you can say hey explain me my codeor explain me what these three functionsdo you don't have to worry about havingto match exactly the signature of thefunctions you have with between yourcode and you also have this featuresmart actions essentially whenever youselect code within a cloudwork stationswhen you have duet enabled you see theoption of contextual action such asgenerating code in case you're selectingcommon string or a dog stringor explaining code or generating unittests or generating doc strings right soand again if folks want to trade out youcan go to cloud.google.comAI to join our previewfor next slide I'll talk a bit about ourstudio and posit workbench right so youheard from many uh R and pythondevelopers and data scientists that theyreally like using the end-to-endexperience which posit workbenchprovides them as such integrating codeeditor and all the elements of thedevops of the software development lifecycle uh they need so a mixer channelsour partnership with a posit workbenchnow in GA in cleric stations essentiallyproviding managed support for positworkbench with rstudio including supportfor for bringing your own license yeahhere you can now use your own licensesfor using posit in addition to the othertools and IDs available within Cloud Recstations in a managed settingand I then welcome posit to our familyof IDs supported in cloudwork stationsand workstations was built with a coreprinciple in mind which is be meetingdevelopers whatever they are right so weknow developers have a myriad of uhtools that were selected over time tooptimize for the productivity our ideahere is to allow developers toexperience the benefit of remotedevelopment and cloud-based environmentswithout requiring changes to workflowsso you can see here this light isessentially showing many of the ideasupport such as vs code IntelliJ Gallerystudio with many more on the pipeline onour side rightfinally Beyond IDs workstation orsupport some additional interfaces whichcome in handy on the development lifecycle for example as you can see hereyou can use IntelliJ can access aworkstation via our local IntelliJviajet Prince Gatewayyou can for example if you prefer usinglocal vs code you can use your local vscode and use remote SSH being able toaccess your extension via a secure SSHtunnel which is enforced with gcp IEMpolicies so the idea here is you canhave the best of both words essentiallythe local development experience whileyou're being able to benefit from aremote machine and the security andcompute power it could provide you andyou can even set up SSH or even TCPtunnels from the workstation to localmachine and you can see how this couldbe handy for more complextroubleshooting in a web server kind ofeither troubleshooting or developmentweb server kind of setups rightnow shifting gears I want to talk a bitabout security and direct filtrationmechanisms delicitation preventionmechanisms right so first I want to talka bit about our integration with BeyondCorp Enterprise right that's somethingwhich we announced at Google I O earlythis year and you continue to work onextended this further the idea here isbringing zero trust security mechanismsdirectly to your developmentenvironments right so there are twospecific features I want to highlighthere the first one is data lossprotection you can actually see that onthe recording here that yeah here is youcan essentially enforce policies toprevent uh to mitigate data lossdirectly on your clients such aslimiting copy and paste of text ordownload of files either blanketpolicies or policies matching specificstring patterns so you can say Hey youcan block access to only to sensitivepieces of code but allow access to otherpiece of code that's one and two iscontext our axisright so cloudy stations also supportsthe ability for you to set up accesspolicies which are take into account uhcontext aware factors such as your IEPlocation whether device is secured orhas specific software installed ordepending on your geolocation of devicesthat yeah here is providing additionallayers of security you can pick andchoose to add to meet your securitypostures rightnext thing shared VPC support right soone thing I want to highlight here whichis a very important point ofworkstations is a workstation isessentially a managed service whichprovides environments essentially VMSrunning containers inside of VPCworkstations using VM is the importantpoint we don't usecontainers or pods as a securityboundary because they're known to havepotential excitation virtuality here ishaving each developer having a separateenvironment mitigates potential risk oflateral contamination of thoseenvironments the case of a nextsituation plus our workstations runinside of your you can choose to runthose Insider for VPC which allows youto then bring the typical securitymechanisms used for your workloads foryour production workloads such as VPCservice controls or we can potentiallyeven say create a disk backup policieslet's say you want to have a weeklypipeline to back up the date on yourdisks for sale potentially auditingpurposesand uh that's it for this oneand finally one here is for platformadmins we've been expanding the amountof services workstations uh can be youthe amount of services you can use formanaging your Cloud workstations rightso the key idea here is yes we have thetypical Cloud console NG cloud servicesbut increasingly hearing about customerswanting to use let's say terraform orKCC other services for orchestriandirect stations that yeah here is youcan now use terraform as folks can seehere or apis Focus trainer extensionsessentially using the same recipes andplumbing you have for your orderproduction resources and you can createyour Dev environments the same with your380r production environments rightfolks that's it at a high level now handover for to Christian to talk a bit moreabout their Journey on cloudworkstations yeahgreat thank you very much Marcos I guessthis was very interesting until here andum I will hope I hopefully can cancontinue and I will talk a little bitabout Commerce Bank and how we are goingto leverage uh cloudworks and what weare also doing as of today with Cloudworkstations so first of allum I want to introduce you a little bitto comments bank because you maybe don'tdon't know what we are doing so commentsBankum has around 26 000 corporate clientcustomers and just under 11 millionprivate and small business customers inGermany and uh comments bank is theleading bank for the John middlestone sothis means we have a portfolio ofcustomers for corporate corporateclients and for the private and smallmedium businessesfurthermore we have a focus on fivebusiness models so our business model isstructured into five elements one is thepersonal advisory offering so meaningfor us the customer is always in thefocus and so we want to be the bestpartner for our customer next is aconsistent customer focus so the changesthe demand of the customer and the thewishes of the customer changes so weneed to adapt Nexus of coursecomprehensive digitalization so this isone part of why we why I'm here today isbecause we are offering more and moreservices on a digital level andumsame goes for portfolio which we bringto to a digital world the next uhprofitable profitability before growthso this means that we need to focus onthe on the customer and for us again thefocus is customer and customer only andlast but not least sustainability whichis an important topic for us not onlyfor providing Sustainable Solutions butalso helping our customers to transitionin sustainable strategiesso the next we have comments back andwithin comets Bank there are manydifferent divisions one of this divisionis Big Data and advanced Analyticsum this is the division I'm I'm workingin and I just want to give you a briefglance at what what we're doing how wecould characterize us so we are roughly500 people uh spread across fourcountries and we love being Pioneers Sowithin comets Bank we have been thefirst area in in public cloud andum we value Partnerships so meaningwithin the cloud we have got very goodfeedback from other key areas from otherdivisions telling us hey what you'redoing is good and actually we we like topartner with youand what's actually quite interestingand what I want to highlight today isthis one point is we also DriveInnovation and what we are doing sincewe started working on public cloud andwhat we're doing until today is umactually we're working closely togetherwith Google and we are also influencingthe Google Cloud source code so we havecontributed some lines to the to thesource code of Google Cloud so whenyou're using something with security orwith containers there's a likelihoodthat you're using actually some codewhich came originally originally fromfrom commence Bankso and of course we have a priority of adiversea membership of employees and we we alsodrive with developing new new talentsand last but not least we aim for adynamic mindset to grow furthermoreand to give you some examples from abusiness point of view what we are doingso baa creates value from data thismeans we are gathering data from fromall of comets Bank we may be making itaccessible to other teams in combatsbank and possibly also outside ofcomments bank and we offer severalservices to it so meaning how to consumedata and how to get insights out of thedata and how to work with the data so weare also providing tools for ourcustomers in the bank and outside of thebank to process the dataand last but not least what's maybe thethe most difficult part here what willalso then connect to Cloud workstationis the Innovation part together with aregulatory partbecause why we can do all this greatstuff we also need to to make sure thatwe adhere to the regulations which applyto usand so to give you two examples of theuse case business use case we are doingin in BDA is first electronicalself-disclosure so this is like applyingAi and machine learning toum to transaction data to classify themand the second example is something wecall press for today so we are scanningthe news everyone can see and and andapply the knowledge we gained from thisnews to reach out to our customers andconnect these customers with arelationship of the bankand now we're coming slowly back to toCloud workstationsum finally this is my team cyber Centerof Excellence so we are doing threethings first is data protection somaking sure that we have the LegalFoundation to process datasecond is information security so all ofconfidentiality Integrity availabilityof data and processes and third last butnot least Cloud mainly public cloud andwithin Cloud again there are threethings we are doing first is we aretaking care of use cases bringing usecase to the cloud so the two examples Ijust mentioned like press for today orelectronical theft disclosure we helpthis use case migrate to the cloudand during this journey on the cloud wealso develop something something what wecall the cloud Enterprise Suite becausethe cloud we don't only want to havesecure we also want to have ittrustworthy and this means whenever webring a use case to the cloud we makesure that problems resolved once we onlysolve really once and then have productsready for next use case to come and thisis just the suit suit that we that webuilt and on this journey of course wealso have to make sure we we take theculture with us the people with us so wealso have something which we call the Eequals MC squared program which means wewe want to get the excitement into ourcolleagues making sure that we multiplyour knowledge with spark curiosity andof course Drive the the culture forwardand now the next question is okay now wehave learned a little bit about cometsBank about big data and advancedanalytics about the Cyber Center ofExcellence but why should we chooseCloud workstations well we had onesimple situation we found ourselves inThis was um our developers and analystsum came to us and said hey we need aneasy solution to create Solutions on thecloudnext we have local IDs yes but they arenot made for You Know Rich targets andendpoints in the cloud and the lastsituation that we faced was umdevelopers did actually take care oftheir local machines in stores aftertheir installed packages and from thesesituations we derived three challengesthe first key challenge is how can weprovide an IDE that is that has accessto Cloudand on-prem CSD at the same timenext how can we make sure that weprovide all the software that isrequired for developers to actuallydevelop new software or to do dataanalytics and how can we avoid the issueit works on my machine but not onanother else computerand last but not least but also Marcostouched was how can we decrease thesetup time from maybe weeks or monthsdown to maybe below a minuteand the resolution was actually Cloudworkstationsand Cloud workstations allows up to setup as we have seen in the in the videofor Marcos set up an environment for adeveloper who joins us today at the sameday at the same hour in the same minuteand thanks to thatum goes to it goes a little bitum yeah prepared work that we did whatwas that we connected cloudworksstations to our on-prem CSD environmentmaking sure that we install everythingthat is required from our point of viewthat is legally allowedand on the end which works perfectly inthe cloudumand next we do not only look at thedevelopers and elders but we also haveto look at the administrators who makesure that what the developers are usingis actually a compliant a b can bemanaged in a central place and this isalso something which was enabled byCloud workstationsand something which is often overlookedbut what I want to highlight here isalso um the cost model the cost is verytransparent and this pay as you go themoment the developer shuts down its owncomputer his own computer her owncomputer in front of him or her theclouds workstation will also be shutdown some minutes after and you can seethis in the costs you can see this in inthe management and this is just a niceand handy feature to make sure we knowwhat we have to pay forand um as Marcus also highlighted thereare three things I also want to Deepdive into one is security how can wemake Cloud workstation secure second iscustomization we have talked aboutsecurity but how can we marry this withcustomization and last but not leastintegration how can we integrate Cloudworkstations into Commerce bank's cicdworldso let me first start with security soespecially within Financial institutesyou have a lot of regulations to followyou have in-house regulations you haveregulations in Germany which are quiterestricted you have regulations inEurope like the gdpr I guess there'ssomething similar here in Californiawith a ccsa and of course you haveGlobal regulations and comets Bankacting as a global Institute financialinstitute we have to adhere to all ofthese regulations at the same timeso this means we need to make sure a wehave control over our Network this iswhere the VPC service where the VPCfeature of cloud workstations come inhandy we need to make sure that the dataonly flows where we want to control itaway we want to flow itnext which is very important for us iscustomer encryption keys so whatever weput on these Cloud workstations we needto make sure it is encrypted our underour key it is great that Marcos isencrypting everything by by default butwe want to keep it secure under commentsbank's keynext we want to apply VPC servicecontrol so when we use cloudworkstations with other servers onGoogle cloud like let's say cloud buildwe want to make sure that the data onlyflows to that certain specific Cloudbuild and not to any Cloud builds maybein a private projectaccess sheer record analyzation so whenwe develop code when we develop newenvironments we need to make sure thatthis stays there where the regulatorwants to stay it that's mostly Europethat's maybe Germany that's maybe theNetherlandsnext we want to make sure that everyapplication we use in the bank has somecertain industry security certificationsso like ISO 27001 or psic5 you name itand this is also fulfilled by Cloudworkstations and the list goes on wehave service level agreements where wehave a certain amount of uptime we haveasset inventory where we can see howmany Cloud workstations we have who isusing which Cloud workstation how longwe have logging of course we havemonitoring of the cloud workstationswith identity controlwe have to manage the IDE where you haveseen the plethora of different Ides thatyou can have like rstudio or VisualStudio code and all of this together isactually what what makes Cloudworkstations a good security fit for usbecause actually if you look at thisthis list it looks like really a reallyreally long list but I can assure youthat we need to check area of theseboxes before we can run Cloudworkstations or any other servers and wework together closely with Marcus tomake sure before we run the firstproductive workload on on the cloudworkstations that the checkbox has madebut now we have talked about securityand access okay now we are we have aquite secure boundary but how can wecustomize it such that we can actuallyserve our developers and the first thingthat we that we did is we looked herehow what what is actually needed weasked our developers what do you wantand this was the first experience to ourdevelopers usually they get served whatthey wantum because this is just how things havebeen and now we start we thought okay ifwe start new then maybe here's this newtool Cloud workstation how can we makesure the developers feel home and getthe tools that they need and so we wewant to make sure that we have packageready for them we want to have the IDEthey want to work in with we want tomake sure it's a programming languagethey need to work to work with same goesfor packages containersand then we also have certain uh let'ssay groups of people working with itsome need gpus like those are which arecloser to to processing data then otherswhich need a lot of CPU and and RAMwhich which need to to store a lot ofdata and so we came up with personas andactually we have we have templated thisinto four different categories and yousee it on the on the right hand side ofthe screen so we take Cloud workstationswe have a set of Administrators makingsure that we only have a certain set oftemplates and then people can select outof a certain set of templates whichconfiguration they need so we haveactually two groups we have developersand data scientists with two completelydifferent usage profiles the developerwants to to to to write code maybe wantsto use test data and this is somethingwhich what we call the test box part ofof our Enterprise Suite I mentionedearlier and there's just one button theyclick they say hey I want to have a testbox they click on it and guess what twominutes later or maybe even one minutelater they have everything ready theyhave their own project they have theirown cloud workstation they have theirown bigquery and all of their theirtheir home filled environment in orderto start withsame with the data scientists datascientist doesn't want to work with withtest data because they want to buildmachine learning models which worksusually compared with with synthesizeddata or at least with test data so theyneed access to productive data so thisis a different workflow and a differenttooling they need but there's no problemto it because we can customize Cloudworkstations in the security frameworkto serve both types of Developersand the third point and last Point as adeep Drive is the integration how can wemake sure that the cloud workstation isintegrated in an existing environment inat combat springso um we then built a cloud native CSDPipeline with mbdaa and we made surethat we have the connectivity first toour git to our on-prem git environmentbecause this is where the code lies nextwe are connected to our on-premum repositories for the containers atlibraries and last but not least we alsohave connected it to to Cloud build thento further stage in the in the CSDPipeline and now the interesting parthere is that it is not only connected toon-prem but it is also connected to newsecurity tools such as Azure open sourcesoftware where we can use libraries thathave been checked by by Googleum and then which feeds into our intoour library management system same goesfor container scanning which would useartifact container for and make surethat that everything flows together inCloud workstations and that thedevelopers and analysts only have onepoint of contact which is the analyticswhich is the customerendpoint in the in the cloud workstationand of course what was announced whatyou might have seen this morning isDruid AI for cloud workstations and thisis also something we are testing rightnow and uh we're looking very muchforward to the to the features comingand um it's a lot of fun working withthese new tools and and a huge gain ofum of productivityand I also want to show you an examplehow we used Cloud workstations in aday-to-day use case so one example isESG or short for environmentenvironmental social and governmentaldataso we have a bdaa use case which is justcalled ESG and there was one goal thegoal was to process ESG data for riskevaluation within one monthand the tasks brought to us to ccoe wasaprovide use case lifecycle for the usecase on gcpsecond enable the developers as fast aspossible and third ensure that thearchitecture everything is working withCloud nativeand so we started working and after somesome uh some days we actually had thesolution in our pockets first weprovided a use case specific Cloudworkstation setupwithin a daythen on the second day we talked to thedevelopers and said hey lookeverything's online you just need toclick this button and you can startactually working and so already on daytwo when the project started thedevelopers were available and ready touse the cloud workstation connected toon-prem to all the usual CSD flaws thatwe haveand and started working and due to thisquick setup phase and due to the otherum Cloud native architecture with Cloudfunctions with cloud storage with Pubsub and all of that we made sure thatactually the goal of the use case toprovide this risk evaluation within onemonth was achieved way earlier and um sothis is a good example I guess where youcan see that if you use the right toolsfor the right problems you can make surethat you actually achieve your goals andat the end have a lot of time also leftfor you know partying or doing the nextprojectand I want to also I have I havegathered some quotes here I just want toshare with you because remarkably forthis project was that within baa when webrought and introduced Cloudworkstations to to our developers we gota lot of very good feedback so nine ofout of 10 developers actuallyrecommended Cloud workstations to theirnext developers who then approached usand so we had this Avalanche effect ofdevelopers actually knocking on our doorand saying hey I also want to test Cloudworkstations can I get to the betaprogram and um in the end this led to todevelopers analysts and admins beenactually very happy so um we have theadminants who say that hey we have aminimized infrastructure to managethat's great the analyst said it's agreat responsiveness I can use Jupiternotebook directly on on my browserthat's great and the developer said heyit's a nice integration directly intoGoogle Cloud so if I want to runsomething on Google Cloud I just hit thebutton and it's already there the extraCloud workstationsand I'll um to to wrap this up there'sonly like one question left and thequestion is okay well okay now thatthere's this use case in in commentsplaying in pdaa and it worked for thisuse case you have the csud pipelineum but how can I set up something likethis for myself and how can I get Cloudworkstations for you and as you see onthe right hand picture of course you canget a side percent of Excellence yeahbut this is quiteum quite a let's say reserved forcomments bank but the question youshould ask in order to achieve the samethat we did is first what is the reasonwhat what are you trying to achieve andour goal was to a enable the developersand B enable the data scientistsand then the next question is how canyou achieve this so you know no no youyou wish but what do you need for thisdo you need your executive sponsorshipdo you need your on-prem CSD people doyou need to talk to ml Ops people forexample or who can build a solution whocan write the terraform for thisafter you have answered these questionsthe next is about process and technologyso um how can you embedthe cloud workstation in your existingCSD environment you might have a lot ofother stuff running on other platformslike on-prem or maybe uh even othercompletely new environmentsand then the question is also are youallowed to use this new technology youimagine you need to make sure to talk tostandard Setters you need to make surethat this regulatory compliant and tomake sure that your also these get somebenefit out of cloud workstations so wegot this mostly because it's Cloudnative it's a managed VM we don't wantto update operating systems Marcus cando this much better than we can do thisand if you have this this benefit thenthen it's much easier to explain why youyou need to use Scout workstations andlast but not leastum he also of course needs to make surethat you that you talk to the peoplebecause these are the ones thedevelopers and and data scientists theseare the ones who will use the cloudworkstations in the end so um you needto make sure that for them it's easy toget in touch it's easy understandablewhy you are having this tool and um inin the best case you don't need to toyou know convince them but you maybe youjust tell them hey here here's a tooland then by word of mouth as it happenedin our case in bdaa um the developersactually approached us to get in touchwith this new technologyso it's uh the same message heremultiple times it's uh of courseprocesses people and Technology but umthe people is like here the core partin order to drive the cloud workstationto to success in your companyso with this being said um this is astory of Commerce Bank and PDA and Cloudworkstations now handing over back tomacros right thank you so much createsan exciting story from Commerce Bank andexciting to have been part having playeda role on that uh story so yeah as youfolks sawcorrect stations essentially focuses onachieving two goals the first one isincreasing develop productivity both ondev environment setup data developmentand it does so by providing optionalityessentially media where they are withyour tools that's one and she was doingso while you're preserving if notenhancing your security posture byessentially bringing all those securitymechanisms you're familiar to with usingon production and moving those yourdevelopment environments such as VPCvpcsc private Ingres and Ingress orlogin errors keeper videos availablethat was just a is liberal for the haveworkstations there's much more but I nowwant to also first of all thank youfolks for coming herethank you"
