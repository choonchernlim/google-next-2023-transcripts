    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good afternoon everybody and thank youfor coming to our panel this afternoon Ireally appreciate you showing upespecially on the after lunch spotum my name is Yolanda Piazza and I leadthe financial services practice here atGoogle cloud and I thought before wejump into talking about what we're goingto discuss with my esteemed panelistshere Sunil and Rich I thought it onlyseemed fitting seeing as we arefollowing on the theme of AI to show youa video about how we think AI canactually really start to influence andcreate the power of how to changecustomer experiences so with that can weroll the video please[Music][Music][Music]thank youforeign[Music][Music][Music][Music][Music]thank you[Music]thank you foreign[Music][Music][Music]thank you[Music]foreign[Music]thank you[Music]so pretty powerful stuff right I thinkI'm always constantly amazed when I talkto customers sorry to financial servicescustomers the never-ending suggestionsand creativity about the potential andthe power of these use cases continue toto blow my mindbut um as we start to look at what theseopportunities unlock I think we're alljust super excited about the potentialopportunities whether it's from theopportunity to drive out costs in theorganization to accelerate growth withinthe business lines and increase you knowthe relationship with your customer tomanaging fraud or developer productivityand hopefully as you're going throughyour sessions you'll see a little bit ofthat everywhere throughout yourexperience at next todaybut with that let us um like switch overa little bit and uh and talk a littlebit more about grounding on AI as apractice overall so with me I have Suniland Rich and I'm going to let themintroduce themselves for the objectiveof the panel is really to understand alittle bit more about what is yourvision how are you thinking about thepractice what are some of the challengesthat you've encountered because you areFurther Along on your journey that thansome and unpack that a little bit andthen we'll get to watch your predictionfor the future if that makes sense soSunil Rich if I can ask you just tointroduce yourself and then we'll jumpinto the questions thank you young soI'm Sunil coutino I'm the CIO of CMEGroup for those of you who don't knowCME operates one of the world's largestfinancialmarkets in both Spartan derivatives soin addition to markets we also managerisk we have one of the world's mostdiverse and largest clearinghousesand my name is Rich May I'm the umexcuse me group head of financial crimefor Commercial Banking and globalbanking and markets at HSBC and for thelast four yearsum been working on in partnership withGoogle Cloud AML AI product that we'vedeployed within our bank awesome thankyou both so let's dive in so Sunilstarting with you I think we all know AIis a game changer and his creativeconversations none of us thoughtprobably were even possible a couple ofyears ago but I'm really curious as toyour perspective on the state of theadoption of AI in your organizationthank you youum as far as our organization isconcerned I'm actually going to break itup into two parts one talk about ourindustry as a whole how do Capitalmarkets and our clients specially usedata and machine learning and then I'llFocus I'll pivot a little bit and go into CMEso when you think of our clients andespecially our Market participants theyare seeking a signal and they areconfronted with two billion events a dayum and it's very hard to actuallyseparate out the signals you're lookingfor so when I say signals we're talkingabout correlations and correlations infinancial markets are not stable they'realways evolvingum the other things you're looking foris mispricing opportunities andsometimes evenum you know mispricing within a smallmicrosecond boundary so as you canimagine the challenges are immense andour clients use a lot of our data so ifyou see today they spend a lot of theirtime accessing data curating data andthen there's a little bit of time spentin training a modelso this has been going on for quite awhile so financial markets are quiteahead in terms of using AI as a as adisciplineum but you know maybe they are justexploring unsupervised models but mostof the models that Financialmarketplaces work on is mostly aroundsupervised models because you needgreater controlthe second aspect when it comes to CMEwe are focused on actually giving ourclientsum visibility into liquidity the qualityof liquidity when we say liquid qualityof liquidity we mean how tight themarket is and how deep the market is andit is evolving it there's not a singlenumber for the entire day so it itchanges the beginning of the day and theend of the day can be more liquid thanuh at the middle of the day and there isa liquidity walls around announcementslarge announcementsso our goal is to help our clientsactually get those insights very fastwithout having to actually curate thedataother aspects are around quality ofexecution so if you think of a client ora market participant in our industrythe idea is you know you can trade as agiven risk unit in many differentmarkets but how do you choose whichMarket is the most valuable and givesyou the greatest efficiency and in orderto do that you need to take into accountthe capital that is involved the amountof capital you have to put as an outlayto cover your risk plus your commissionsand then look at the quality ofexecution so this is complex so you knowworking with Google and you knowbuilding these tools with vertex Ai andbigquery we were able to do thatum so but that's the state of the marketright now I will Reserve comments on thecompliance and the regulatory side I'llpass on to Rich to address that so atHSBC so the place that I'm most familiarwith what we've done with AIS in thecompliance spacewe've really accelerated our adoption ofAI for compliance use cases over thelast four years we first started withthe idea and the theory that AI wouldbring out more profit precision andgreater benefits and now that we'veactually deployed the product into HSBCwe're seeing that and what that's causedis now that there's a tangible benefituse case that is showing demonstrableimpact for our organization we're seeingmore use cases being generated not justby people that are working with theGoogle team or anyone else but areraising ideas organically throughout theorganization and it's causing us to askbigger questions about what do we needto do to actually enable that youmentioned datafor everyone here I'm sure data isalways going to be a core part of thisbecause for us the first thing we had todo is get our data in order and we haveto do that more broadly to support someof the other use cases so going back tothe question I see accelerating interestand use of AI as it transitions fromtheoretical benefit to actual tangiblebenefit that the organization canrealize I appreciate that and I thinkwhat's really important in that is it'snot about generative AI you guys havebeen doubling down on AI for some timeand I think that gets lost in some ofthe conversation while generative AI hasmade it cool to talk about AI again youreally focused that first which has beenreally important so now Switching gearsa little bit so what is the Vision looklike at CME and what are some of thebiggest challenges for realizing thatVision that do you thinkum I'll start by painting the vision andthen go into challenges a little bit sowhat we envision is a world where we canreduce the time and the toil to actuallybuild a model and train a model uh todayI I believe uh most of us believe thatit takes about 80 percent of the effortis curating data collecting curatingdata and then there is 20 of the effortis on the model so we'd like to flipthatum and you know so we've built a singleUniversal data platform on bigqueryit has over 26 petabytes of data soimagine instance stay an instantaneoussnapshot market snapshot for over 10years so during different periods sovolatile periods quiet periodsso the way we think of it we think uh uhof a financial analyst or a Quant at adesk should be able to actually open aworkbench and then integrate differentconnect very easily to this dataplatform and build and train their modeland then when they derive those insightsshould be able to go from insights toaction very quickly with a click of abutton so that's what we're seeking tobuildum so from the ground up the biggestchallenge is getting all data in oneplace I think without that you knoweverything is just a conversation rightso it's uh you're not you're not makingHeadway so we've achieved we've overcomethat struggle the second isconfidentiality and privacy uh andsecurity of data so it's important tobuild that and we've done that we'vedone uh amazing amount of work includingyou know building customized packagesproduct packages based on a subscriptionso a client would say I want my dataalong with the market snapshot for thistime windowso the ability to build a single timesequence stream event stream for thatclient to train a model uh you know bythe end of this year we'll have thatcapability so available to any modelingenthusiasts we wants to actually link tothat data if they have rights to do soand train their modelthe part that will be challenging is togo from that to executionso several challenges have to beovercome I feelin order to go from model design toexecution but we are getting there Ithink with with our partnership withGoogle and the way we'll connect ourmarkets to an analytic engine will allowus to actually integrate from insightsto action and that's that's thechallenge that we see big lift yeahthat's a big lift just on that bridgehow did you get the organization broughtin because this is much about culturalchange as it is about you know the EQ asmuch as it is the IQno it's you're absolutely right and youcan't talk about it PowerPoints don't dojustice the best thing to do is uhprototypingso we worked on a prototype last yearand it took us 16 weeks to actuallybuild a benchmarking tool this isanother product that we are keen onbuilding with our clients so the theobjective of this tool is to give everyclient the ability to compare theirperformance with the market and alsocompare their performance with otherpeer groups around those peer groups arecalibrated or built around certaincommon characteristics so we came upwith 50 features 50 executioncharacteristics and we had to break thatDimension down and build about six peergroups and it's important to keep thatpeer group stable because people changetheir execution Behavior rightand to be able to compare yourperformance against that that'sabsolutely fantastic and we were able todo that in 16 weeks so once we showedthat I mean the entire organization isnow bought into the value of that ourgoal right now is to actually buildconfidence amongst our clients so theycan take advantage of that room it makessense so rich I I'd love to get yourreaction to some of those challenges andgo start one step further and share alittle bit about hsbc'show they're planning on taking the AIVision into practice so when it comes tochallenges we were not surewhatsoever and some of the points thatyou made definitely resonate with meabout data if I never have to see dataagain I'm quite happy because I've nowhad to up in so many HSBC systems to tryand migrate into the cloud and uh ohwe're missing something and all of thatthat challenge is real I would say oneof the areas that I wasn't expecting achallenge but really became one was onsome of our model risk governance ofbeing able to articulate how an AI modelWorks in a way that's going to actuallygo through a model risk governanceprocess and be reviewable by Regulatorsin a way that is actuallycommon sensical enough for thoseRegulators to understand taking thosevery complex approaches and Distillingthem into something that humans canunderstand is is not always very easyand when I say humans I mean regulatorsand people that aren't familiar withthis on a day in day out I'd just goback to the follow-up question that youhad my number one challenge were thepeople and not that they werechallenging but everyone in thefinancial services industry is builttheir entire career in a place wherestrict rules were thego-to way that you would manage yourrisk automatically or on in an automatedwayteaching them how to do somethingslightly different really challenge themon their thinking and it's not just apiece of kit that can just drop in andreplace your pre-existing system youhave to change the end-to-end frameworkhow you think about it people got verycomfortable over the last 20 30 years ofI know that this system is looking for Xbecause I told it to look for x andthat's what I wanted to do to changethat approach to using an AI based modeland looking at the outputs to see ifthat model is detecting what you arehoping it to detect instead of justtelling it what to detect is a verydifferent approach and that means thatyou have to change your entire frameworkso there's the framework in the processpiece but then also making itexplainable to the people that are goingto receive the outputs of the model is awhole separate challenge that tookas much work as some of the engineeringwork did the last point I'll just makeis some of the skepticism that's outthere about ai ai has been talked aboutquite a bit and when you come in and yousay we're going to find more financialcrime or do Acts or do why there's acertain element of skepticism that youhave to overcome and you're exactlyright prototype experiment and then putevidence in front of people but for eachmarket that we would deploy this newproduct into it was always the samestory I don't believe what you'retelling meand there was this initial resistancefor a few months until we could gettheir data experiment with it and thenproduce that initial set of results andonce they saw that initial set ofresults then they would buy in becauseyou're now confronting them withevidence about how it is working butthere is a healthy amount of skepticismon whether it's too good to be true andso overcoming that by showing them thatit is actually better is a huge part ofhow we want some of the hearts and Mindsto get people invested in it and I thinkboth of you it wasn't just your internalcustomer but you have to convince yourexternal customer for you you've got tothink about regulators and gettingbuy-in on this new process and youmentioned how you're trying to convincethe customers to come along yourcustomers to come along on this journeywith you so it's not just the that EQ ofinternal aid but it's how do you take itthat one step further which you exactlyit's a great point because we've had tointeract with about 30 Regulatorsglobally around the world and we almosthave to do it in three stages of justtalking about what we intend to do thenwe start to show them some of theresults interim and then we can showthem hey we now know it's going to workin the way that we expected and we'regoing to turn this on but it takes thatdevelopmental staging with TheRegulators just as much with theinternal stakeholdersand you do still get that sameskepticism of I don't believe it show meyeah and so you have to be prepared toshowyep absolutely soum hopefully most people know that welaunched um Google Cloud launched theirAML AI productum just a couple of months ago which hasbeen a huge success and thank you somuch because this was all done inpartnership with HSBC and you've hadphenomenal results as a result of thatso two to four acts more identificationof suspicious activity and 60 reductionin volume which is huge when you startto think about going from thatrule-based model and switching over andallowing AI to lead and drive andpredict those outcomes socongratulations it actually LED you towin the model risk manager of the Yearaward which was phenomenal so a hugecongratulations on thatbut uhto hear more from you about your teamshow are they collaborating with Googlehow did you what were the concerns alongthe way I mean doing this something thisbig with a third party isn't atraditional Norm so I'd love to hear alittle bit about that you know it'sactually really interesting we had highlevel buy-in from the top downum and there was some initial feelingout between the two teams I think ofwhat do you know that I don't know andwhy don't you just give us yourgive us access to your tools and we cando it on our side we're a bank we havesome brilliant data scientists butnothing is going to be done all internalso we had to partner and we had to setthat out from the outset that we'recoming in with financial crime knowledgeand a healthy sense of adventure to trythis Google we need you to bring yourtechnical prowess your engineeringskills and your cloud computing spaceand let's come together and work throughthis the biggest learning I have fromthis for me personally was we approachedGoogle with what we thought we wanted todo we thought we know we want a b and cwe had to strip that way back actuallyto get down to what are we trying toachieve what are our objectives we wantto find more financial crime we want tohave less false positivesonce we stripped it back to those coreobjectives we're able to actually workthrough how we got there much morecollaboratively than before becausethere are things that we didn't knowwere within the art of the possible inpartnering with Google and that's thepoint of a partnership is to figure outthings that you don't know so we came inwith some preconceived notions of wellwe don't know how that can be done soobviously it can't be done so weactually just want to do option Cand when we started speaking with theengineering team they're like why areyou doing that you want to get here youwant to find more financial crime theeasiest way to do that is thisand we didn't even think that that wasan option so we had to strip away ourown preconceived notions our ownlimitations our own kind of thinkingabout this through the HSBC lens andleave that to the side and really cometogether and say what are we trying toachieve can we achieve it togetherwhat's the best way to do that and thatwas when the partnership really came tolife where we were able to workcollaboratively together leveraging eachother's skills with a healthy amount ofrespect between the two teams and that'sultimately how it got to be successfulyeah so you know you're going on thesame and similar thank you but you'regoing on the same and similar Journeythis is a partnership of that thatrequires Innovation and big thinkinganything you can chat in in that areawell we're trying a few thingsum you know on the AI and machinelearning side our goal is to try andbuild a client sandbox so to build thisconfidence the level of confidence wetalked aboutso with this client sandboxum you know a Quant doesn't have toactually you know go through the pain ofacquiring the data within their tenantspacecurating it and then making it availablefor a model so with the with byco-locating data they can bring theirown data and use our data Lake they canbuild a model that combines the two sothe Innovation there is to actuallybuild tools that will merge the two datasets while they are not co-located withthey're not actually sitting physicallyright next to each other but they'rejust co-located so that's something thatwe're working on access to as I pointedout before access to thisdata set dynamicallybased on the client's interest ratherthan creating packages of products andthen listing them out that's anotherthing that we've developedfurther going further with Google on theAI side we saw a video on customerservice we are focused on that usinggenerative AI actuallybut it is more around knowledge searchso we're just tipping our toesso there we see two two areas of focusone to give our clients the ability toget informationuh we have clients in 150 countries sothey all have different ways of actuallyquerying data so our goal is to giveeach one of those clients aninstantaneous experience aconversational experience so that'ssomething that we plan to release asquickly as we can the second part ismore internally focused is aroundduvet and a code a coding partner orcollaborator and hereum what what what is really powerful isthe ability of a collaborator to help usmigrate from Legacyplatformsto newer platforms especially Oracle toalloythat's not very easy or if you look atyou know thankfully we don't havemainframes but we've asked this questionCOBOL to Java or something like that theentire Financial Services industry isstuck with a lot of Legacyum you know platforms so that capabilityis really powerful for us so those aresome of the areas in which we'recollaborating with Google awesomeso Switching gears a little bit andstarting to look to the future you knowthere's so much opportunity we talkabout use cases in most scenarios when Igo in and start talking to our customersthey're like here's a list at least of100 plus differentum you know use cases out there but I'dlove to learn a little bit from you guyson what do you think the future of AIreally looks like and how do you thinkit really has an opportunity to disruptthe financial services market so nowmaybe we can start with youum you know I'll speak a little bitabout our Market participants and thenI'll switch over to how CME looks at itso from our clients perspective I I feelthat um we you know data and data drivenstrategy is only going to accelerate sowe have to make it very simple and easyfor the quants to actually train theirmodels and build it so what I seehappening there with the modelinnovations that we see is a greater useof unsupervised models not to maketrading decisions but to identifysignals as I as I talked about it whichis you know done today in a verycontrolled waythey will still be this humanintervention and controls before beforethat is injected into markets but we seegreater use of that risk so we've wehaven't spoken a lot about risk but riskis the ability to foreseelosses in the futureunder different Market States today it'sa data intensive exercise and it takes along time so we see that changingdramaticallyum but we don't we don't see this asremoving the human humanyou know involvement but more of aidingour quants in identifying scenarios thatcan exhaust a set of resources that areset aside so reverse stress testing isone area that we think will evolve so Ican't speak a lot about generative AIbut at least in those two areas we cansee us taking advantage of all theadvancements and Transformers awesomethank you Rich what about you so I thinkit all boils down to just more broadermore broad adoption of AI is what Iforesee the use cases are coming Fastand Furious at us from all over theplace but I think most when I talk aboutthe regulator aspectum I have a friend who's just retiredwhat I'm about to say will give you ahint to his age but when he first wasstarting in compliance it was backbefore we even had any sort of automatedmonitoring of customer accounts it wasall done by humans or thick cellsa hard timewhen they first started buildingautomated monitoring softwarehe went into the regulators and theysaid how can you get comfortable thatthe software is doing what the human wasdoing as well and then it becameindustry standard within five yearsI think we're fairly close to that sametime period now where we've had to go inand convince Regulators that this worksand it's better and now that we'reseeing that it is better and TheRegulators are seeing that it's betterwithin the next five years I do expectthose Regulators to say you have thiscapability why aren't you using AI to dothis better faster more efficiently withbetter outcomes and so when I thinkabout what's coming in the next fiveyears I think now that theory of thebenefit of AI is translating into actualdemonstrable evidence of that benefitand the question is going to switch fromhow did you get comfortable to use forusing it to why aren't you using it andthat's what I think is coming in thenext few years yeah thank you thank youum so rich Sunil thank you so much forjoining me on stage more importantlythank you for being such phenomenalpartners with all of us and we reallyreally appreciate the journey that we'reon together so thank you[Applause][Music]"
