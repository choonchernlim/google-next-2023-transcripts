through the sessions we alsohave some demos down below so hopefullyyou get a chance to see thatum so I'm Celine van Gran I'm a productmanager on the Google Maps platform inthe Geo sustainability team I'm joinedby a few of my colleagues here I've beenwith Google for nine years I've beenbuilding impact focused action-orientedsustainability products for those yearsand this is the culmination of some ofour products that we're gonna going toshow you today so I'll tell you a littlebit about the environmental categorythen we will spend a little bit of timeon the apis themselves and we'll have alittle bit of time for questionsso let me start with Googlesustainability Google's been focused onsustainability for a long timeespecially in our operations being thefirst company in 2007 to become fullycarbon neutral to creating you knowbuying the largest corporate renewableenergy purchase in 2019 to our current24 7 carbon free goals which are Superambitiousthis work not only leads the industrybut it really helps Drive larger systemschange and when you know you think ofGoogle's expertise and our mission it'sreally about making informationaccessible and useful for betterdecision making and So withinsustainability at Google we really thinkof it as three pillars of course on ouroperations as I mentioned but there'salso how do we Empower individuals howdo we Empower our partners which is whya lot of you might be here today soaddressing climate changeis really an information problem in manyways in fact in a report that wecommissioned in 2022 we found that 20 to25 percent of all of the initiativesthat the EU needs to do to reach theirdeep decarbonization goals have someform of digital enablement thereand for individuals and our partnersreally to drive that positive action forour planetit really means you know we need toaccess the billions of users that useour products every day with things likeeco-friendly routing air qualitymonitoring or putting the carbon numbernext to Google Flights and then theflights that people are purchasing italso means building new tools andplatforms so in 2010 we launched GoogleEarth engine a geospatial analysisplatform really to look at environmentalmonitoring in 2018 we launched theenvironmental insights Explorer toolfocused on bringing actionable data andinsights for thousands of cities aroundthe worldbut what's really important here is thatright nowconsumers are interested insustainability more than ever before in2022 searches forelectric vehicles electric bicyclessolar energy reached all-time highs andpeople around the world are reallyinterested in you know what how do Ilive more sustainably what's going onhere and that's spurred on by of courseextreme weather events local pollutionnew incentive programs it's also by thekind of critical mass of friends andfamilies and neighbors who have eitherhad some impact associated with climatechange or maybe have seen the benefitsof sustainable behaviors andTechnologies and so now really more thanever before this is the time when itmakes sense for businesses to offersolutions to Consumers that can helpinform and enable those sustainablechoicesenter Google Maps platform Google Mapsplatform is really about providing theinformation to developers based on themost up-to-dateaccurate and constantly evolvingunderstanding of the real world it's GMPenables organizations to create amazinggeospatial experiences you've probablyseen Google Maps in a lot of differentplaces for their users based on thetrusted information that we've beenbuilding within Google Maps for decadesand so when you combine these two oneGoogle's long-standing commitment tosustainability and GMP Google Mapsplatform is a developer platform that'swhy we're super excited to launch theenvironment category in GMP this isreally our first step towards making GMPGoogle Maps platform we'll keep usingthat acronym the leading destination fordevelopers to access unique hyper localsustainability and climate data andinsightsand today that's where we are launchingthree new apis solar API air quality andpollen that you'll hear a little bitmore about todaythese products apply Ai and machinelearning to environment data to givebusinesses helpful information that caninform consumers daily behaviors thatcan help inform purchasing decisions andcan make businesses operate moreuh more efficiently right reduce thetime and cost of doing businessand GMP of course offers the reliabilityand scale for develop for supportingdevelopers around the world it offersreally an ideal platform for us to bringto partner with developers and bringthat information to bear that willultimately help us address climatechangeso let me dive a little bit deeper intosolar itself that's the product I'vebeen working on for a number of yearsthe opportunity of course I have to saythis for solar is brighter than everreally residential and commercial solarin the last year makes up 50 percent ofall the expected growth in solar in 2023and in 2024 the International Energyagency predicts that 100 over 150gigawatts of solar energy will beinstalled that is tens of millions ofsystems around the worldand that's really fueled by policymakers who are setting this great policyenvironment through incentive programsespecially here in the US and Europe andand you know it helps get you knowsolars easy to install it happens reallyquick and it reduces the energy costburden for individual building ownersso what is you know what is this APIitself what we did is we took highquality imagery and Maps data we use AImodels to analyze that imagery tounderstand the details about theindividual roofs including the slopeobstructions shade patterns and then weadd in weather to understand what is thesolar potential what how much solarenergy will be produced by thoserooftopsand so we can we in the API we return itin two different formats one is the rawdata the raw data is an imagery layer soyou can see the actual house that you'regoing to be putting solar on it we giveyou a DSM a digital surface model whichis an elevation a pitch and shape of theroof itself as well as flux so sunninessand shade values across the entire yearfor that building and then we digestthose insights and we also produceanother endpoint which is really aboutthe insights of the building and solarpotential for a specific building thatyou you might be querying and this I'lltell you a little bit more about whythat's important but this is key solarinformation really at this like I needto need a quick hit what is the solarpotential of this buildingso the API is based on what we learnedfrom the project sunroof tool that welaunched in 2015 is a consumer face toolthat has helped countless homeownersaround the world understand whethersolar is right for them and we'reworking with industry Partners over thelast few years to understand what theyneeded to really accelerate theirbusinesses Drive customer trust andultimately deploy more solar so with ourexpanded coverage with the data andimagery that you need to createaccurative accurate and competitivesolar proposals we hope this increasesyour conversions reduces your number ofsite visits and decreases your sitedesign times for solar installationsthe API was designed to support usecases across the entire solarinstallation funnel from customerawareness to acquisition to panel layoutto design and installation guides youcan use the API to support specificbuildings but a specific building infront of a customer and say this is yourroof this is you know these are thepanels on your roof you know solar isright for you you can take that down alevel and put a distinct quote togetherthat says this is you need seven panelson your roof to and they're going to beon this corner of the roof you cancreate designs there and then you cancreate installation guides as well soyou can use the raw solar data to reallysay okay here's my installers you needto go to this part of the roof it's thistall then you bring that ladder withthem so it's everything from I have aportfolio of buildings which one's rightfor solar we can do that and it's downto the level of I need to put panelswhere that's what we're really excitedabout with with this toolso the solar API we're excited to launchit to 40 countries covering 320 millionbuildings this coverage supportsbusinesses and customers at scale helpsyou provide it gives you the ability toexpand your business into new marketswe're not done though we know newbuildings are coming up all the time weknow that they're interested indistributed solar on residentialcommercial roofs is not limited to thesecountries and we're super excited tohear more about what is needed in theworld how do we how do we helpaccelerate solar installers even more soif you have ideas I'm here to listen tothosebut to tell you a little bit more aboutsolar and how it's being used by one ofour customers I want to introduce usthank you thank you Celine thank you forhaving me hereummy name is and I will tell a story aboutclosing Gap but that's what we've beendoing the last couple of yearsbut we're on a mission to help theEuropean Union to achieve Montero peakof installed capacity in 2030. that'sour mission that's what we're working onand we're doing since 2009.to explain that I have two short storiesone about how we grew our company overthe last couple of years and the otherabout the complexity of the energymarket and what it meanswe started in 2009 a couple of mycolleagues they looked at certainproblems in the spatial planning areaand they also saw a question about solarand they looked at what kind of data wasavailable full available and how theycould use that and they saw there waslaser scanning data lidar data which istranslated now into a DSM model and theysaw building boundary data and hestarted thinking about it and he had theintuition they could build something ofit and it started with a first algorithmand for one building it took over a weekto calculate it well the end result wasgreat but a week then already was toomuch so they started improving improvingand in 2010 we got to the point that wecould calculate a complete City within aweek and share the results of that in asolar map to a municipality or city sothat the the inhabitants could see whatthe potential of the roof was that wasthe first start the main issue was thatwe needed to have data the data was notavailable it was always only availablethrough a governmental agency took a lotof time a lot of effort so we startedlooking for other source of data and in2014 there was a big moment the EuropeanUnion had a legislation thatmade sure that every country would beable should be able to provide the opendata there were two countries who didthat the Netherlands and Denmarkand we had some great results with thatand then we started waiting waitingwaiting for the other countries tofollow didn't happen and then Googlesunroof project was the next thing firststep for us because we saw that that'sanother alternative we already hadreference data sets which we could useto validate the date of Google and wesaw that it was good for what we wantedto do so we started with projects inGermany and the UK doing the same thingagainthen again before a lot more data becameavailable it took a lot of time so someof the countries in the EU gave dataavailable but still not enough and thenin 2022 the discussion with Googlestarted again and they decided theGoogle son of project will become acommercial product which was a greatdecision for Google but also for us inthe end and that led to us launching theMontero Peak initiative this year atintersol air Munich big solar InventionConventionthe other story is about the solarmarket and butumI already had solar panels on my roof in1996. I don't know who if you have solarpanels on the roof can you raise yourhandso still still a lot of people toconvert to using solar that's greatumum when I bought my house in 1996 it hadalready solar panels only because it waspart of the deal so it was not thatdifficult to buy them what you see hereis the blue line is the complexity ofthe market in it and during the lastcouple of years the complexity increaseda lot so new products without batterieswhether the heat pumps with it um if youlook at for instance the energycontracts that you can get so thecomplexity is but it's growing a lot andthe other thingpeople trusted the energy Market it waseasy to understand and that trustdeclined very fast to the point wherethere is now a gap between thecomplexity of the market and the trustthat people have in that market andthat's what we're closing we're closingthat Gapthat's for trying to establishand I have to click through this yesumanother part is what we saw that if theblue line is what kind of data isnecessary to give good advice toconsumers or to businessesum the initiative in the Nellis andDenmark made it possible to advise thosecountries really well and what'spossible in the other countries it wasreally difficult over small data sets alot of work to to do the data qualitychecks with the availability of theGoogle solar API that becomes a lot moreeasy for us to do so we can close thegap now at this moment but only at thismoment Saleem already said new buildingswill come new Solutions will be there soit is a challenge to keep ahead of thetrust versus complexity of the challengethat we're facingthat's the two stories that convergewhat we have done over the years is wehave created solutions for governmentsto educate on the potential of solar butalso for commercial companies to helpraise the conversion of their salesprocesses those are the really importantthings that we've done and we're doingthat with now with the new Google solarAPI far better faster than ever beforethis is what we have achieved so far inEurope and we're really proud of thatthat we have achieved that that's reallysomething that every time we look atthis figures we say wow but it's stillnot enough if you look in the room howmany people already have solar panelsit's not enough you have to be moresend them what do we have from technicalperspectivewe we know of each roof part the Tiltthe orientation we know the size and weuse that to estimate scenarios what isthe best option for your energyconsumption or your future energyconsumptionsum we know what objects are in theneighborhood and we can use that tocalculate how much Shadow there will beand how much actually the radiation willhit the roof partswe know we can create online real-timethe first indication of a solar plant isused in whether it's an educationalpurposes and also in commercialsituations to help to give the the fueland understanding what is possiblewe know the height and the height of thelowest roof part and also of the highestrule part the lowest Row part is reallyimportant to understandwhat's the height of the safety meshesthat you need to take into accountsafety measures are really necessary butalso very costly so explaining that toan installer is really importantwe know about the the situation aroundthe building which is important if youlook at from the perspective of theindividual who wants to buy a solarplant explaining this is your house thisis what the Shader will do and this iswhat the potential installation can behelps them into making the decision tobuy a solar plantand again these two stories now convertwhat we're trying to do every day everyweek is make sure that we close the gapbetween complexity and trust and makesure that that our customers with ourmunicipalities which are the commercialcompanies which are individuals use thatdata to start using Renewables andthat's for me thank you for nowthank you bossso from here we're going to switch tothe other apis we're launching today totell you more I'd like to introduce Ronkorber an environmental engineer who'salso the director of productthank you Celia according to the worldof organization air pollution is amongthe greatest environmental health riskwhich we face todaywhich accounts for more than 7 millionpremature death every yearalso due to climate change there is anincrease in going phenomenon of otherenvironmental hazards such as wildfiresand pollenthis all creates a huge Healthcare costand according to the World Bank the costof air pollution alone is more than 8trillion dollar annuallyin current times when health and climatechange is top of mind for individualsbusinesses and authorities everyconsumer experience every product andevery business process must becomeclimate over and climate resilientwhich is why we are very excited tointroduce the neural quality API and thenew ipolling API as part of the newenvironmental category on Google Mapsplatform alongside with solar API thisis all part of Google commitment makingreliable relevant environmental dataavailable to the masseswith the newer quality API in the newpollen API we don't only provideaccurate data but also heat mapcapabilities as well as recommendationson how to reduce exposure and yes thiscan all be available with easily tointegrate apis which can be used onevery new or current businessapplications or websites let me tell youmore about what is available via theapisair quality is a new capability thatprovides current and historical data theair quality apis provide granular airquality data to help innovate yourproduct and style your map in order tovisualize air pollution exposurethis enables people to understand theair they are within and make an informeddecision such as choosing the right parkthe cleanest Park to take the childrenoutside limiting out of stay or choosewhere and when to do other activitykey features include real-time airquality index which is hourly airquality information available in over100 countries at an astonishingresolution of 500 meter or 1600 feetresolutionalso available is a very intuitive airpollution map which is color-codedrepresentation of the air that we breedwe also provide other features such ashealth tips and recommendation which arehundreds of recommendations on how toavoid exposure based on seven populationsegments for example recommendation forasthma patients COPD patients athletesand moremoving on to Polandpolon is a natural phenomenon which alsohave a significant healthcost on society with over400 million seasonal allergy suffersgloballyin a world where Paul encounts arerising and Poland season are gettinglonger and at the same time aren'tpredictable there is an increase indemand for accurate pollen forecasttherefore the Poland API is a newcapability based on very Advanced modelsthat calculate the pollen index forthree Poland types and for up to 15pollen plant speciesthis is available on a one by onekilometer Square Grid in 65 countriesand yes just like the air quality APIPoland iopi also include heat mapcapabilities which you can display ontop of your Google Mapsa variety of Industrythe pollen and air quality apis andthose Industries include Smart HomeHealthcare Mobility travel governmentmedia and big Tech real estate insuranceand more and I will be happy to give youa couple of examplesin the healthcare market for example theMongol customers are medical companiesand pharmaceutical companiesfor seasonal allergy suffersthere are good news because there aretreatment that can be efficient in orderto prevent or avoid related symptomshowever this are mostly efficientif taken before allergic symptoms startso among the use cases there are appsthat provide alerts for seasonal allergysuffers so for example if we see thatpollen count might be high it's a userlocation according to a forecast theseapps will run this user this patient inorder for him to make informed decisionon how to reduce exposure for exampleclosing the windows at his home or evenuse his personal preventative medicineit is also no surprise that exposure toair pollution during our daily commutemight have a negative impact on ourhealthso therefore in the mobility andautomotive industry air qualityimportant data allow for more informeddriving decisionspassenger and drivers can use the datato find alternative route to reduceexposure they can also make otherinformed decisions such as turn on thein-cabin air purifier in Del columnthe air quality in Poland API can beeasily integrated into the car HMI aswell as a driver companion app so thedriver can make sure the car is preparedand optimized before the Journey Beginsnext Emil Fisher director of researchand Engineering at Google will elaboratemore on the unique Dynamic of airpollution and how we are able to provideaccurate environmental data Emil thanksokay thanks Juan sohi everybodyokay so people sometimes wrongly assumethat they are exposed to pollution onlywhen they are located to uh really nextto a pollution Source such as if theyare next to a busy traffic jam or youknow or a wildfire but actually thereality is a bit different people it canbe also exposed to flower pollutionsources such as dust storms that cantravel great distance and can causeoceans and even continentsOkay soyou can see here time lapse videopresentation of the air quality changesin the Bay Areayou can see how wherehow their quality changes you know fromone street to another and and and ofcourse you can see the colors the colorsrepresents a green represents gooderquality which is healthy for everybodyyellow represents a moderated airquality which can be harmful forsensitive groups just like you knowasthma patients and red representsbetter quality which is harmful foreverybody even for short exposure oftimes less than one houras you can see the air quality changesdramatically from one street to anotherfrom a from one hour hour to another andand from good to bedso as you can seethis is very this is also verychallenging to map the pollution at yourexact locationand andand and there are several reasons forthat one is delays in reporting and alsoa coverage between sensorscool so to resolve this to resolve thischallenge we are using sophisticatedalgorithms and and what we're doing weare fusing multiple data layers we aretaking we are taking traffic informationwe are taking weather conditionsdifferent models we are using a firesmoke models Etc to calculate thepollution in more than 100 countries ina resolution as well mentioned of around500 meters which is around 1600 feetthis unique approach enables us toprovide information even when one of thedata sources is unavailable we calculatethe pollution in around 500 milliongeographical locations around the worldin those locations we calculate thepollution of the pollutantconcentrations of billions of differentpollutant concentration types SPM 2.5 PMtens and and others and overall wedigest terabytes of data and we alsosupport more than 70 different airquality indexes basically those areofficial governmental Global air qualityindexes that we can provide anywherealso a similar approach we are takingwith the Poland modeling or Polandforecasting we use Infuse multiple datalayers such as land cover and totalproduction per pollen type and climatedata and then we are able to providemeaningful information such as pollenindex which is a universal and Globalpollen index we can also provideexposure exposure risks actionableinsights and heat Mapsso you're asking yourself why now soaccording to the World HealthOrganization air pollution is one of thebiggest environmental health risks thisis why the who took a bold action and inthe first time in 16 years they reducedtheir air pollution thresholds andupdated their guidelinesthis creates a lot of sense of urgencyamong governments companies and peopleand also the news coverage about airpollution pollen and wildfires changedrastically and there are now as you seeeverywhere also we see that many worldleaders and the CEOs of large companiesthey'll focused themselves on onrealizing sustainabilityso I'm really excitedto announce the general availability ofour new air quality and pollen apis aspart of our new also environmentalproduct Suite available via Google mapsplatform if your company is looking tobring real value to your users toincrease brand loyalty and trust andincrease engagement and help yourcommunities so their quality and pollingapis were created exactly for that tosupport multiple business segmentsacross many health related use casesthat again to bring real value to yourusers thank you"
