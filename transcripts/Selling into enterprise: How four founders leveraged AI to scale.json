conference it's thetrue the proud the committed that areshowing up today and that's you so wereally appreciate you doing that forthose of you in the back feel free tocome forward I made sure to wear alittle bit of extra cologne today so uhand tend to have good hygiene so feelfree to uh to head up if you'd like toI'm really excited for the time that wehave with you today because we're goingto spend some time with three incredibleFounders that are really solving verycomplex problems they're doing so in avery unique way and so what we're goingto do today is have a pretty free-formconversation if that's all right with afocus on a little bit of tech a littlebit of capital raising a little bit oflessons learned a little bit onleadership and for those of you that arestartup Founders yourselves ideallyyou'll take at least one solid nuggetaway from what is definitely someincredible leadership here on the stageso I'm really excited for the time thatwe have with you so thanks again forthatso let me do a quick introduction sothat you can have an ideaof who's here I am not Braun by the wayum so just did want to let you know thatuh I am Darren Mori and I get to lead abusiness here in North America focusedon our startup organization creating ahigh level of service and a greatsupport model for our Founders the threefolks that I have here on stage are thereally this the center of the show todayand I want to go through and one quicklyjust tell you about or at leastintroduce aparna and Lynn and Mona butrather than me take the wind out oftheir sales I'd much rather start withthem having the chance to tell you aboutthem giving you a little bit of an ideaof the companies that they've startedand the problems they're solving so ifit's all right a partner I'll start withyou awesome can you all hear me hear youperfectly perfect okay so hey everyonemy name is aparna uh one of the foundersat arise arise was founded in 2020series bum and I should I go into like why Istarted arise yeah tell us a little bitabout arise if you would and then we'llget into that yeah so arises and mlobservability platform so we helpmonitor AI troubleshoot when it doesn'twork and then help you root cause whyyour models aren't performing the waythat they should be I got into thisproblem because I was an ml engineer formany years most recently at Uber Ilaunched a lot of models so if you'veever taken an Uber ride and your ETAwasn't right yeah that's probablysomeone on my team and we deployed a lotof models into production and just likesoftware when you deploy models into thereal world they may not go as expectedand we only found out about that when welost Revenueum and so felt the pain myself gotpulled into many meetings to helpexplain why our models weren't workingand that's what got me to want to starta company around ml observability so theelevator pitch is datadog for ML I loveit that's perfect hey Mona if youwouldn't mind doing the same thingshould I take her elevator pitch and saydate a dog for data yeah there you goperfect okayco-founder CEO of tell my tell my is adata observability uh company so I had adifferent pitch but I'll first try totell how different are we so from uppernow so first thing is when you arebringing in data you have complex datapipeline from ingestion to consumption alot of this consumptions could be yourml model across the pipeline a myriad ofthings can happen and we help apply AItechniques to check your data foranomalies errors outliers uh termitestwo and a half year companies eightStage Company uh both Max and me myco-founder Max low kitchen we had spenta lot of time in the data ecosystem andwhat we realized that in spite of thespend in data infrastructure companiesstruggle to get the right Roi on thedata because they don't have the trustin the data that's fueling your ML andAi and analytics use cases so we startedwe got heads on into this got cedron thefunding have great customers and we havepartnership built across snowflakedatabricks Googlethat's my quick introduction excellentand Lynn I had the chance to meet youand we had a session on demystifying AII really appreciate that it feels likeit was years ago but it was yesterdayjust so you know when we did thatsession but I'd love for you to tellthese folks what you've been working onand all about uh fireworks yeah sure andI feel I can integrate with both of yourcompaniesso we are building Integrations righthereso I'm Lynn I'm a co-founder CEO offireworks.ai our focus is to lift allfictions for product Engineers createproduct disruption Beauty on top of jnaithe biggest friction we are liftingfirst is deploy General models intoproduction because those models areextremely big compared with traditionalmachine learning models extra boost inregression is a huge and the traditionalinfrastructure are not equipped to driveperformance and drive cost to servethose are the typical questions we heardfrom so many companies and they tune themodel the Train the model is goodquality but they just got blocked Ideployed these models into productionwhen their business scales into hugeamount of users and they run into aproblem because the cost is so high andthen you can to get so much higher Roito justify the benefit of using thosemodels so we help them to completelyremove that concerns and we deliver thebest of the breed performance and thecost to serve because the background wehave here is I led pytorch team and MATAin the past five years I startedfireworks with a group of Engineerspytorch Engineers they have beenbuilding python code forever and in thegnai space all these models are hightouch models we feel kind of ourexpertise has been used to extreme to tohelp our product Engineers to beproductive in this spaceexcellent thank you so muchI want to dig in Mona Mable we'll startwith you if that's all right and we'lltalk about the the concept of obviouslystartups go through a life cycle and ajourney and that upfront Journey focusedon kind of concept and ideation to firstproduct to kind of getting that mvpshipped is obviously a super criticalstage can you share a little bit ofinsight with folks in the room aroundthat stage that process for you and howdid you transition from concept toproductabout the problem statement haven'tworked in data ecosystem my co-founderhad worked at observability for ourinfrastructure observability companysignal effects so we had ideas of how tosolve it we had understanding ofcustomers pain point but some wise mantold me that you should talk to five tenpeople still even though you may have alot of conviction keep validatingconstantly I do that even till nowwe wanted to optimize for Pace fastright so I'm proud to say even ourprototype was built on gcp to be honestlike uh gke and started so we wanted tofocus on what we want to validate firstso we started building a prototype whichreally focuses on can we use statisticsmachine learning to detect anomalies andfigure out at scale what's going wrongwith the data so we use the servicesfrom gcp built out a prototype we usebigquery uh looker we literally pushedout our dashboards to customers tovalidate we didn't build anything so weused local dashboards to even validatewith customers to take real-timefeedback and then started designpartnering and building out and launchthe product so we did a lot of like uhworking together with our customersbefore we launched anything into themarket so that was optimizing for fastleveraging focusing on what you knowbest and validating that first andleveraging ecosystem for other thingsthat's what we did and that's how westarted that's great thank you for thatinsight and a partner maybe same to youwhen you think about the journey thatyou took your company through in theearly stage what would be a couple ofinsights or lessons learned that youcould share with these folks aboutconcept to first productyeah I don't even know where to startthere's so manyum so I think there's one thing which isinteresting so there's selling to theEnterprise and then they're selling AIand for usthe the key nuances is like well who'sdoing AI it's typically not a startupthat are three or four people like whenyou think about like that y combinatorhey sell to other startups and then youslowly will eventually build up andyou'll sell to bigger and biggerEnterprises I think for data and AIcompanies you have to think about wellwho has your problems and for usprobably larger Enterprises who have ourproblems I mean there are mid-market andwe do have mid-market customers startupcustomers but I thinka vast majority are probably in theEnterprise kind of group and what anEnterprise needI think the there's you know rolling outan MVP is important but there's a lotmore that goes into selling into anEnterprise than just having an MVP halfBank productum and so similar to Mona we alsostarted on Google Cloudum gke especially like my CTO would sayhe didn't even need an operations teamwhen he first began because whatever youwould have had four or five Engineersdoing gke just helped him quickly get upand get runningum but we we shipped fast like that'sthe first thing you could do is like getyour product out fast test it as quicklyas you can on the market we dideverything from even if we just hadfigma mocks we would go and show figmamocks to potential customers and saythis is what's rolling out this iswhat's coming out and um I think ithelped us kind of even though we thoughtwe had an idea of what we what we wantedto build I had felt the pain myself it'sdifferent when you pitch it to like monosaying 10 15 other ml Engineers or datascientists and they start to make youthink oh maybe the way I thought of thesolution in the beginning isn't rightand so the quicker we got the productout the more feedback we got out I thinkfast as possible to shipping to test itwas really important for usum so so that's more on like thetechnical the product building I thinkthere's a whole component of like go tomarket that is a technical founder youjust have never done beforeum and so how did you go about gettingthat Assistance or knowing what youneeded to know to perfect that go tomarket yeah so I I think the first thingwe I really tried to do was like wellwho's our customerum when you're selling to AI Enterprisesum it was early in the market therewasn't a there's two types of companieslike to think there's category definedcategory created and then there's kindof like category I don't know just maybeit's like a next-gen or disrupting socategory creating is that there's noproduct on the market like yours beforeso you have tocreate a need if there's not a budgetfor a product like yours and so what wehad to do wasumuh who was our buyer well our buyer weknew our user was going to be mlengineer and data scientists they're thepeople who own if models break inproduction or they don't perform as wellin the real world they have to own theconsequences but who makes the who's theeconomic buyer who's going to ultimatelybuy a product like that and so westarted to realize that you could selltoum call it ml platform teams so theseare kind of like you know when you havedevops uh devops centralization whichhas happened we we had kind of similarIndustries to look at and say wellthere's centralization of ml platformsthat could be one buyer or we could juststart to sell to one team and theneventually grow and eventually you knowbe the solution across an entireEnterprise and so I think it takes awhile as as a technical founder tofigure out what's your go to marketstrategy what's your how are you goingto reach developers and that that thatI'd say is uh is you want to get insimilar to shipping product it's alsohow quickly can you shape your messaginghow quickly rate over and over iteratingover and over and so that's that'sanother train of iteration that's kindof happening in parallel I think that'spowerful we talk so much abouttechnology iteration to your point anduh the flywheel of change and beingcustomer-centric from a product andcapability perspective a great reminderthat your go to market and your valueprop should equally be iterating at thesame Pace Linda kind of Off Script rightand same question for you when you thinkabout the early days of you creatingyour go to market strategy how did youthink about the same sorts of pointsthat uh that a partner raised ofidentifying the buyer identifying theneed and building your first quote go tomarket how did you approach thatuhyou don't know the mistakesmistakes along the way isum I think the mistakes are basicallybecause of lack of data I I think thisis very profound shift to be a startupCEO rather than in a mature company thehuge difference is in mature company youhave huge amount of data you canoptimize to the extremeum in terms of strategy look back andforth and trade-offs but in a startupoftentimes there's not enough dataif you want to be extremely data driventhen you get into another analysisparalysis situation so a lot of time wehave to try and understand by try andunderstand what is our ideal customerprofileand hey this conversation take way toolong and the conclusions they areactually not our customerthe team incentive doesn't alignor the budget is actually not therethere's just pure interest or orsomething else so so that helps usreally understand the parameters weshould operate within and the second ishelp us also understand where is ourstrength in the market and we havehypothesis when we start the company ofcourse but only by going out there andhave those conversations then the realvalue start to service I think with allthose mistakes it's really hard toreal estate assets what's the biggeststrength of our company so right now weestablished us as the leading vendor inperformance optimization and cost toserve and because the value isum hey there's really low entrance to togetting to Janai for part iteration andpart of scaling and we even offer ourproduct for free at app.fireworks.ai andif you're interested for free to try itoutand it's running on 100 gpus thanks togcpso it's all for for you to try andconstantly getting feedback isdefinitely a completely agree with thatand the feedback is interestingEnterprise sometimes move quite slowlybut we still manage to get in very deepengagement with them and constantlygetting feedback because once we getpast thestage of talking to ctOS head of infohead of AI head of inch had a productthen we are really talking withdevelopers and engineers and they arevery blunt and they give really goodfeedbackI like how you slipped your go to marketright into your answer and gave everyonethe the URL they can go hit to starttrying so well done you've clearly donethis a number of times I appreciate thatthere's only one point I just add shereminded me of this there's really gooduh I don't know phrase I guess onFounder Twitter which is uh first timeFounders care about productsecond time Founders care aboutdistribution and not the second timeFounders don't care about product but Ithink distribution matters interestingmatters a whole lotum and then the one other thing I wasgoing to say was on the distributionnote your firstfive to ten customers matter a lot onthe direction of your productum I I think theythey could make or break how yourtrajectory goes rightum and so your first five to tencustomers I I thinkdifferent different companies have gonedifferent strategies about thisum like 8 a well-known company out thereamplitude went a very different strategywere they focused on the top productcompanies and then you have othercompanies that went the bottoms upapproach where they'll start withhearing from startups first right andthen they bleed into Enterpriseum I think for us because we're againselling to Enterprises as Emerald mlobservabilityum I think we were really lucky to havesome top AI companies kind of be ourearly customersum and that I think was was reallyhelpful in in nailing out kind of thatcore value prop and the product sodistribution distribution distribution Ilove it I actually love that phrase thatas I hear the three of you talking Itjust strikes me thatum you're all three founders but it'sclear you're also all three Trailblazersin the sense of you know you're not noneof you have created a product wherethere's a lot of other people doing whatyou're doing none of you are pickingtechnology that's super well understoodin the industry and so kudos to allthree of you I think it's superimpressive andum clearly uh you like big challengesand so it's great it's great that you'reall doing that if I can pivot us alittle bit away from product and kind ofgo to market and talk about anothertopic that I'm sure those folks in theroom that are either Founders or seekingto be Founders care about and that iscapital and so I'm curious maybe Mona wecould start with you to share whateveryou're comfortable sharing when it comesto how did you think about raisingcapital and if you could you know thetop one or two lessons that you couldimpart with these folks from a ventureperspective would be great sure so firstthing is we bootstrapped it me and myco-founder we wanted to feelpassionately about what we did so everyfounder does that we bootstrapped uhwith the cash that we had saved werealized if you're building a productfor Enterprise you're going to run outof cash very quickly so step two was yeswe would need cash so we had toprototype something prove it out we werelucky we got into y combinator so thatwas where our first check external checkcame from and then we started going outto do I've done fundraising in tools uhlike before the market kind of going uhdown and then I raised one round earlierthis year in the tough market so I'veseen it both so I'm not going tosugarcoat this this Market is hard tofundraise but the good news is you canstill fundraise if you have a very goodidea which has a good product Marketapproachthe validations is key I would say lookfor right validations of like eitherthrough customer adoption uh customersintend to buy showing the marketpotential that helps a lot that helpedme a lotI also feel fundraising is a little bittricky it's almost like sales uh aparnawas talking about like Channeldistribution as a Founder you're most ofthe time selling everythingfor talent right you want top launchTalent you want to raise fund so you areselling your vision how your product isdifferent all of that so takefundraising as a sales exercise to behonest segment the VCS you want to lookafter look at the VCS who have investedin the companies who understand yourecosystem right if you are a datainfrastructure Company please go tocompanies or seed stage if you're inseed stage look at companies who areseed stages and who have invested ingood data infrastructure movement thatwill make your conversation much moreeasier you will not feel disappointedbecause it's not a no for a no sometimesthey're very different and they are notthe right ICP in this context also foryou so that's the approach that workedfor me personally segmenting finding theright type of Ventures right stage ofcompanies that they invest in companieswho take that leap of faith onfirst-time Founders that's alsoimportant and like just go at it likesales and and raise the funding and ifyou have which I highly recommend aco-founder so business as usual somebodyis working on the other side of thehouse and you can work on fundraisingbecause they take timesamazing you know one of the thingsaparna that you mentioned and if youdon't mind I'll piggyback off of acomment and ask you Len this questionand then give you some time to thinkabout your answer so giving you a breakhere in a in a world where you'resolving problems that haven't beensolved before in a world where inaddition to customers Venturecapitalists are also learning about Aiand learning about the problem and Lynnthis is the question I'd ask you toanswer for for fireworks how did you goabout raising your first round your in aworld where the people providing you themoney may not also really understandwhat it is that you're trying to do inthe first place how did you approachthat and then a partner would love tohear from you as wellso my first one that's very interestingand I only raised the first one round sospeaking of my experienceumI got connected with a investor througha friendand I think the investor immediatelyfall in lovewith uh with the idea I haveum partly because I thinkI don't think I have any secret sauceit's more like articulation of uservalueandthe market size and the Tailwind hadwinged and I can explain in depthtowards that soso and and then that goes pretty smoothI thinkit's it's and as shown with my friend II talked with the investor he's shockedwhy you start with that investor youprobably should it's like interview youshould interview with some more companybefore you hit that one and I'm I don'tknow anything but it seems it went wellI think theI did homework and I I maybe it'ssomething interesting to share thehomework I did is I worked with a veryexperiencedumsmaller investor who basically have seena lot of pitch deck and understand howto speak in investors language andbasically because I'm an engineer youknow how to kind of you know properlypaint the story that investors canunderstand to down to a point they don'thave a lot of the background inspecialty that we have and you know notto speak to the details which they kindof will threw them off but really helpedunderstand the business case and themarket size and whyWhy Us why now answer these questionsvery well and then the rest should bevery easy basically he helped meestablish a communication Channel withthe investors I think that's reallyhelpful if you can find someoneespecially if a first time founder inthe first round if I can find someonewho can help you shape up your pitchdeck to me it's tremendously usefulgreat a partner what about from yourperspective same question how did youraise that first round in a world thatmaybe didn't understand you yeah no goodgood question soum so so far I've raised three roundsour seat our series air series B eachround I feel like was a different thingthat you're you're trying to prove seedyou're trying to proveto be honest Market how big is themarket for a product like yours at thisstage to be honestI feel like what most investors arelooking for is like do you have thebackground it's kind of like foundermarket fit are you a right founderfor this market and how big is yourMarketto be honest the bigger the marketthe better the hope for the investorthat you're going to kind of fumble yourway around and you'll find a need inthis market and so Market's always moreimportant I'd say and so for me the umAI space that that's kind of I I youknow I thinkmy seed round was a lot of here's theneed had felt the need before here'sother people here's more people like meI am one ml engineer but there's I thinkat that point it was like the third orfourth fastest growing job on LinkedIn ajob role on LinkedIn and so if you couldprove heysimilar to how DBT was the product fordata analysts it's kind of like will yoube the product for ML engineers and socan you attach your different companiesgo about it in different ways but areyou going to be a product for a role areyou going to be this function will bedone by this product and so what's yourMarket uh and how big is it and are youthe right founder to solve that market Ithink by series a you're starting to getinto do you have proof points of yourvalidation so do you have enough of aspread of good logos andum what's your how much are peoplewilling to pay for a product like yourproductum and so for us like you want a spreadof I think good logos because thequality of the logos matters you alsodon't want like a big whale deal that'sthat's you know most of your Revenue youwant to show that there's multiplediversity of people purchasing yourproductum and it's okay if you're like hey I'mgonna only focus for our first yearum we focused entirely on what do youcall uh you know call it fintechsum and call it Tech first Enterprises sothink about it like the etsy's theWayfarers those were kind of like ourumStitch fix like those were kind ofcompanies were like they're Tech firstthey definitely have ml these arecompanies that we're going to focus onandum I think that that if you can kind ofshow hey this is a vertical even if youmay not you might be vertical agnosticbut you can kind of prove we've testedthis vertical we've tested that verticaland you know you're kind of showingproof that you're the the kind ofhypothesis that you had and when you'reraising your seed you've kind ofvalidated some of that that's right andthen by the time I feel like you getyour B it becomes about can you scaleyour business in an economic way and soI I think what are you trying to provein each round and can you clearly proveitum is isyou know I I think something that umI didn't realize until we were likegoing through the motions of doing ityeah I think that's incredibleexperience and having three rounds nowunder your belt and you're a bit of anexpert now so thank you for sharing thatand I hope that success continues foryouum so let's continue uh from a productperspective before we run out of timeone of the things that we promised wasthat talking about identifying a bigproblem iterating around customerrequirements to release a great productbut I would love for you to say what'scoming next and so would you each mindif you're able to share a little bitabout what your customers can expectfrom your product and maybe give us someinsight into behind the curtain what'scoming next so Linda you maybe want tostart from a fireworks perspectiveput you on the spot yeah definitelyto be honest but so I hope productsmainly focus on developer productivityand kind of if we when we think aboutthe product developers we really lookinto think them into two cohorts one isthey are in part of Market fit provingphase validation phase and in that phasewhat's most important is speed upiteration that means hey whatever isgetting the way and slowing them downthat we need to remove those in terms ofso where where they do they spend timeone is hey they have a business problemat hand they don't know how to decomposethat into AI problems that's the firstwhich I model to use and then how do Ifind two models is a black magicand then after I find you how do I eventest that and test my product experiencehow to deploy so we want to really makethese iteration fast so that's theproblem we are in the process of solvingthat's what's coming next is really makethe whole experiment product experimenton jnai going really really really fastwhat we have like a good handle on isactually the second phase the outer loopthe outer loop is once you have aproduct Market fit you add a scale of atthe stage of scaling to a lot more usersand then you're about a different kindof problem you are about performancestability reliability uh cost to serveall this problem business problem willcome into picture so we we chose tosolve the second problem first becausewe feel that's a much bigger barrierum and it's much easier for us toidentify the distribution channel forthosestakeholders so that's that's why wesolve the outer loop problem firstand I think as I just mentioned I thinkfireworks is one of the best vendorswhen it comes to Performance scalabilityand cost to serve so if you are in thesecond category you would love for youto try our platform but we are alsoum heading towards solving the InnerCircle problem to make if you're in theproduct Market feed stage building ontop of jnai Welcome to Roll Out productthat you can also use and please give usfeedback excellent Mona what about foryou what's coming next what can youshare with uswe have fantastic launch comingtonight tradewe also I trade on go to market werealize the Enterprises is where we wantto sit Enterprises where that adoptionis going to be highest so what do theycare about they definitely care aboutbeing easy where they get their othercloud services so we launched onMarketplace last week that's a firstthing that they'll start they'll be ableto use their gcp credits to leveragetell my and especially given it's a newcategory everybody's learning how thisproduct is going to sit into theecosystem so that adoption barrier isgoing to be easy secondly we are goingto uh have tell my in your accounts gcpaccounts running we were a public SASoffering but now tell Michael run inyour environment whether it's AWS gcpAzure so we launched that and we've alsoadded a lot of feature functionalitieswhich makes it easy so we call thisrelease we are calling it moreEnterprise adoption uh release so whichis AI functionalities like Enterpriseshave heterogeneous systems in their datapipelines they have multiple systems ina single data pipeline we are going tosupport all these different systemreading data from that in theirecosystemchecking for data drifts acrossdifferent system where is the datamissing so those type of functionalityand another exciting one is data binningso especially when you're training yourmodels large data large language modelsor be it your traditional machinelearning models you need to profile thedata understand how much of this data isgood bad and whether it's from costperspective or model performanceperspective you you want to separateyour bad data from good data from thepipeline so that will be also launchedin this release so a lot of excitingstuff we're continuously buildingcontinuously learning and making it easyfor folks to adopt products like tell myamazing excellent now parno what's upnext all right well we started 2020 onML observability at that point llmswasn't wasn't a thing so earlier thisyear we launched support for llmobservability so I feel like every weekI talk to somebody in c-suite of somecompany and they're telling us theirnumber one most important use cases toget out a generative application a lotof them by the way are using Google's uhpom2 text by Sun 2. so we launchedsupportum actually just this week forum kind of building on top of all of ourllm launches to now do prompt iterationprompt monitoringand also troubleshootuh retrieval augmented generation youknow the the proprietary data thatpeople are adding into their prompts soif you're pulling in irrelevantproprietary data into your prompts youcan now observe that troubleshoot itdrill down into what's wrongum and then fix that and all of this isalso available on our open sourceproduct as well amazing that's greatit's great to see the level of iterationand the new announcements so thanks forgiving us a little bit of the peekbehind the curtain let's kind of bringus home with one final question and umMona maybe I'll start with you and thatis of the folks here in this room whomay be thinking of or in their earlydays of starting a company focused onproviding a capability to an Enterprisethat will kind of be a bit of a key whatis the number one you have to pick onethe number one piece of advice that youwould share with individuals In ThisCrowd about starting that company andbeing successful I know it's hard topick one but I'm gonna ask you to pickone but I'm going to tell a very simpleanswer just start likenothing it's exciting than starting acompany doing something that you believein and this is the perfect time I meanthe ecosystem the support there istremendous amount of it don't overthinkthis just jump into it do it there's nofailures okay there's only learnings andstartup Journey there's no failures I'vespoken to so many Founders even the topFounders who have built multi-billiondollar type of companies have failed andembraced failures and so it is a journeyand learn from that but just get startedincredible that's amazing advice thankyou Lynn what about from you the singlepiece of advice most important advicebuild trustso uhlike look at the Enterprise right sothey are not agile they're kind of notlike startup moving really fast and kindthey canswitch dependencies quickly and so onEnterprise has a long process to makethose decisions and for Enterprise touse a startup especially early stagestartup they are creating dependencieson on the rising company who are yet toprove the reputationso um I think for there a lot of theirdecision making is based on how muchtrust they have uh how much validationthey have how much they trust this teamis going to deliver high quality productand so on I I personally feel likeum it takes time to to build that trustto build that reputation and you lendone and then you know you can build ontop of that and this is a process it'sit's kind of cannot be rushedum it just you just have to have thepatience to kind ofum grind through that and get to levelthat you have proven your value towardsmultiple ones and then you can build ontop of that so I I feel it's kind oflike building a pyramid you have alittle Foundation step by step and thenkind of build on top of itexcellent thank you a partner cool noit's easy velocity whatever you can doto maintain velocity that's your secretsauce as a startup at the end of the dayyou're just going to move100 times faster than a large Enterprisemaybe a thousand times and so everysingle decision that you make thinkabout it asumis this you know how do I is thishelping me move faster and that could befrom I'll give a Google plugum because you guys invited me so nicelybut you know everything from like youknow setting up infra our engine pickedGoogle Cloud because you don't have tohave a big large team as you scale Ithink the faster that you can get up andget your entire stack up running isimportantum I think as fast as you can get aproduct out to Market is important andthen I think there's kind of like apersonal Journey you go through rightyou're never great at everything whenyou first startyou have many weaknesses and so figureout your own velocity of where you weakat and how do you get better at that andfor many of the technical Founders hereit might just be go to market and solike how how quickly can you increaseyour own velocity toyou know pitch and get 20 pitches in asquickly as possible I think that thatkind of makes or breaks you early onthat's incredible what I findinteresting about the way all three ofyou wrap this up is that's good justlife advice frankly so what I'm takingaway and I'm not the founder of astartup is just get started don'toverthink it and be willing to acceptthe risk of potentially not doingsomething perfectly and move forwardbuild trust with the people that you'rebuilding the company with and you'rebuilding the company for realizing thatpeople are always going to make a bet onyou and that trust is going to matterand move freaking fast right and dothings as quickly as you can and bewilling to break a little bit of glass Ithink that's incredibly powerful forFounders incredibly powerful forTrailblazers which as I said I reallybelieve all three of you are and eventhose of us in the room that are notFounders or Trailblazers that's advicewe can take and
