what are we talking about today to dothat I just want to do a quick show ofhands um how many of you in this room donot know or have not heard of VPCservice controlsokay one okay there's a fewum that's goodumthe reason for the question was to makesure how much of time I need to spend onthe introduction this these sessions arebeing recorded so uh United anyway do anintroduction on the technology but whatyou're going to do in the next30 odd minutes is to Deep dive into whatVPC service controls are as I'll Nowcall it vpcsc isuh why it is one of the more popularsecurity controls coming out of GoogleCloud Stables and how it is evolvingthen I'll hand the session off toChristian Christian Gorky uh who is thevice president and head of cyber Centerof Excellence at Commerce Bankhe'll walk you through his his bank'sJourney with vpcsc and how it provides aunique value proposition and dataexfiltrationso about me uh my name is srirambalasubramanian I go by SRII am a senior product manager here atGoogle andas you begin this session I want tostart off with a quick congratulationsto everybody in the roomthe folks in the room are herebecause you're all highly attuned to therisks of data exfiltrationand the challenges encountered insecuring dataI shouldn't have to say this but dataexfiltration is a costly problem foralmost all organizationsthe reasons are manybut what is important to keep in mind isthat data acceleration happens notbecause of the absence of securitycontrolsin fact it happens in spite of strongcontrols because ultimatelymisconfigurations can happenvulnerable code continues to show upcredentials get stolen or leakednow to put an analogy into this you knowwhen you have with your vehicle you havea collection of safety controlsbut among all of this one way to thinkof what a data acceleration control isis like a child lock for a car dooryou know just as you want your preciousCommodities in this case probably yourkids or anybody else who are in the backseat you want to control when they leavethe vehicle you similarly want to havecontrols around how and when data goesout of your organizationthis will ensure that data doesn't justleave an organization in the event of acompromise caused by one of thesefactorsI'm sure you've all heard of thewell-known stories of Defense in depthand security layers of onionso on and so forthat Google We Believe security is ashared responsibility and we follow ashared responsibility model herewe work to secure our networks and ourinfrastructure and our goal is toprovide customers the tools necessary todo so on your own projects at manyvarious levels of the networks trackwhether it's from an infrastructureperspective networking perspectiveidentity perspective internet facingapplication perspective and so on and soforthhowever when building a stack and werealize this uh two three years agothat most organizations have thechallenge when it comes to defendingagainst exfiltrationyou know the problem is typicallyaddressed by making a determination togo off internetand use tools like caspi secure webproxies or other proxies for anyinternet access and even have controlledaccess therehowever if there is an attack Vectorthat is targeting your multi-tenantCloud delivered servicesit is extremely hard to use a secure webproxy or even go off internet anduse that as a vehicle to prevent thatprimarily because it is almostimpossible to separate what islegitimate access versus what is anExcel attemptyou can at that point only be as secureas your credentials or configuration isthis is the problem that VPC servicecontrols aims to solveit aims to provide youfor Google multi-cloud uh apis orServices API level exfiltration controlsinit to put it simply and I'm going tothrow a few buzzwords here VPC servicecontrols is a zero trust based Cloudoffers security Centric model forpreventing data exfiltration frommulti-tenant Google servicesJusticeNetwork Identity or device controls butoperate as an overlay on top of allthese boundaries and working inconjunction with other security controlsas I mentioned to you API basedacceleration is the most common way bywhich bulk data exfiltration happens inorganizations so it functions bycontrolling and restricting APAcommunication for Google managedServices across the three paths forservice access which is internet toservice other VPC networks to theservice and service to servicehow it does this at its basic level isit operates by creating an abstractboundary around the group of resourcesand services that you want to protect wecall this a vpcsc perimeter once createdresources within the perimeter are freeto talk to each other however all APAaccess that spans perimeter boundariesgets blockedin such a scenarioany credential theft misconfigurationthat could allow data movement acrossthe perimeter is rejected by vpcscwe however realize that this kind of abinary state of allow inside theparameter and denied outside theparametermight be too restrictive for legitimateaccess partsto support that we built into vpcsc whatwe call directional rules that allow youto explicitly permit the flow of apisfor a particular service in eitherdirection from outside the parameter toinside or from inside to outsidethese rules are very powerful and allowyou to ensure granular granular leastprivileged access to your servicesplease keep in mind you don't use vpcscand then say Oh I don't need myfirewalls anymorethis works in conjunction it focuses ona particular Threat Vector and it doesits job very wellnow how do we make this happen what arethe building blocks of vpcsc uh firstand and I think there's a step that Idid not mention in the slide isfirst I I you need to sit with yourteams and figure out various sensitivedata is in most cases you'll probablystart withum a bigquery data set a GCS bucket or acollection of buckets but identify whichdata sets you are worried about leavingyour environmentonce you identify that identified a setof resources and services that areconnected to that that you want toprotectyou could Define these uh as projectsand or VPC Networksyou then create an abstract parameter aperimeter is just an abstraction it'snot something that's set in stone it'san abstract it's an abstract boundarythat you create around all theseprojects and servicesonce you create this parameter next stepis to figure out which Services you wantto restrict in the parameter those arethe only services that will berestricted by vpcscmy recommendation here is to read whatwe publish in google.com calledsupported Servicesdocument or our supported Services pagearound vpcsc before you start to roll itout this is important because what isunique about vpcsc is not only does itrestrict what we call Visible accesspaths where a particular user or aworkload access service it also controlsservice to service access Parts if weperceive that that could be a way bywhich data can be extracted from aperimeterso what is this would mean is forservices it would in it would createadditional restrictions on how aparticular service can be used with thegoal of threat exfiltration preventionin mindno there is a Next Step called VPCaccessible Services I'll skip it for amoment and I'll come back to it nowbeyond that that's when you you have todecide once this parameter is createdare there legitimate access flows that Ineed to permit and that's where ourdirectional rules come into play thesedirectional rules are extremely granularyou can restrict it at an individualidentity an identity and a network orjust a network based on locations and soon and so forth and on the other sidewhen the service itself is beingaccessed you can either broadly allow ordeny access to a service or a group ofservices or you can get more granularand say for this service I will onlyallow these methods to be accessed thiswill ensure that truly any access iscontrolled by you irrespect and you canstill have administrative permissionsfor the project handed off to theproject ownerso this allows the security team toprovide this overlay umbrella protectionagainst exfiltrationnow finally before you roll it out wehave what is called a dry run mode inVPC AC which essentially turns on thecontrols but operates in a log only modesoputting a service in dry run mode andwatching traffic flows and violationsover a period of time will allow you todecide what violations are legitimateviolations that you would want to blockand what violations are not legitimatethat could lead to business impact thatyou want to allow by adding anadditional rule so my recommendation iswhenever you create a VPC policy orwhenever you make changes to the policyuse the dry run modegoing back to VPC accessible serviceswe have in many conversations withcustomers the security teams want to bemuch more prescriptivewith in terms of what workloads andresources within a VPC can even accessthat is what vbc accessible servicesdoes because when you create a parameterobviously there is free conversationswithin a parameter and there is if youhave a policy workload within theperimeter can access Services outsidethe perimeter VPC accessible Servicesprovides an additional layer of controland restriction that you can takeadvantage offinally you can move to enforce mode andyou should be protectedlots of interesting questions come herewhen you talk about this how do I decidehow big my perimeter isdo I need to build this Perimeter at anorganization level do I need to buildthis at a at a project level do I haveto combine a bunch of projects togetherthere is no one answer to thiswhat I have seen is customers eitherprimarily they operate in one of threemodels either they have one perimeteracross all their organization and ensurethat all projects whenever they arecreated are part of this parameter theidea here is I am worried about externalthreats that's outside my gcporganization and I want to protect itthen there are customers who have strictpolicies around cross functionalconversations so you know my Devenvironment should not talk to my broadenvironment there we see thismulti-parameter modelgroup of customers who don't want strictrestrictions but want to protect theircritical data sets create smallperimeters around their critical datasets to just protect access to it theseare the three common models seen thereare more in betweenand and around itbut um as you mentioned vpcsc'scapabilities don't stop with the Englishsecret rules within these rules as wellas outside of the rules you can leverageour context of our access capabilitiesto create Access Control based onnon-networknon-identity attributes particularlybased on uh sustaining attributes likesession time or time in general identityIP address and more importantly devicebased attributes like whether an X5online certificate is present on thedevice or not we we require Beyond carbthe Beyond Corp Enterprise product orBeyond car Essentials product to beavailable for you to do thisumso that's my quick overview on vpcscbefore I leave I do want to give you aquick view on what we have and what'scomingvpcsc's roadmap is is robust and I feellike I've talked a lot already but uhthis is interestingumwe decided when we looked at vpcsc thatour roadmap should cover multiplepillars because there is needs acrossmultiple pillars the first one is scaleand as you can see from the numbers herewe have seen vpcsc being used and usedas a default Security Control in a largenumber of customers so we have asksanyway from supporting you know 5000perimeters to 20 000 projects uh in aperimeter so our environment is nowscaled to 40 000 resources ten thousandparameters ten thousand policies and wealso have a way to scale out uh througha capability called scope policiesthe next functionhow specific or granular you can be withyour English secret rules which is howyou allow access into the perimeter youcan Define these rules based on VPCnetworks and what we are announcing inpreview is the ability to use yourprivate IP addresses to extend vpcscnetwork protections and allow forcontrolled access to your gcp servicesfrom on-premise prior to this for any ofyour on-prem resources you just have aLandings on VLAN and that VLAN if it'spart of the perimeter it's free rangefor on-prem you can't you don't need todo that anymoreof course we did work on flexibility aswell which is how you define a perimeterand we extended what you can use todefine parameters to include VPCnetworks toouh finally uh ease of management iscritical delegated Administration thatwe have come up with so that you candistribute management of your perimetersitself in large environments and finallywhat is VPC service controls butprotection for Google services so it isimperative that Google services adoptedfor you to see True Value out of it weare85 I think we are close to 90 coverageas of Q 223 and we have mandated thatany new service coming out of Google'stable will support vpcsc SGAwith the star there that says conditionsare playI think I've spoken enoughI'd like to welcome welcome Christian onstage to talk about his experience withvpcsc and the tenants that he's usingChristian welcomethank you very much SRI for thethank you very much three for the forthe uh introduction of EPC servicecontrols and also on the roadmap on thefeatures next to come presented from uhor provided by Google and now let'sswitch over a little bit to a dialoguewith comments bank so as reset who am II'm Christian guaca head of cyber Centerof Excellence from coax bank andum I want to talk to you a little bitabout comets bank before we areswitching over back to VPC servicecontrols and how we are leveraging VPCservice controlsso first of all whose comments Bankcomments bank is the leading bank forthe general middle stand meaning we'rehaving uh around 26 000 corporateclients and uh roughly 11 Millionsprivate and small business customers sothis is alsoum the reason why we have a clientfocused portfolio we are separate intothese two categories private and smallbusiness customers as well as corporateclientsthen what you see in the in the centerwe have a focused business model uhcomprised of Five Points versus personaladvice we're offering meaning we see thecustomer as the main focus point so wewant to be the personal partner for ourcustomers second consistent customerfocus this means customers demands arechanging and we need to put the keyagain the customer first in order toprovide the right services to thecustomer third comprehensivedigitalization means that we areconstantly evolving to become andprovide better faster and more advancedproducts in a digital portfoliofourth is profitability before growth soFocus totally on the on the on thecustomer demands and last but not leastsustainability which includes bothsustainable products Financial productsas well as helping customers to achievetheir sustainable transformationnow this is comments bank and withincomets bank there's a division key areawhich is called Big Data and advancedanalytics and before I talk to you whatwe are exactly doing there I want togive you some some numbersfirst of all we are roughly 500 peopleuh dispute across four countriesum interesting is that we were the firstbusiness area of Commerce Bank in thepublic cloud and when we work with otherkey areas in the bank we actually get avery good rating from the others someaning what we are doing is probablyquite quite quite good and aninteresting fact that I want to shareespecially with this audience is um wedrive a certain kind of innovation andone point of this Innovation is that weactually contribute towards GoogleCloud's repository code repository so wedid I guess a hat trick last year andthis year again contribute multipletimes to the source code so if you usecontainers on Google cloud or doanything with security on Google Cloudthere's a chance that there's somewheresome part of Commerce Bank running in itand so on a more factual basis what isPDA doing doing big data and advancedanalytics so we are creating value fromdata meaning we are gathering veryhardly speaking the data of the bank andthen we are providing analytics serviceson top of it and offer both as a productor service so for example two use casesone is electronical self-disclosure someaning automated scanning and machinelearning algorithms applied totransaction data and the Second Use caseis what we call press for today so thisis more like looking at the overallGlobal available news and thenconnecting these news with our corporateclientsnow back to me I'm heading as that's acyber center of excellence and ourvision is to force the secure scalableand standardized public Cloud create theinfrastructure and framework to become acloud first business we are responsiblein BDA for data protection informationsecurity and cloud and the importantpart for now of course is informationsecurity and and cloud and within Cloudwe are helping the bank the banks usecases to transition into the cloud toland into the cloud we have engineeringrehab with the architecturewe also do product development which wecall the cloud Enterprise Suite becausewe can make the cloud very secure butour goal is not only to make the closein queue but also trustworthyand last but not least we are also doingknowledge sharing we call it E equals MCsquared so this means excitementequals multiplication of knowledge timesculture times curiosity because you knowwe don't only want to talk about Cloudwe also want everyone we are talking toto also experience cloud and to learnwhy Cloud would help them to achievetheir benefit their business goalsokay now we have learned about Commercebank and now back to VPC servicecontrollersbefore we introduce service controls onour roadmap there too we actually hadfive questions and I want to explain toyou how we answer these five questionsum the first question that I want toshow to you is when bringingorganizations and applications to thecloud which threat threat vectorsshifted with a high impactand actually if you look at it and youmove to the cloud one thing that changesdrastically is the model of the sharedresponsibility or shared fate meaningthe services the customer is taking careof is by it reduced to actually the dataand the applications of the cloudservice customer and the cloud serviceprovider is taking care of let's say thedata center of the cables and of thelower level management and you can shiftthis up to a maximum where the customeris only dealing with applications dataand maybe it's processes so this meansthe threat landscape moves completely todata and applicationssecond pointthe data transmission is completelyhandled differently than on-prem so ifyou compare what you most likely knowfrom on-prem is imagine you have a houseand in this house you have a lot ofroomsif you want to go from one room toanother room or from one room and onehouse to another room in another houseyou need a lot of keys you need to knowwhere to gonow if you compare this to cloud cloudis completely different Cloud works likethis room here it's a large room andactually everyone can talk to anyone Ijust need to ask you hey can I talk toyou is a user yes or no and that's itand no one else is stopping me so thequestion is now okay data transmissionyou have to think about how do we securethis how does data movement actually iscontrolled and so this is an inherentquestion we need to ask and we need toresolve and resolve result was that weactually as I've seen a 10 timesincrease of importance of IIM controlsand but IM controls isn't enough becauseyou can control I am but can you controlwhere your data flows do you want tocontrol that your data or do we want tosee your data moving anywhere of coursenotso this boils down to data exfiltrationprevention where data exfiltration meansyour data is moving from your assets toexternal assets and lateral datamovement means that your data isuncontrolled flowing within yourorganization and actually we don't wantany of thatno knowing this second question was whatare your main security requirements Whenselecting a cloud serviceso now we have learned okay um which howdid the threat model change but how dowe select now the right services onGoogle Cloudwhere we build a model for that and wefirst start with the securityfoundationsand as we are strongly regulated companyin Germany in Europe underlying multipleregulations local regulations in-houseregulations Europe regulations there's alot coming together telling us what todo and especially what not to doand these are external drivers we alsohave internal drivers which come fromdifferent setups from organizationrequirements which again Define theinternal standards on security and if wetake both together you actually get usoutput the system security requirementsand system hereas the Google cloud and now we know wehave security guidelines we havesecurity measurements and now we need toknow how to steer the Google Cloudbut this is very generic how do you mapit like a very generic model to specificthings like let's say Google CloudStorage or VPC service controls there isno mapping and so we built a mapping wecall it the cloud service securityassessment and so for each service thatthe cloud Google cloud is offering weactually evaluate evaluating a series ofsecurity features for example we want tosee if the data can be encrypted withour key customer management encryptionKeys We want to make sure that the datastays in Europe so we need to have a Georecognization applied to itwe want to see that the services thatGoogle is offering to for us actuallycertified in the sense that there's acertification from ISO 27001 or psic5 orother equivalent standardsand after that as an outcome we get thismetrics that you see here on the on thebottom right part of the of the slide sothat your lines are your services andyour columns are all the the thesecurity requirements that we applyand then on the right hand bottom sideas an outcome you get the cloud servicesecure configuration so for each servicethat was slow whitelisted we also needto Define how to use the service justbecause you know cloud storage is securedoesn't mean that everyone knows how touse cloud storage securely yeah becauseI can trust create a cloud storage andcloud storage supports customermanagement encryption keys but thisdoesn't mean that every bucket that Icreate will immediately have a cloudmanaged encryption key so that's whywe need bothnow next question how do we protect ourCloud Google Cloud workloads againstdata exfiltration threads so we havelearned about data exploration and wehave learned about the Google cloudservices Nexus how do we protect themand first let me share with you a veryinteresting fact so if you moveto Cloudand you use a lot of Google Cloud nativeservices like cloud storage bigquery Pubsub you name it it's a one thing youwill you will encounter is the more youuse stuff on Google Cloud the less youwill deal with IP addresses or yourthere are the IP stuff will come intransparent for you it just it'shappened magically by Google in thebackgroundand we did a survey on on all of thevideo Cloud resources on the cloudactually over your 90 of all ourservices that we are using across alluse casesum leverage API communicatecommunication only so meaning that no IPaddress is used and as a resultis that all the traditional andclassical security that we have builtover the years for managing IP addressessecuring HP address suddenly doesn'tapply anymoreso meaning we have two results the firstone is all the firewalls as we mentionedthe firewalls are still important forthe other 10 but for the 90 we cannotapply itand for this 90 we need a new model anew thread model how to think about howcan we secure our workloads on GoogleCloudand now I I talked a lot about how tosecure it but what are we exactlysecuring again so I talked about dataexfiltration and this slide shouldn'tscare you but I want to show you how youcan access trade data from yourorganization like within secondsso the first step what you need to doyou need to have an employee who canread some data so here's part of yourorganization and he's part of the goodproject of the green project and he getsRich access to data this is totallyusual this is part of every organizationbecause otherwise you can process thedata but now what is happening in thesecond stepthis same employee in his free time backat home just creates another GoogleCloud project no one is going to stophimand well on this projectwhat he's doing in this is just I meanhe's the owner of the project obviouslywhen he's created it but he is rightpermissions on the evil project outsidethe organization on the left hand sideyes read permissions and all he's doingis just using Chia Studio copy leftbucket right bucket and that's itso three easy steps to exfiltrate thedata and this is not what we want tohave we need a tool in order to makesure that we control how the data isflowed how the data flows and this is ofcourse where we come to PPC servicecontrolsand here I've listed some reasons why wewent for VPC service controls so you canI mean to to name one one term how youcan imagine which service controls it'slike a like a zero trust API firewall itis much more than that but um maybe it'seasy to to imagine something like thisyou have organization administrators whoare responsible for making sure thatthis setup is only controlled by theorganization admins it's not undercontrol by the use cases it is based onidentities and servicesand it is cut into parameters limitedBridges and access levels parameters youcan imagine like is one project is oneparameter and with all the settings youcan access you cannot access as part ofa parameter if two use cases want tospeak to each other you need a parameterBridgeand the functional properties actuallyare well now suddenly we can control ouraccess to the Google apisbecause we have this parameter boundaryaround the services around identitiesaround projectsand so we have a very fine Crest finegrained access model for all our datafor all our assets and yeah the onlything uh left on the list which isimportant to think about is that it'snon-transitive what does this mean thismeans if I grant three access to mybuckets and three grants access to someof his friends access to his bucket hisfriends don't have access to my bucketso I need everyone who needs access tomy bucket needs to explicitly ask meso this thenin the end leads to the vpcsc standardarchitecture that we have establishedand it consists actually four elementsfor easy to understand elements thefirst one is so and these elements eachelement of this talks about datatransfer when I'm talking about datatransfer I of course mean controlleddata transferthe first one is we want to make surethat no data leaves comets Banksenvironmentthe second point is we want to make surethat no one from outside of commentsBank can access the data inside ofcommands Bank these are maybe theobvious onesbut now even inside of comets Bank wewant to make sure that use case onecannot share data with use case bwithout permission so there's no nobleeding no overlap between the usecasesand the third thing or here on the slidefourth thing is you even want to controlthe data flow between stages within asingle use cases so as an example wehave a developer and the developer is avery good developers the best developerwe have in Commerce Bank and this isdeveloping a new cool business productin depth and is that well I need I needproductive data in order to see that mytool is workingand if you don't have a VPC standardactual standard architecture in placethis developer in depth will have accessto production workloads because he canjust you know copy it as I said just asone one commandso we need to make sure this is thisdeveloper gets of course its own desktest data but on the other hand but it'sstill more important does not haveaccess to productive dataand so the vpcsc standard architecturegreatly reduce the thread surface andestablish automated control this isfully automated it is zero trustarchitectureand we have validated multiple timeswith several Security Experts as well asfrom also from Google and as far as Iknow the best of my knowledge we werethe First Financial Institute rollingout the security architecture back in2020.so you can say why are we using VPservice controls using for three reasonsone is as a data acceleration amitigation second is to control the dataflow the data sharing and third is tobuild environmentsnext question given your VPC servicecontrol standard that you have seenright now how do you monitor violationsinternal usage of the standardthis is actually quite easy we have twodashboardsthe dashboard on the left with LucasStudio we are monitoring the VPC as theeffectiveness so we see how manyviolations we have which kind ofviolations against which servicesagainst which projects from whichcountry and then we are evaluating thistogether with our zoc teamon the right hand side you see actuallywith everything Cloud monitoring we aremonitoring the vpcsc limits in quartersso when when here we see how manyparameters we have on on Google cloudand the more red you see here the more Iwill call series number and tell themhey please scale moreand so this is how we make sure on theleft hand side that the service isworking correctly we can drag it and onthe right hand side we see how much wegrow into into Google Cloudand this brings me to my last questionwhich may be the most important one forfor you as the audience here how canother Google Cloud customers achieve thesame high level of data exfiltrationmitigation as we doand of course there's no one fits allanswer but first thing that you need todo is you need to build a visionso what are you trying to achieve do youwant to have Cloud for cloud do you doyou use the cloud actually for cloudworkloads or do you use the cloud foron-prem workloads how do you secure yourdata workflow to implement zero trustand if you have when you haveestablished this Vision the next step iswhat do you need to actually bring thisVision to life do you need Executivesponsoring do you need Security Expertsdo you need Cloud expertswho do you need to involve in generaland after you have placed divisionadmission the next goes towards processand technology so the question is howmuch have you matured into the cloudalready how many of your workloads areCloud native which workloads do you needto secureand how do you embed the VPC servicecontrol into your organization do youhave probably a lot of projects a lot ofservices how do you make sure that allof these are covered by the by thesecurity standardsand last but not least but often themost important part is the peopleso how do we make sure that that isclear who owns the standardization so Ijust showed you our standardization howdo you make sure it is correctlyimplemented how do you make sure there'san owner who drives the standard how doyou control the monitoringand last but not least how do you shareknowledge how do you make sure that thisdoesn't feel as a burden to theorganization but this field actuallyactually as an enabler for a companyand after you have answered thesequestions then it's on YouTube of courseimplement it and hopefully have a moresecure security posture on Google cloudsthis brings me to the end of theCommerce Bank part for VPC servicecontrols and thank you for yourattention I will now head over back tothreeforeign"
