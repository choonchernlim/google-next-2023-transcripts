seen be heard and be relevantthis is the CEO and founder of rise upfor you her name is Natalina nasserdineshe has been seen on Amazon Bloomberg TVeven been in Times Square she's giventwo tedx talks and she's written anumber one best-selling book on Amazonrise up for you please give a huge roundof applause to our next speaker Natalinanaserdinehello check check can you hear me checkcheck you can already tell what kind ofroom it's going to be right awesome Ilove that well as you heard I'm the CEOand founder of Rise it for you but Ididn't always start that way so Iactually started as a performer I usedto tour the world internationally as asinger and a dancer does anyone like tosing or dancenot one person in this room okay I gotone move I love that and interestinglyenough every time I walked into a roomthere were hundreds of performers Ialways got the center stage spot now ifyou know anything about performing andsinging you know that Center Stage isthe place that you want to be theycalled the diva Spotlight right but Iwas never ever the best singer meaningthat there were a number of people thatwere in the room that had much moretechnical skill than I had okay four tofive six singers that were way moreadvanced technically and yet I alwaysgot the center stage spot so they usedto come up to me and they used to sayokay Netta how do I stand where youstand and I used to say you know it'sinteresting because your parents aremusicians you have parents that arecelebrities you have a three and a halfoctave range I have a two and a halfoctave range and yet I get that CenterStage spotsimply because when I walk into a room Iwalked into a room with ownership Iwalked into a room and I talked to thedirector I walked into the room and Irecognized at a younger age that ifthere's 500 people in this room that allsing and dance the same way how am Igoing to be seen be heard and berelevant okay now fast forwarded abouteight years and I become the executiveof An Education Corporation 27 years oldI have 200 team members under meindividuals that had phds master'sdegrees Bachelors all the certificationsyou can think of and yet they were stillconstantly getting in their own way ofgrowing in their career of communicatingof leading of optimizing their potentialnow obviously as an executive if some ofyou are anyone an executive or leader inthis roomokay anyone a business ownerokay so you can imagine as an executivethat can be frustrating that you haveall this amazing talent technically allthe right degrees and yet they're notpushing their potential and it's notonly impacting them as a personalprofessional but it's also impacting theorganizational growth and now today ofcourse I I run the company rise it foryou as you heard and we're working withorganizations and individuals around theworld we're in over 50 countries and wesee the exact same thing happening andat the end of the day professionals andleaders they all ask the same questionin a world where we can take two resumesand put them next to each otherindividuals have the same degree thesame experience how come one person goesfurther and fasterin a world that we can have a multitudeof companies that all do the same thingwe all know that the space is veryinundated no matter what industry you'rein how come one company that does thesame thing as you goes further andfaster and at the end of the day peoplewant to know how can I be seenhow can I be heard and how can I berelevantso we're going to jump in I'm going toshare with you three strategies todaythis is going to be interactive I'm notgoing to talk at you for 45 minuteswe're going to do some exercises we'regoing to have some conversation and I'meven going to open it up for a littlebit of q a at the end because I reallybelieve in the power of you askingcustomizable questions okay step numberone I always say be the billboard thatpeople stop to see step number one isthe easiest point I'm going to give youtodayit's something that you can Implementright now when you walk out of here okaythere are way too many professionals itdoesn't matter what industry you're inthat walk into a room as if they don'texistthere are way too many professionalsthat forget that individual contributionhelps escalate and grow organizationalcontribution now I stood in the backsome of you were walking and you mighthave seen me I do that on purpose I dothat to observe the individuals thatwalk into a room how do they walk into aroom how do they carry themselves dothey go straight to their seat do theynetwork with the person next to them dothey have conversation or do they walkin as if they don't exist because theydon't want to be seen But at the end ofthe day they do want to be seenand I see this every single time I walkinto a room and I speak and we work withour different organizations every singletimewhich color do we see in the room todayin clothingnot very much right bright colors okayso one simple step to being seen andstanding out is to wear a bright colorfor example the yellow that I'm wearingI see yellow in the third row she's likedon't call me out okay I see yellow inthe very very back but that's an instanteye catcher why because in a room that'sfull of black and brown and navy andwhite color instantly attracts the eyeand it's also a conversation starter nowdo you know how many individuals in thelast day and today if you see me saw meyesterday you know what I'm talkingabout I had like bright orange onwhatever do you know how many peoplecame up to me that I didn't know thatsaid I love your outfit I love yourshoes and then we start to have aconversation what do you do where areyou from let's exchange cards and nowwe're building connections right we'rebeing seento tell you the truth I love the colorblack my whole wardrobe is black but Irealized that when I started to run abusiness and when I was a performer Iunderstood that I needed to be thebillboard which means that visually Ineeded to catch the audience's eye orthe director's eye these are smallsimple things that you can do even in aremote world even if it makes you alittle bit uncomfortable I think okaycan I have one shirt that's pink oneshirt that's green one shirt that's bluewhatever it is because remember thatcolors also emulate energy and emotionand we all carry that okay consciouswith your colors and brandrepresentation so let's talk a littlebit about energywe're still on being seenenergy is incredibly important in everysingle person in this room carries anenergyokay you're passing your energy to theperson next to you and the person nextto you is passing the energy back to youright it's going back and forth when Iwas an executive I thought I was thebest leader ever200 team members under me as I told youI thought I was amazing I'm like 27years old I'm an awesome executive I hadan open door policy not one team memberwould come in the room and talk to me nothat oneso then one team member said well you'rekind of intimidatingand I said no I don't think that's trueand then another team member said wellyou're kind of intimidating and I saidnope that's not true at allbut I wanted to learn and I wanted togrow as a leader so I decided to do ananonymous survey and I asked 200 teammembers about my leadership as anexecutive I was the only executive thatdid it everybody else said no we're notdoing thatout of 200 people75 of the team said I was intimidatingnot relatable and I looked mad all thetimethat was a rough night for mebut I was thankful for the feedbackbecause I realized that my energy what Iwanted to show and what I was feeling inthe inside wasn't actually the energythat was being received you see myself-assessment was not accurateaccording to business Harbor review95 of leaders think they have accurateself-assessment only 10 percent actuallydoI was one of the 95 that thought I hadaccurate self-assessment in the inside Ifelt warm and fuzzy and I wantedeveryone to talk to me but on theoutside they got a very differentperception of who I was so I needed toshift that energy so that my leadershipand my energy can actually emulate whatit is that I truly wanted to feelokay so we have fostering and openenergy what kind of energy do you wantto promote has anyone ever heard of thatresting faceyeah okay being conscious of our faceand our facial expressions okay avoidsubservient languageso that'sum uh like you know uh all the differentpauses that we have when we speakbecause sometimes we get uncomfortablewith pauses in space when we speak andthen lastly we're going to talk aboutthis are your valuesso if I were to ask you right now whatare your top three values that you wantto emulate and that you want to projectwithout opening your mouth what wouldthey bewhat would be the top three valuesso one of my values is when I walk intoa room of course I want to project theenergy of confidenceand hopefully that's what's beingprojectedokay that's for sure a top value for meanother value is kindnessright and and understanding that everysingle person in the room mattersdoesn't matter what your job is what youdo who you are and I want to create anenergy that I'm open to everyone I don'tcare who you are what you do rightthat's a value of mine and I hope thatwhen I walk into a room that's what I'mprojecting within the tenth of a secondsomeone is making a judgment about whoyou are before you even open your mouthbefore you even open your mouth when youwalk into a job interview when you walkinto a networking event when you walkinto a conference and if you're tryingto grow in your career if you're tryingto get stakeholders to support youinvestors if you're trying to run a teamall these little nuances matterso I want you to take just a minute andI want you to think what are your topthree values that you hope to projectand emulate as a professional top threeI want you to think about itokay then I want you to ask yourselfif you were to tell me your top threevalues and I went to five people thatyou knew really well would they say thatthose are the top things that youprojector would they say something differentso I want you to write down what are mytop three values that I hope to projectbefore I even open my mouthand then later on todayI want you to text five people that youtrust to give you positive and honestfeedback and say what are the top threevalues and energy I project when I walkinto a roomand let's see how much is in alignmentokay that's an exercise so that's beseennow let's talk about being heardshowing self-confidencemy team and I every year we askthousands of professionals not hundredsthousands of professionalswhat their number one challenges83 say self-confidence83 percent83 percentmy team and I as Lauren mentioned we'redownstairs in the inclusion Lounge we'redoing coaching for free for the nextthree days guess what the number onething is when people come in the roomself-confidenceand posture syndrome perfectionistmindset not feeling enoughright even though you've achievedsuccess you get there and you're like Istill don't feel successful83 percentnow back in the day I was a collegeinstructor and I asked the collegefreshman the same question when theywould come in to school I would ask themabout their self-confidence 80 percentsaid they were less worthy than othersand 85 percent said they didn't believein their abilitieswhere do you think that comes fromthat comes from the 83 percent ofprofessionals that are in the workplacetoday that are parents of the kids thatare in the collegeyou see if we don't break that cycle itkeeps repeating and repeating andrepeating and repeating some of you havechildren that are what we call you knowthe igen generation right that are inthe technology space some of you havechildren that are 27 26 25 that fallinto that percentagesome of you are 27 and 28 that fall intothat percentage of not feeling enough nomatter what you doand I can guarantee that the majority ofthis room 83 percent are struggling withconfidence or confidence factor and Ialways say that self-confidence impactsYour Capacity to communicatesay that again self-confidence impactsYour Capacity to communicateand to be the leader that you're meantto beand to create Clarity in your expressionnow it's not your faultokay because our whole entire lifewe have been taught and by the way thisis global right because we do this workall over the world our whole life we'vebeen taught to build what I call Microlevel confidence okay and I talk aboutthis in my bookmicro level confidence is that we havebeen taught to build confidence in acategory of Competency or a thing okaythink about it you go to school K-12 yougo to university you go get acertificate whatever it is you get goodgrades in this right you get an A inthis subject your whole life that's whatyou're taught that's part of the systemright and then you get older some of usgo to university we get degrees and thenwe get good grades and a GPA in acertain subject a certain topic this iswhat we call Micro level confidence soyou might be confident in coding rightI'm confident as a speaker you might beconfident in selling whatever it isyou're competent in a thing you'reconfident in a thing that's what we callMicro level confidence the problem withmicro level confidence especially in theworld with artificial intelligence whichI think is amazing but we have to learnhow to balance it is it the world isconstantly changing and all this microlevel confidence exists outside of youand anything that exists outside of youinevitably can and will changeso this is what we saw during covetindividuals from around the world wereconfident in their career in their jobtitle and their skill in their businessand everything overnight changed andguess what else changed they came to usand they saidwho am Iwhat's my identitywhat's my self-worthmy whole entire life I thought I wasthis and this is how I defined my worthand my value in the worldand it all fell apart and so did theythat's a dangerous game in a world thatis constantly changing and constantlyshiftingthink about it with artificialintelligence and 10 years from now halfof our degrees and skills aren't goingto matter we need to adapt we need toPivot And if every time we need tochange our skill our confidence goes allthe way back down to the bottomthat's going to be very difficult thatcycle to do it over and over and overagainwhat we really want to build is what Icall a macro level confidence which is abelief in your ability to learnwhich is a belief in your ability togrow which is an understanding thatfailure is research to success thinkabout scientists they spend their wholelife failing if they're lucky maybethey'll find one solution in theirlifetime of being a scientistbut they don't consider themselves afailure they consider that this wholetime they're building research to findthe right solution to solve the problemimagine if as human beings we thoughtthe exact same waymacro level confidence is realizing thatperfectionism prevents you from yourpotential you don't have to raise yourhand but how many of you have this thingthat you want to do or this project thatyou want to submit or maybe a startupthat you want to do or an action thatyou want to take and you keep waitingfor it to be perfect and then one yeargoes bytwo years go bythree years go by and before you know itfive ten years have gone by and you'relike it's still not perfectand the Whole Decade has passed you upso macro level confidence isunderstanding that you are an evolvinghuman being and that you haveself-compassion towards your mistakesbecause you're not a robot you're notartificial intelligence yeah if we mightbe in the future I don't knowokayso here's what I want to doI always say the sky is not the limitit's the mind we're going to do a littleexercise togetheryou're going to scan this QR code or youcan do it on your paper if you like toyou know draw the circle it's up to youhow you want to do it we're going torate our confidence together okay andI'm going to break it down for you nowwe're going to do this withself-compassion meaning I don't carewhat your score is todayit's not about what your score is todayit's about where we can get in the nexttwo to three months okay with some ofthe strategies that I'm going to providefor youso I want you to scan the QR code andI'm going to break down this circle foryou these are the six pillars ofbuilding self-confidence okaypillar number one is self-talk so that'sthe narrative that's in your mindis it positiveor is it negativeare you your number one cheerleader orare you your number one criticare you constantly managing yourthoughts so that they can serve youor are you listening to your thoughts somuch that they sabotage youone through ten ten being amazingone being danger zone and theneverything else in betweenokay pillar number twois trusting your intuition you know thatthing that's in that that feeling inyour stomachthat says Ah I should do this or thatdoesn't feel righthow many times do you sayum I'm just gonna ignore itordo you say you know what I think I needto listen to thatone through ten ten being amazingone danger zonenumber three taking riskand I don't mean jumping out of anairplaneI mean taking risk that makes sense foryou on a daily basis it could be havingan uncomfortable conversationright it could be walking into a roomwith Executives and leaders andexpressing yourself so that you can getto the outcome that you need to get toit could be having uncomfortableconversations with stakeholders thoseare all risky things that feel reallyuncomfortablerightso one through tenI just had this the other day actuallywe have a new client a big client acompany and we did a training about aweek and a half agoand in the training you know we'reteaching emotional intelligence andwe're cultivating a space of you knowpsychological safety so that people cantalk about emotional intelligence andmove some through some things asexecutiveswell one of the executives reprimandedanother executive in the training thatI'm in while they were in a moment ofvulnerabilityokay so that executive is the highestperson in the company I'm not going tosay something right there because itwould be inappropriate andunprofessionalbut I had to have a conversation withmyself and say they're a really bigclient but out of Integrity I think it'simportant for me to provide the feedbackthat that psychological safety wasbroken in that training and that's alittle bit scary because what if theydon't like the feedback and then what ifthey decide that they don't want to workwith us anymore right that's all thestuff that's going on in my headbut I decided to take the riskand I saidprivately I said I'd love to have aquick phone call with you we had a phonecall and I profession professionallyexpressed here's what I observed here'smy recommendation you don't have to takeit if you don't want to but I know wewant to create a place an environment ofgrowth and this is what I observed andhere's how I think we can solve ityou know what he said to methank you for being honest thank you foryour transparency and I'm going to solveit okay awesomebut I was scared that was a riskokay now we go on to number four thatself-promotion a lot of individualsstruggle with this pillar self-promotionbeing able to stand in youraccomplishments being able to stand inyour successbeing able to receive compliments andtake them and say thank you so muchbeing able to walk into an organizationand say Here's the growth here are theresults and here are the outcomes I haveachieved in the last two yearsand understanding your value and whatyou bring to the table some of youraised your hand that your businessowners and your entrepreneurs I have totell you when I first started mybusiness that was the key to get outthere because no one's going to pushyour business no one's going to pushyour brand even in your in your careerno one's going to do that except for youyou have to be willing to talk aboutyourself and the accomplishments and thevalues that you bring to the table a lotof times we wait for people to call usout and to validate us and to say you'reamazing but you have to realize it in acompany of thousands that you're amazingit's not really gonna happenyou have to be the one to step forwardand say here's what I brought to thetableand I want to shine a line on it becauseI want to grow in my career or I want totake this path whatever Direction it isthat you want to go into one through tenthe next one that's a tough one toosetting healthy boundariesbeing able to say thank you so much forthinking of me right now I'm completelyat capacity can you call me next timeI'd love to help but in this currentmoment I have to say nookay I have to say noremember that you can't give what youdon't haveso if you have an empty bucket you'renot serving anybody because what you'redoing is only producing maybe 30 percentof your potential on a project versusgiving it a hundred percent and I knowthat there's different Industries andthere's different climates that can bevery high stress and so sometimesthere's a lot coming at you but if youcan create healthy boundaries in theareas that you have full control over orthat you can take back ownership overthat's going to create more capacity forbe the for you to be the best that youcan beyou know we tell this to our clients allthe time we're constantly on stage we'reconstantly coaching and training it's ahigh energy high impact industry thatwe're in because we're always in thespotlight so we have very strongboundaries within our company of when westart work when we end you know we don'tdo things on the weekend unless ofcourse we get hire to do somethingamazing and we only do that not becausewe want to say no but because if we takeon and we take on and we pick up thephone at 1am and we're answering emailstill 2 A.M then when I get on stage foryou today I'm going to be stumbling overmy words I'm not going to have theenergy and the capacity to give youeverything that I have and then that'snot fair to youand lastly growth mindset do you believein your ability to learndo you live in the I can't period or doyou live in the I can't comma butI'll figure it outbut I'll learn it if you give me alittle bit of timebut if you give me some resources I canmake it happenI always tell this story and he doesn'tlike it but I'm going to tell it anywayof a family memberwhen he was 21 years oldno college degreehe got a phone callfrom a movie studio a big movie studiocalled Paramount some of you might knowitand they came to him and they said theycalled him and they said we heard youwere a really amazing workerand he said I'm21 years old I don't have a degree I'veworked but how did you hear about mewell we just heard you were a greatworkershe's like okayso he goes to the interviewand there's professionals that have beenin the industry for 10 20 30 years 40 5060 years old he's 21.he applies for the joband the individual at the time sayswhy should I hire you you have noexperience you have no degrees like youdon't know anything about this industrygrowth mindset and confidence he saidyou're right I have no experience Idon't know anything about this industrybut here's what I can tell you I'll workreally really hard I believe in myability to grow anything you give to meI'm going to make it work and I'm goingto learn it and I'm going to accelerateI'm going to do whatever I got to do tomake it work and have great success herewell guess what he got the joband he was there for over a decadesimply because he believed in hisability to learnand he displayed his confidence and heclearly self-promotedright he self-promoted his strengthsso I know I say all this and you'reprobably thinking yeah but how do I growmy confidence so we're going to do aquick exercise okay it's not on thisPowerPoint I'm improving in the momentFour B's to believing and betting in youokay for B's B number one what is thebelief just put down one right now onelimiting belief that you believe isgetting in the way of your success itcould be that's getting in the way ofyour success as an entrepreneur as abusiness owner as a leader as aprofessional whatever it is what's onelimiting belief that you think you haveright now that's getting in the way foryou okay just I want you to think of onebeliefnow I want to be very very clear thatself-doubt and these beliefs that wehavemost of them are negative for everybodyeven for me and I do this on a dailybasis so it's not about completelygetting rid of self-doubt that doesn'texistI would be untruthful to you if I toldyou let's crush self-doubt it doesn'treally happenit's about managing the self-doubt andmanaging the beliefs so that it servesyou versus sabotages youokay big differenceso what's one limiting belief write itdown be number two is the back storywhat's the back story of that belief howmany of us of us have children or were achild at one pointall of usthink about childrenwhen they're born they Bounce Off theWall they do what they want they saywhatever they want has anyone ever met ababy that tried to learn how to crawland then they fell and they fell andthey fell and then they looked at youand they said nope just not going towalk for the rest of my lifewe've never seen that right babies thatget back up and they keep trying andthey keep trying and they keep tryingeven when they fall it's not until theyget a little bit olderthat people teachers Society romanticPartners whatever it is they say no noyou can't do thatnopeor they say no you're not good enoughfor thator they say yeah I cannot consider youat all you're not a good fit it's notuntil we get older that all that stuffstarts to come into our belief systemand then before you know it you're 20you're 30 you're 40 you're 50 years oldand now you're professional in theworkplace you're trying to evolve you'retrying to grow and all those beliefsfrom the last 20 30 or 40 and 50 yearsare impacting your ability to moveforwardso I want you to ask yourself what's theback story of the belief that you wrotedownit could be I remember very clearly myformer leader they said this to me itmade me feel a certain way now I'm at anew job and all I can do is hear thatformer leader in my head telling me thatI'm not good enoughit's possibleI see some of you reacted to that whichmeans that could be your storyOkay the third B is the most importantand that is the behavior so so far we'vehad what's the belief what's the backstory of the beliefand being number three is what's thebehavior that it's causing in you yousee all of our beliefs they createbehaviorsI've been doing this for a long time soI can tell about somebody's beliefsystem just by the way they behavethe way they walk into a room the waythey shake my hand the way that theyconverse with other individuals I cantell what their belief system is becauseyour behaviors are representative ofyour thoughtsso I want you to ask yourself what's thebehavior that it's causing in you thatyou want to shiftit could be the behavior is that whenI'm in meetings I don't raise my handand speak up even though I havesomething really important to sayit could be that I become overlyassertive when I don't need to because Ifeel like I need to have my voice heardso I want you to ask yourself what isthat behaviorI remember when I was when I was youngerwhen I was a leaderwhen I would be up in front leading myteamsometimes they would raise their handand they would say why do we have to dothatnow I was a different person 10 yearsagoso in the moment I would say because Isaid so I'm the boss and I told youthat's what we're gonna do that's thebehavior that I hadbut then I started to ask myself I don'treally like that behavior that's notgreat leadershipso I started to ask myself why am Ibehaving that wayand I realized that in my head I had thebeliefare they trying to negate me are theyasking me questions to make me look badbecause I'm 27 and I'm young and I'm theyoungest one in this company are theyjust trying to put me on the spotthere's all the things that were in myhead that no one ever said to me I justcreated themand because I had these beliefs Icreated a behavior as a leader thatwasn't a great Behavior and the second Iwas able to build that self-awareness tobreak it down in my self-confidence Iwas able to show up differently so thenthe next time they asked a question Isaid that's a really great question letme break it down for you and then if youhave any more questions come see melatershifted the behavior because I got tothe beliefokayI know I'm wearing you know yellow heelsand a yellow jacket and it sounds likesuper easybut I'm gonna share a story with you I'mgonna get a little bit vulnerablebecause that's my style five years agothis company didn't existfive years ago I was an executive Ididn't know anything about trainingcoaching Consulting I didn't even knowwho Tony Robbins wasfive years ago both of my parents passedaway by the time I was 30 years old 31years oldand I lost everything as an executivehelping my parents trying to survivethrough different sicknesses so when Iwas 31 I had 100 in my account no job nocar two luggage and both of my parentspassed awaybecause I had the macro level confidencebecause my parents gave it to me whichis I wasn't defined by my executive roleI wasn't defined by the money in thecushy six figures in the house I wasn'tdefined by that because they taught meto have that macro confidenceI was able to build something even whenI was at the very very bottommy mother would be in the hospital Iwould run across the street to 24 HourFitness take showers I would come backto the hospital open up the laptop howdo you build a businesswhat's a podcast who's Tony RobbinsI don't have a business degree my degreeis in executive leadershipbut because that macro confidenceexisted I was able to build more microlevel confidenceand I share that story with you becausesometimes you see a
