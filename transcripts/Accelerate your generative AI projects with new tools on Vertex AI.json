to have you hereI'm JasonI manage several of our AI projects hereat Google cloud and I'm here with Eriche's the vice president of data scienceat Estee Lauderwe've got a packed agenda for today'ssessionwe're going to start with an overview ofvertex and where it fits into our suiteof productsincluding all of our newly releasedgenerative AI capabilitiesthen Eric will tell you about how EsteeLauder works with vertex to deliver AIenable solutions for businessstakeholderswell come back to me for some Demos in adeeper dive into some of our mostexciting new products including vertex'smodel Gardenwe'll talk about how it's a startingpoint for your AI Journeysand then we'll save some time for Q a atthe endlet's get right into itso Google Cloud provides customers witha complete set of capabilities andsolutions this is a diagram of ourtechnology stackif you look starting at the bottomwe have some of the world's best andmost differentiated infrastructureincluding our GPU which has a verycompelling price performance ratiowe also run GPU as many of you saw fromthe from the keynote that just finishedwith uh with Nvidia as wellone step up and we'll come back to thisin a lot more detail is our model Gardenwhere we offer open source Google firstparty and third-party modelsthis is the starting point for your AIJourneys it contains a curated set ofmany of the models we use for Solutionsup the stack as wellthis year we've extended thecapabilities of our AI platformwhich has traditionally been known asvertexfor training and hosting models we nowhavetuning distilling evaluating your modelswe also have extensions and connectorsand then we'll come back to this as wellfor for a brief second around groundinglater ona lot of these are new announcementsthis week and I encourage you to jointhe breakout sessions that are going todive into each of these in detailas we move further upwe have capabilities for search andconversational AIsome of our agents so our AI Solutionsprovide Solutions out of the box forthings like document understandingFinancial Risk tooling like andanti-money laundering toolingand also conversational interactionswe've integrated responsible AI toolingup and down the stack as well so eachone of these products come with built-inresponsible AI toolingand we're also proud to work with ourpartners to deliver Solutions across ourentire ecosystemI'd love to introduce Eric to come talkabout Estee lauder's Journeyit's the wrong direction great start ohall right hello everyone my name is EricHiggins and I'm here to talk about sorryI'm here to out here to talk about howthe Estee Lauder Companies is usingGoogle cloud in order to Delight itsconsumers in the um and the the luxuryBeauty space[Music]now most of you did a bit of a businessperspective wellprobably familiar uh with Estee Lauderbut many of you are probably notfamiliar with all the brands that areunder the Estee Lauder umbrellaum so here's a little list of them herethe srl companies are a collection ofbrands that span Cosmetics fragranceskin and health hair care and these allof these brands have a unique valueproposition and voice each has a each isdistinct in their own way and thatdistinction is essential to the luxuryexperience that each one of these BrandsdeliversnowOur Brands don't exist in a vacuum andmuch like the companies that y'allrepresentum we Face Fierce competition in themarketplace many of the challenges uhthat are many of the challenge that weFace are on the grounds of theexperiences that we drive with ourconsumers things like client tellingonline and digital digital experiencesomnichannel convenience and of coursekeeping up with um the ever-changingtrends in the beauty industry as well asthe fashion industrysuccess on these fronts meansdemonstrating Excellence not only incommercial activities but in operationsefficiency but also in the creativedisciplines through which we express andestablish our brand identity so prettysimple stuff overallnowthe essay a lot of companies has a setof guiding principles which actuallyconnect pretty well to the establishmentof a data science organization and uhyou know these I think translate wellboth in terms of the goals that we aretrying to achieve as well as theresponsible development of the practicesthat we're trying to driveit's under these circumstances that thea new data science team was formed in2021 about the same time that vertex AIwas getting launched so we were kind ofco-evolving along with vertex AI this iswhen I joined the company and I joinedto start a new data science team and theequally new digital technology andexperience group at Estee Lauder theteam was to have a global remit acrossall brands andacross all brands with a mission todeliverresults-oriented data science andanalytics Solutionsdemanded among other things flexibilityall of these diverse Brands operated indiverse regions around the world andthey assumed equally diverse technicalapproaches so flexibility was sort ofnecessary in order to make sure that ourSolutions were generalizableforeignfortunately we were given theopportunity to actually build a new datascience platform from the ground up anddoubly fortunately we were able to havean exceptionally talented machinelearning leader join our team by thename of Chris curro who actually had theforesight to reinforce a system of aculture of devops discipline throughouteverything that we did and he was ableto maintain this from the very beginninguntil now and I cannot overstate theimportance of this devops discipline indeveloping machine learningopportunities and how much has been ableto drive what we're doing and how muchof that was actually enabled by VortexAi and Google Cloud toolsso this is the the part of thedevelopment philosophy that Chris helpedus reinforceum actually in the interest of time I'mnot going to read the whole thing butthis is important because this actuallyguides all of our developments and it isactually empowered by all of theservices that we're able to draw fromGoogle Cloud it has allowed us to adhereto these principles and develop in a waythat was ultimately scalable andreaching that goal of generalizabilitynow in the beginning this meant usingopen source Platforms in order tomaintain that flexibility that we needto operate with all of our differentbusiness units we were using open sourcetools like Cube flow pipelinesum to build and manage workflows andpromote a you know when we promotedrigorous systems of review and processesin order to make sure that we weresticking to that discipline that we setout to achieveuh gcp was our preferred platform and weprogressively used more gcp services aswe went along and again this might thisteam that I'm talking about started outat the same time that vertex AI waslaunched so we kind of wereprogressively integrating more and moreinto our system of vertex AI Solutionsas time went on we were building out newSolutionsnow some of the earliest wins that wehad were in a b testing Frameworks uhwhere we were where our teams were ableto develop um and deploy variantreduction methods that actually reducecosts and increase the speed at which wecould run tests uh we were also able todeliver Advanced recommendation systemstested a lot or something that I'll berevisiting a little bit later as well asconsumer lifetime value models andexpanded customer segmentation now theselast two in combination with the a btesting allowed us to deliver costsavings early on to the sa Lottercompanies as well as increasing spendefficiency for a lot of our marketingactivities this helped justify theexistence of my team by delivering a lotof these early results and over timegave us the clout to generate a lot moredemand from inside the company toexplore other capabilities usingartificial intelligence and machinelearning now vertex AI was a key elementof this we were using more and more ofthese these services and so that wecould spend less time worrying aboutinfrastructure and more time thinkingabout the data science Solutions wewanted to build and how we were going tobe driving business value and a keyelement of this is our developmentpartner evident who we were able to leanon for staff augmentation they were ableto help us scale resources as necessaryas a Google partner but they were alsobringing in as a as an organizationthat's familiar with Google Cloudproducts Essential Knowledge thatactually furthered our journey in dataengineering analytics as well as a lotof our machine learning effortsso here's an archive texture diagram ofwhere we we're Landing now now vertex AIplays a central role in all of this inorder to kind of keep things simple forus and again keep us focused on a lot ofthe the business deliverables that aredriving what we're doingum on top of that we also bigquery itplays a very big part in all of ouranalytics initiatives a lot of our biand total data infrastructure is builton bigquery and of course we use thingslike Google artifact registry because itintegrates well with Google Cloud toolsas well as a lot of our CI CD toolingum and that helps us automate a lot ofour Pipelinesso a lot a little bit more about thoseuse cases so Estee Lauder one of themost important experiences that we haveon our website is personalization andrecommendations are a big part of thatso vertex AI provided us access to newrecommendation tooling systems that areallowing us to deliver new ways ofactually doing personalized experienceson our websites so over time we're goingto be deploying more and more of theseto a brand dot to our brand.com sites togive consumers an increasingly uh morepersonalized experienceum and how they experience Our Brandsand our productsmore recently we've been able to exploremore uses in generative AI which I knowis something that's very interesting alot of people here but this actually wasnot a new area for us uh that guymentioned before Chris curro actuallyback in the middle of 2022 he led asmall team including an intern to use anllm to actually help us get a betterhandle on our customer care our customercall logs in order to actually moreaccurately label the reason why peoplewere calling and this allowed us toidentify issues faster and ultimatelyact on them faster so that we can createa more seamless and improved experiencefor a lot of our consumersexpanded on these use cases and startedlooking at ways in which we couldactually produce reviews digest sopeople provide us feedback on our sitesand feedback on our products and thesecome in at large volumes it's verydifficult for our business stakeholdersto actually go through all of these andfigure out what to do so llms haveallowed us to summarize these quicklywhich helps our business take you knoware the people on the business sideidentify the issues act on them quicklyand again deliver a more delightfulexperience for our consumers and make itso that these types of issues don'tcontinue to preventforeignwe've also started looking at how llmscan actually accelerate a lot of ourcreative workflows and workflows andcopy related activities uh primarilythrough variant generation these copyvariants may be you know may be used tosubstantially reduce the time andturnaround time associated with a lot ofour marketing and strategy activitiesagain freeing up time for a lot ofpeople on on who work on those workstreamsthe examples here were actually chose tobe completely inane so if you'rewondering why why is Estee Lauder youknow want to change the copy variant tobe a little bit more Sinister that'sjust my team having fun and it'ssomething I can put up here withoutbeing you know too riskyand of course more efficient andaccessible ml uh more efficient andaccessible ml environment has given abump to a lot of our commercial datascience activities allowing us todeliver and iterate faster so overallwe're continuing to improve efficiencythe more we lean on these Frameworks soall the while vertex AI has continued toevolve and we're actually integratingmore and more into the way that we doour work and it's actually creating newways for the all the people across myteam to interact with vertex AI boththrough our normal mlops environment butalso through some of the no code and nocode capabilities are coming up on theplatform itself and with that hand itback over to Jason to talk more aboutmodel Garden awesomethanks Eric that was really excitingit's amazing to see how quickly youdrove business value right from the BETand well we often see a lot of ourcustomers you get a big win to startwith and you can you can get a lot ofrope for your team to explore and that'sthat exploration really drives the thefuture of companies and so we're seeingthat all over so it's actually one ofthe really cool things about ourfoundation models they they work for alot of use cases right out of the boxand then they evolve over time as youget more and more creativespeaking of whichI'd like to talk a little bit about ourmodel Gardensothe model Garden is our opinion to takeon the best and most relevant Googleopen source and partner modelswe've integrated all of these modelswith vertex's powerful tooling so youcan get started in seconds we'll showyou some Demos in a little bitwe enable end-to-end Journeys where youcan find the perfect model for your tasktune it for your own needs and thendeploy to a custom endpoint all in a fewclicksour collection of models includes abroad array of large Foundation modelsand wide variety of more task specificonesmodel Garden is a great place to comparewhether you want to start building froman APIor work from one of our up the stacksolutions that I talked about beforeand of course the ml Ops tooling thatEric talked about before integrates withall of these models as well so you don'tneed a separate starting point forgenerative AI Foundation models that youwould for any other ml model it's allintegratedso what are you going to find in modelGardenwe have40 Foundation modelslike Google's Palm 2 and Imogenand we have 60 open source models andthese numbers are growing every time wedo another release so we started a fewmonths ago and we're up 30 percent from70 total to over 100 total nowwe are committed to providing ourcustomers with Choice while we're veryproud of Google's 1p Our Own Foundationmodels we're also committed to providingour customers with the choice for thebest models for your workload and westill want to have that be seamlesslyintegrated into vertexGoogle's been working on AI for quite awhile now so we have some task specificmodels that we've also developed andthose are available in model Gardenthings like optical characterrecognition Google created a very goodOCR algorithm when we scan the world'sbooks and we make that available to ourcustomers we've been working on itconsistently since then sentimentanalysis and then translation thingslike it's the it's the algorithm thatpowers the the free product Googletranslate as well so these are somereally powerful world-class models thatyou might not think about in the same inthe same thought process as you thinkabout something like palm2 but sometimesthese models are the right choice foryou and so we're committed to giving youthat choicethese models work across a range ofmodalities like text speech embeddingsimagesdocuments and moreone key Point here is that we think ofdocuments as their own modalitydocuments have text and images andlayout and so as we move over time intoa more multimodal worldinputs like documents are just going tobe thought of as another input formatthat's distinct from things like textand images and speechforeignso what's new todayfor those of you who are watching thekeynote some of these were uh werementioned earlierwe have20 new OSS modelsso we've been working quite quite hardon bringing the best to model Gardenso you'll hear about the upgrades to ourfoundation models in the other sessionsthis week so I'm not going to dwell onon the Google first party models toomuch let's talk a little bit more aboutthe OSS models and then our partnermodels as well so as as Thomas mentionedin the keynote we've integrated severalof meta's models into our model Gardenso llama 2 is now fully integrated andwe'll go into that in a little bit moredetail later we'll show you I'll showyou a little bit more of an examplewe've also integrated meta's code modelso codelamathose were released late last week soabout 48 business hours later we've gotthem up and running in model Garden sowe are committed to being at The CuttingEdge of the best open source modelreleasesthis week as mentioned about an hour agowe were also pre-announcing Claude 2anthropics model as a pre-announcementfor it will soon be available andintegrated into our model Gardenso we offer first party open source andpartner models all in one place allintegrated with vertex's toolingone thing that is particularly it's adecision that we made is that we're notjust providing for the vast vastmajority of these models we're not justproviding a link to a repo somewhere asan open source model that integrationthings like responsible AI toolingthings like there's bias evaluationtooling and then just pure modelevaluation comparing the results of onemodel versus another model that kind oftooling and integration with all of ourexisting ml Ops tooling that kind oftooling comes out of the box with modelGardenlet's go into some use case deep Divesand for here we're going to do a demoso I will let the team switch over andturn my computer onthere we goso as my colleague mentioned earlierthis morning we'll see how live demos goyou know it's live if something goeswrongso here you can see this is the TheOpening screen for model Garden when youclick on model Garden or Cloud console Iwould expect that most of you who aredeveloping tooling for your Enterpriseswould be building your own applicationsto deploy many of your business userswon't necessarily be coming to theGoogle Cloud console for the purposes ofdemonstrating here I wanted to give youall the the very bleeding edge look atwhat we're doingsoas Eric mentioned one of his use casesis around marketing so we're seeing alot of marketing teams generate contentand a lot of it is fixing a blank pageproblem right you show up at thebeginning of the day and I want to thinkof four or five different options Iwrite me copy for each and let's go talkabout it edit it see which one the bestone is but let's get started it'sgenerative AI is really amazing forthose types of use casestodaylet's use vertex to generate inspirationfor a blog post for a healthy snackproduct line at a consumer package goodscompany so we need a Blog title contentpossible hashtags and things like thatfor social media sharing and then aheadline image so we're looking atgenerating some text in some differentformats and also an imageso to get started in model Gardenwe have Palm 2 right here I can navigateand searchon top so I could search language or orpick any of the other so once if youdon't know which model you want to startwith it's great tooling to start herethere are also filters on thisnavigation as well so you've gotlanguage Vision speech tabular datadocuments video and you can look atthere's different tasks classificationdetection extraction there's all sortsof all sorts of options to start fromtoday for this task I know I want to goright to Palm 2 for textthis is this is that you know it's liveso when you come to the come to themodel card there's a lot of data hereand I will make it slightly bigger I'mnot expecting everyone to read this thepoint is that we're providing codeexamples you can go right to API codeyou can go to this evaluation so youcould run your test cents to get testsets against the model you've gotoverviews we give some detail on usecasesand then we have documentation forgetting started including the commandline documentation if you're going touse python as your as your programminglanguageso for today I'm most concerned aboutlet's just generate some text right awayso here's where we can do some someprompt engineering you'll see here againI'll make this slightly bigger so thateveryone can seeso these are the models that areavailable to you as developers obviouslyyou'd pick the right API endpoint tobake into your applications here you canwork right with the the latest endpointsand so we have some experimental onesthe latest one here knows that this is athis is your non-version bleeding edgerelease and then this zero zero one youknow it's a stable release so if you ifyou choose to build an application ontop of it uh it's it's subject to ourgenerally available terms for stablereleaseslet's pick the latest version of textbisonover here there are some settings forthose of you who have been playing withthis I think some of these are going toseem familiar we have some new ones aswell so temperature is a measure of thecreativity of the modellet's crank it up a little bit we'reregenerating fun text so let's let's gowildtoken limit tokens about four charactersso if you want to think about tokens youcan have uh these this endpoint goes upto 8 000 tokens and then there's thisother endpoint here which is 32 000tokensso these are new releases and areexpanding our our token length from theprevious releases from before this weekas wellwe'll go down here you can generatemultiple responsestwo otherum very new releases as of todayso streaming so this is uh these modelsgenerate tokens and so what you wantfrom a user experience the latency onthese models because they're doing a lotof compute can feel like it's a longlatency so you can actually see the textbeing written uh each token as it getsoutput by the model so it actually thetime to First token latency and the timeto last token latency are very differentthings so if you're looking here ifyou're trying to make your users feellike the model is running fasteryou enable streamingand there's another piece right herecalled enable groundingthis one's interesting we released it wejust announced it about an hour agogrounding for most of you who are goingto be dealing with the problem of modelhallucination there's a there's aoverall issue that these models have andthis the temperature control on the topcan helps to control that hallucinationa little bit this grounding herelets you customize against your ownEnterprise data so return me an answerthat's consistent with do you have an HRmanual do you are you doing somethinginternal and do you want to give the doyou want to have an HR chat bot that'sthe what are my 401k contribution what'swhat's the employer match this yearwhich is different than what is the IRSlimit right that's a that's public datathis is your own company's data so ifyou want your models to be respondingwith item with with information that isrelevant to your own company's data thisis where you go firstfor today we're going to do a little bitsimpler version of a of a demoand so we won't we won't be grounding onanything external but I highly encourageeveryone who's wonderedcan we release something that'sconsistent with our brand guidelines ordo we have do we have a manual forfixing one of our Fleet of vehiclesagain I want to answer questions againstit these are these are all real usecases that our customers have come to uswith real life problems in in how wedeveloped our grounding solution for nowI'm just going to cut and paste a promptthat I've developed where we want amultimedia campaign to highlightthis healthy snack so we're coming backto that original examplewe've got a bunch of facts differentingredients we're using grounding maybewe'd actually have the recipe for ourgranola bar we just put that into thegrounding source and also all of ourother sustainable practicesat the end I've just prompted for aheadline a blog post a caption andhashtagsandwe willI have to disable grounding there we gonow the submit button worksso I have streaming so you're going tosee the time to First token it's goingto be a few seconds and then you'll justsee the the content oh there we gothat's how you know it's livewe'll switch overif I sit and talk for too long thingstime out in the background tooumso while this one reloadsokaythere we goI hope the internet in here didn't stopworkingyou've seen all the settings Let Me Waitfor this one to reload and let's talkquickly about imagesso for imageswe have a model called imagine it's oneof Google's models first P modelsI'd like to make a header imageso if I click on thatit's entirely possible the internetdecided to stop working just as I clicksubmitwant to run it off your phone again yeahwe can hotspot off my phone we werejoking about that earlierumlet's flip back because I know we onlyhave a few minutes left so let'sactually let's flip back out of the demoand let me uh let me flip back it is ait is a sad State I apologizeumwe willlet's try one other time let's see ifit'll see if it'll come up yeah I'm notwe're just not getting anything at allsolooks like we're having someconnectivity issues solet's let's slip back to the slidesokay thank youI chose to do one live demo everythingelse on slides this happensso for this one let's talk about adigital assistant and let's let's decidethat we're going to start with metaslamatoo so now available in model Garden aswe said before you can open up thatmodel card that I showed before to learnmore about itwe have another button right here opennotebook we released today we'veactually rebased our notebook solutionto be an Enterprise version of Googlecollab so it's the the notebooks thatyou know and love from collab are nowdirectly integrated with vertexin here I can clickright on the deploy buttonI pick the model name that I want for myendpoint save it and it ends up right inthe vertex model registryfrom thereone more click deploy to custom endpointthat's how easy it is to get startedwith llama2 you can get an endpoint upin a matter of 10 or 15 secondsbut what if I wanted a more customsolution what if I wanted to tune thismodel with my own data so we'veintegrated model tuning with llama2within within model garden and right outof the box soto do this I go into notebookand then I canpage through the notebook so I can stepthrough the that fine tuning notebookand I can explore both parameterefficient fine tuning and reinforcementlearning with human feedback tuning sorlhfwe'll come back to those in a minuteso both tuning and deploymentare done within my gcp tenant where Ihave full control and ownership of mydataso it's an Enterprise Enterprise usecase your data is your dataI can also perform responsible AI checksthat are powered by the vertex contentmoderation API right on the output ofthe tuned bottlefor those of you who aren't familiarwith rlh it's one of the most powerfultuning methods out there todayfor rhef you have two data sets one's apreference data set that lets you traina reward model the other is a promptdata set with unlabeled data think likethumbs up thumbs down information fromyour userswe feed your prompt data setto the foundation model to generateoutputs and then we score the outputswith the reward model assign a reward weprocess this through the reinforcementlearning step to tune the foundationmodel by updating the model weightsusing the objective to maximize therewardat the end of the pipeline you get amodel that is learned to perform betterbased on this human feedback it's one ofthe techniques that's showing the mostpromise along with so this one inPerimeter efficient tuning of the twowe're seeing have the best results andthese tuning jobs are not particularlyexpensiveas I mentioned beforewe offer enterprise controlsfor the models that you use in vertex soyour data is your datafor those of looking for those of youlooking to deploy generative AI in yourcompanies we've got everything that youwould have expected from any other modelusing vertex also works for ourfoundation modelswe don't train with your datawe pass rigorous certifications toensure your data remains secure andwe're committed to keeping up with allof the global regulation around AIwe also as Sundar has mentioned severaltimes we are bold get responsible so wealso have a wide variety of responsibleAI toolingI won't get into all of these in depthbut I mentioned that content moderationAPI think of it as knobs and knobs thatyou can tune to restrict the outputs ofyour models if you don't want the modeltalking politics turn that down to zeroif you want that model to talk aboutsomething else like a like a healthproblem so if you're if you're running aConsulting chat bot for for healthissues you can turn that up if you don'twant that you turn it down so we offer16 different knobswe have our built-in technicalsafeguards we have checks to make sureyour model doesn't violate copyrightand then we also have bias evaluationtooling so our teams our responsibly AIteams have developed a prettysophisticated set of tooling that youcan test your model against manydifferent uh groups and we have somereally differentiated data sets rightnow you'll see those are are running innotebooks and we'll be progressing thosedirectly into vertex later this year sothe the bottom two are not integratedyet with open source models and the toptwo areso I've gone through my my tuning stepand now I'm ready to deploy like I saidI showed before so now you've got thetuned version of this model I can deployit right to an endpointwe have time for one more use casethis one's pretty near and dear toGoogle's heart it's around productsearch so finding the thing that you'relooking fora lot of businesses looking to helpcustomers discover cool products orfeatures really don't have great toolingon their websites to help that happen sothere are some cool technologies that wecan combineto create some really robust productsearch so in this example say I'm thechief data scientist for a sportinggoods store and I want to add this kindof search capability to our onlinestorefront so that we can help ourcustomers find what they're looking forin this case say I recently read aboutsomething called text embeddings andthat's very interestingwhat embeddings are our representationof things like product descriptions soTech Snippets in a vector spaceand so we can use the difference betweenthese vectors to understand similarityso you're reducing the tech snippet intoa numberand then you're trying to see the howfar these numbers are apart from eachother essentially it's a little morecomplicated than that I'm not a vectorspecialist but we have some good toolingout of the box to help you figure thisoutit's a two-step process first in modelGarden I navigate to embeddings for textin the model Garden Tab and I can goview API codeso what you're seeing here is textembeddings gecko it's our highlyperformant model for embeddingsI can use this to generate embeddingsand we have some customers doing this atscale already it's one of our mostpopular modelswe want to pair this next with thevertex AI matching engine which is ourmanaged Vector databasethe matching engine has built-in supportfor this Vector similarity thing that Ispoke about beforewhich is exactly these these twotogether so you're going to think ofembeddings plus the matching enginetogether can give you a really robustand Powerful product searchcouple examplesso the top rank product for pets istable tennis rackets XL bright color soif you're looking for to enable searchfor your customersthis is where I'd recommend starting andit and it uses a generative AI model forembeddingswe also recently probably three or fourweeks ago released an image embeddingsmodelso you can take the images on yourwebsites and also reduce them intoVector space and search on themthis is the start of what we think aboutis converging multimodal convergence sonow I can do the search on text and Ican do the search on imageso if you if you run a retail websiteand you're looking to help yourcustomers understand red dress and youdon't have product descriptions for ared dress this is where I'd suggest youstart I'd start with image embeddings aswelltake a look model Gardenstay here long enough for folks to takea quick picturethe generative AI studio in model GardenI promise your accounts will actuallywork right out of the box it's only myaccounts that don't workthank you"
