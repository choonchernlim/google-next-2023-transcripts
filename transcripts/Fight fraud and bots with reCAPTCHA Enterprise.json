credential stuffingaccount fraud payment fraud Botsphishing malware whatever you name it sohopefully it's going to be enjoyable I'mgoing to live on purpose a lot of timefor Q a as well for folks to come andask your questions but this is supposedto be a fun session so hopefully you'llenjoy it before we get startedum I'm butter I'm the product managerfor two products recaptcha Enterpriseand web risk I've been at Google foractually about eight and a half years atthis stage spent a lot of my careersactually fighting a lot of you know badstuff that people do on the internet andI started my career at Google protectingsearch users against everything that'sbad links that's how I kind of fell inlove with the team called safe browsingthat protects the world against fishingmalware social engineering links I Ijoined the team to help actually fightall of this across Google services fromGmail adsEtc and then more recently I joinedactually the recapture and webris teamsto make sure that actually we can bringa lot of what we've done to make Googlebetter at protecting itself againstaccount takeovers and fraud and Bots toin the hands of our customers right soit's a bit of my background and so feelfree to actually ask questions andstories in the Q a at the endtoday we're going to actually cover afew things one is what kind ofreestablished basis on where recaptureEnterprise is at today what it is I knowa lot of you think that is eithersquiggly letters or challenges but it'sa lot more than that and then we will becovering also ATO and fake accountseverything that has to do with leakedcredentials phishing credential theftEtc how can recapture Enterprise helpthere and also we'll be coveringeverything around payment fraud sochargebacks Etc like how actually it'sbeing used out there in the Wild by someof our customers to protect their usersand then we'll do through a demo wherewe'll actually demonstrate how you as adeveloper or a business owner you canleverage our solution to protectyourself and your usersumgreat soquick you know level setting recaptureis now frictionless it's beenfrictionless since 2018.you know since 2017 a lot of peoplethink of us as a squiggly letters thenthe Beloved by the internet challenge aswell that everybody probably has solvedat least a few times in their lifetimesum since actually 2018 we launched aninvisible version and I think it's thefirst time that we kind of announcedthat on stage but more like the majorityof our traffic today runs on ourinvisible version of recaptcha so wemade a lot of strides there to make surethat businesses and every of every sizesfrom small mom and pop shops all the waythrough some of the largest companiesout there can protect themselves WithoutReally blocking users with thesechallengesum and what we're seeing here really isa few things one this was our bet tomake sure that in the future withoutchallenge we actually have a robust wayto protect users and applications butalso it's a real Testament that this issomething that developers needed outthere so really here having you knowmajority of our traffic over 50 runthrough that invisible version is aclear statement of hopefully somethingthat you may have noticed is that yousolve less and less of these challengestoday so you can thank all thedevelopers that have adopted this and ifyou haven't already give it a tryin 2020 we've actually evolved theproduct to be recapture Enterprise sorecapture Enterprise is basically thinkof it of the the Enterprise version thatcan scale with your business it's partof Google Cloud security so it's a gcpproduct you accept new terms when yousign up with recaptcha Enterprise whichare the gcp terms we provide slas slosand a lot more new features that canallow you to protect yourselves againstdifferent use cases that we'll becovering and deep diving on todayright another strength of this is thatobviously a lot of people are actuallytrusting recapture and it's there is areason why you actually have encounteredit at least once in your lifetime isthat it's because it's on over 6 millionsites today and growing so when Istarted actually on this role over acouple years ago in genre capture wewere about four million sites and thishas been growing at quite a rapid ratejust because a lot of people from everysizes of every business size believesand trusts in this in this and we'rereally committed to keeping it being areally important part of theinfrastructure of the internet toactually protect against bots and allother types of Roadbut really the the thing that happenedabout three years ago when we launchedrecapture Enterprise came from the factthat a lot of us actually sat down andthought we have all of these sites thattrust us we have all of these use casesthat there that they're actuallyprotecting themselves against usingrecaptcha but what are the use caseswhere we could actually make a dent andhelp these businesses build around andreally what came out is a few things oneis we needed to make sure that weprotect account protections everythingaround protections and account fraudthink credential stuffing true Factorauthentication password Leak Detectionfake accounts phishing Etc so everythingthat has to do with an account loss or afake account created on an applicationand that's used by using bots in essencewe were a bot management solution threeyears ago today we're a full frontsolution where you can rely on us forthings that are Beyond Botsthe Second Use case and all of thiscomes from the data and how people wereusing us is payments fraud paymentsfraud has you know a lot of issuesaround chargebacks erroneous rejectionsof real users trying to check out andthis relies on a lot of data andvisibility which luckily we have withour six million websites that we protectbut also with all the teams internallyat Google that are building risk modelsthat we've partnered with to bring thatin the hands of customers and lateractually we'll be looking at how this isbeing used in the real world by some ofour customers to protect themselvesagainst everything around chargebacksand payment fraudscraping use case obviously for a lot ofe-commerce sites this is actually vitalfor a lot of traveling travel platformsthis is important because that allowssome competitors to do scalping orcutting them so we're also providing alot of protection there and really thephilosophy behind this when we launchedrecapture Enterprise was two thingsaround these three use case Three coreuse cases one you should be able to runus on all devices that your users use toaccess your application what that meansis we are able to actually be embeddedin a WAFF so that you can actually blockthe traffic you know at the first layerover the wire this is great forstreaming platforms I still rely onsetup BoxesEtctwo is to make sure that we provide youas good an experience for your users andprotection both on your native apps thatyou develop as well as the web the webis what we've been doing really well for15 years what we've brought here is umactually things like you know nativesdks that you can embed in IOS andAndroid there are dynamically updated soyou don't have to update your app everytime we update recaptcha and so reallythis is a there's been this has been apush we've done and we'll see later someof the launches that we've made that areactually going in that direction likefor example our integration our nativeintegration into Cloud armoron the other end we also understand thatdevelopers rely on multi-cloudmulti-platform Etc so you can actuallytake recapture and you put you candeploy it wherever you are it doesn't ifyou're a gcp customer obviously you havesome gains from the fact that it'snatively implemented vidcp but if you'rean AWS customers if you're running yourown backend if you're running your appsanywhere you should be able to deployrecaptcha so that you know you you canrely on that infrastructure that you'vealready built so that we don't come inyour way and try to force you into somepieces of infrastructure that you're notusing today so that's kind of thephilosophy and core tenets around reallybeing a developer-centric platform andthat around these three use cases andmore rightnow some of the things we've done in thepast three years that you may have seenis actually launching a few moreproducts and features that will allowyou to actually protect your sitesagainst these use cases first thing wedid is actually recapture Enterprise inessence is a fairly young product eventhough you know looking at the marketand the adoption of the product isstarting to become more and moreubiquitous in taking its space we'rehere in March 2020 we launched recapscience into gaso ja stands for General availabilitymeaning that anyone can actually comeand grab the productsecond thing we did was our Cloud armorintegration let native integrationactually allows you to deploy it todeploy that get the score from acaptioner price or a risk score fordistributed human or robot and over thewire following all your rules be able toactually remove some of the kind of easybot traffic so they don't even hit yourapplication rightumother thing we did is we capturepassword Leak Detection we'll cover morein details what it is but really thisallows you to detect if a user loggingin onto your platform is using leakscredentials and leaks and that databaseis a partnership that we've done withthe password checkup team at Google it'sa similar database as per that's helpingyou protect your accounts on Chrometoday so you receive an alert tellingyou to change your passwords we're usingvery similar database in order to powerthis productthe native mobile SDK is both forAndroid and iOS in November 2022 welaunched that allow you to protect yournative apps as well as your pro you canprotect the web your web applicationrecapture account Defender GA was a bigparading shift in the way we're actuallyprotecting accounts as opposed to tryingto answer the question is this a bot orhuman this is actually trying to answerthe question is this the right personcoming back is this a fake accountshould I 2fa this user can I let themthrough can I save can I save SMS moneyby not authenticating this user Etcand then finally and the one that I'mpersonally like very proud of and likereally excited about is everything wrongrecapture fraud prevention that we didearlier this year that actually allowsbusinesses business businesses toprotect themselves against chargebackand other types of Fraud and we're goingto do a really nice Deep dive into whatthat looks like for you as a developerwhat type of scores we give you and howthat's integrated with other parts ofthe ecosystem that Google offersso right now we'll zoom on account fraudthis is actually the largest use casethat our customers sign up for becausethis is really our strength and whatwe've been doing best for the past 15yearsit's really kind of to go back and levelset sort of make sure everybody's on thesame page the ATO problem unfortunatelyrelies on a very simple problem is thefact that people reuse their passwordsit's it sounds crazy that in 2023 2023we still have this problem but literallyif you think about it how often are youactually prompted when you install a newapplication with you creating a newpassword for a new account that you nowhave to manage on your application andthat problem makes it that if this dataleaks somewhere so one of theapplication the 100 applications that Iuse on my phonehas a data leak that makes any otherapplication vulnerable for an accounttakeover for that specific account rightanother thing is more and more servicesespecially since kovid have moved onlinemore and these accounts are becomingmore and more important today you can doyour taxes online you can buy food youcan get your groceries you can monitorhow your kids are doing at daycare youcan you know manage your bank accountEtc which makes actually now to date theaccount of a user a really strong assetfor a customer right or for an attackerto get their hands on it so veryimportant and obviously scaling botattacks is cheaper than ever you knowinfrastructure costs are coming downbut as a service is a thing you canactually ask people to run them for youas long as you get your hands on thedatabase of leak credentials they can doit on your behalfanother thing is attackers really relyon a few things in order to be able todo these account takeovers number one aswe said stolen credentials stolencredential pairs meaning users andpasswords they need bots in automationor click Farms so clickfiring is beinghumans actually doing uh the attackright that is becoming more and moreprevalent and parts of the worldespecially as accounts have become moreand more valuable so for example thinkof a crypto exchange if I get my handson your crypto there is no way to claimthose back but those accounts are verycan are like very um attractive toattackers for example and that meansthat actually it's cheaper to even pay ahuman to do this attack as opposed to abot given that the reward at the end isreally higheverything that they need is alsosimilarly to you as business owners theyneed the network they need devices theyneed infrastructure and that's a veryimportant point because we protect 6million websites so we've had instanceswhere customers actually deployrecaptcha and so their traffic of botsdrop because if we fingerprint one botit's actually it propagating to the SixMillion sites we protect so that's kindof a deterrent already just having itthere on the page and then obviouslyanything around stolen or hijacked phonenumbers and emails for MFA for exampleor being able to bypass two-factorauthentication in the worst cases we'veseen with financial institutionssometimes the attackers are even on thephone with the victim unfortunateso here we actually what we'll do isthat we'll really walk through this theall these things that we've justdiscussed and give you reallyum an overview of how we're thinkingabout the problem and why we've broughtsome of these Solutions and features toMarketthe first solution that we've builtwhich is I think one of the mostimportant we've built because that's oneof the easiest way for any businessowner to make sure that the passwordhygiene of their customers is clean thispassword link detection password LeakDetection allows you in line at themoment of login sign up password resetto check against our database whetherthe user is using leaks credentialsbased on our database of billions ofentries that we either purchase fromvendors that we Harvest ourselves thatwe've done that we had collaboratingwith Google and it's actually constantlyupdated to make sure that you know youcan keep your users safethis has no fancy ML and AI yet it'sliterally a kind of Boolean answer on isthis person at risk of getting hijackedbecause they're using stolen credentialsand if yesprompt them to change their passwordit's the easiest thing you can do toprotect accounts even before you getinto the fancy machine learning and AIyou can do over this problemso and that's the great thing about thisis that it's directly integrated inrecapture Enterprise so when you ask foran assessment from recaptcha meaningwhen you ask recapture hey do you thinkthis is a bot or human at the same timeyou can ask for captcha hey is the arethese credentials clean based on yourdatabaseanother strength of this product is thatwe've taken a different approach thanthe competition we're not providing youan answer on whether this password isrisky because we've seen it acrossmultipledatabases we're answering the questionof are is this credential pair leakedsomewhere on the web which is veryunique to the user meaning that you canwith confidence tell the user you are atrisk because I know that your accounthas been linked somewhere all of this isdone in the privacypreserving manner we're providingblinders in a way that we are not ableto see these credentials in plain textwhat should what we do is that we returnthe hash prefix matches and then you canmap that to that user right so this isgreat for everyone as like in governmentfor example or like want to protecttheir constituents without giving awaysome data that allows you to do that ina privacy preserving manner where Googlehas no way to know what thesecredentials are it's a one-wayencryption methodsecond is of course the credentialStaffing attack starts what you need forthe credential stuffing attack is Botsor humans but in this case what we'vedone is you know you've got yourrecapture Enterprise score between zeroand one zero being a bot one being ahuman in increments of 0.1 so you have11 scores that you can use in order toactually act against the bot attack orthink of a challenge you can throw themor think of an MFA you can present themso at this stage of the attack actuallywhat you're able to do with one API callreturn to your under 100 milliseconds ina Json format meaning you're the onlyperson that sees that as a response theattacker has no idea about what you'regetting back we're able to answer thequestion are these credentials clean arethey actually vulnerable at beingattackedand is the support or human trying toperpetrate the attack now in the oldworld of Bot management we'll probablyjust tell you I think this is a bot onmy login page or my login actiontherefore I think this isa credential Staffing attackwhat we've done is that actually we wenta step further and we launched theaccount Defender account Defender alsolives on top of recaptcha with the sameaccount requests the same requestassessment you'll get an extra signalthat will answer the question is thisbatter coming back to his account or isthis someone trying to log in on hisbehalf right and what we do is that wereturn you a label that will sayis this suspicious login activity isthis for example for an account creationis this a suspicious account creationbut really all of this is powered bywhat we call the profile matching engineand that profile matching is looking athundreds of signals for that user everytime they log in to make sure that whenone day there is a deviation in theirnormal behavior we can use as a businessowner or developer alert you thatsomething fish is going on make sure youdo a fail this user and that's a paddingshift because in the attack where thecredentials are clean and it is a humanit doesn't mean that it's better comingback trying to log in on his Gmailaccount and that's really like TheParting shift that we've done withaccount Defenderand of course then we offer recaptchaMFA which allows you to Twitter youruser by sending an oh no TP via email wealso have on our roadmap to allow folksto bring their own SMS provider in orderto trigger natively with the recaptchascore and SMS verification and all ofwhich is also protected by your SMSfraud solution that we recently launchedin private preview so you can save onthose SMS dollars because we know thisyear it's been painful for Developersthen of course everything you can do inorder to reduce this password frictionin MFA is account Defender helps youactually withum that profile match and a risk engineit allows you to actually save on SMSdollars in this case or for exampleavoid that friction of always asking auser to MFA to pass their OTP Etcdepending on the business financialinstitutions actually appreciate thatfriction they don't mind it I think youknow when you have more inpatient usersthat are using your platforms it mightbe actually frustrating to have toeither pass a recapture challenge or MFAso this is a good way for you toactually build that profile over time ofthe user and allow them to bypass a lotof the MFA frictionanother thing that's really important isanother way to lose your credentials isphishing right this has been there sincethe internet has been around but reallywhat we do here is if you've ever heardof safe browsing which protects 5billion devices around the world it'sbeen doing it for 17 years it's embeddedin most browsers and we showed big redinterstitial to users in those browsersand devices that allows you to submit tous any phishing page that you know istargeting your brand or your business sothat we can block it in these fivebillion devices so here actually at thatstage of the attackagain you're able to say is are thesecredentials leaked on the dark websomewhere is this a bot or humanis this actually an account takeoverrisk or not should I 2fa this persontrigger the 2fasubmit the phishing pages to recapturethrough web risk and safe browsing forprotection phishing protectionand make sure that you actually don'tadd friction for your profile matchesand your real users are coming backif you think about three years ago theonly question you could have been youwould have been able to answer is isthis a bot or a human which only givesyou part of the story and this is reallywhere we're going with this and most ofthis is available both on mobile on weband through our web Integrationsand finally of course like one thing wewanted to mention is we recentlyreleased in private preview an SMS fraudsolution so toll fraud has been a sorepoint for developers this year weactually pivoted part of our roadmapbecause of that there hasn't been Ithink a single month where I talked toour customers where SMS fraud and toldfraud has been brought up as an issueand we've recently released the scoreactually that you can use in order toreduce SMS fraud where we will give youa likeliness for an SMS to be SMS fraudso you can block it before you send itto the user right now the model is thatwhen that SMS is gone from uh to for theverification you have to pay for it whatrecaptcha can do here similar to paymentfraud is that you can block it up frontso you can save on those SMS dollars andwe know that in some regions of theworld this SMS prices have skyrocketedto 90 cents an SMS for verificationwhich can be very expensiveSecond Use case is really everythingaround bulk config account creationsimilarly here recaption Enterpriseallows you to say is this a bot or humantrying to create a an account very easyway for you to feel to Rack bulk fakeaccount creation Now assuming these arehumans what account Defender does isthat on top of this it gives you asignal that will tell you suspiciousaccount creationthat is trained based on you know themillions and billions of interactions wesee coming through our platform andwe've built models that allow us torecognize when a fake account creationis in is happening because of forexample a bot or a human or a click FarmEtc what's great about this is that thisis a an API response again so theattacker doesn't know that you're on tothem at that stage meaning that you canearmark that account and maybe limitsome functionalities on your websiteuntil you verify that they're a genuineuserfake accounts are a big issue especiallyfor companies that are growing at a fastpace you know when you need to report toyour investors your actual growthnumbers that's an issue if these areactually biased by bots so really whatwe're doing here is trying to give youall these tools to be able to clean upthose those Bots that created theaccounts on your platformbut the most important piece here is therelated accounts API once you'veidentified that bad seed usually if youdon't have a large company you don'tnecessarily have a fraud or trust andsafety team that can go and investigateeach and every account and go and takeit downwhat the related accounts API allows youto do is actually to speed up thatprocess so it's almost if you had afraud team that went and investigatedfor that specific account all the otheraccounts that belong to the sameattacker why this is important becausewe're doing a lot of clustering and MLand AI in the background to do thisclustering right so it's an unsupervisedlearning model that based on all thesignals that we collect based on networkdevices and behavior on the page we'reable to tell you like hey you know likethis account that you just gave me thereis about 150 other accounts that pertainto the same attacker therefore if youwant to take it down you can take itdown if you want to disable them Etc youcan with the related accounts API sovery powerful tool to save you time andmoney on the investigation andenforcementand here again you know you with a SMSfraud that's a great way for you toblock these accounts so that you haveless of these fake accounts that createsthat SMS fraud problem for youall right zoom on payment fraudandreallyum this year has been for us it's been areally a turning point when we launchedthis in May of 2023.um we've launched this uh this new uhproduct called fraud prevention and whatprev fraud prevention does is reallyprotect that payment page so for thepast 10-15 minutes we've actually wewent on through the case of what we'redoing to help you create and protectthat account that's your first step intomaking sure that fraud is not as rampanton your on your website the reason forthat is over 75 80 of fraud startseither from an ATO or a fake accountand the rest is probably you know youcan attribute it to Friendly fraud Etcwhat we've done here is how can weactually provide a solution thatcombines the power of recaptcha isvisibility over 6 million sites and thesignals that we collect therewith other parts of Google so that wecan actually provide a full fraudsolution for your payments in order toactually solve a few things one iseverything around chargebacks which cancost a lot of money to businesses andthen on the other end how can we helpyou improve your erroneous rejectionrate meaning you know how do we avoidthat you have to actually reject theuser when you've spent all thesemarketing dollars and at The Last Milewhen they're on your payment page youreject them because you know you have asolution that maybe is over conservativeon that fraud problemso read that's what we've done and thenyou know everything's powered by thesame people that build recapture theaccount protection Suite that we justbuilt and really is like protecting oversix million sites and one trilliontransactionsand here what we've done is a lot ofthings you know have come together overthe years over the past three years whatwe've done is not just build thisproduct we build these Partnershipswithin Google so that we can leverageeach other's fraud intelligence to maketo put it in the hands of our customersto be able to protect themselves as wellas we protect ourselves that all startswith recaptcha because recaptcha isalready present on your page it'salready protecting your page but on topof that we've Pro we've partnered withteams like Google payments team thathelps us build those risk models we'repartnering with safe browsing to helpyou protect yourselves again you knowphishing malware social engineering thatcan lead to credential theft for exampleand of course above all of this onceactually this is all deployed on yourpage it allows us to build thosetailored models and custom models onyour page and on your for your businessbased on the annotations we receive fromyou to data we see on your end and sothat we can have not just the one out ofthe box model that works for everyonebut actually custom models that work foryouand right here what we've done is if youthink about the way it normally workseither on one hand one of your vendorwill have a large visibility oneverythinginstrument right so they will be able totell you you know based on myintelligence and my network of users Iknow that this credit card is bad I knowthat this debit card is badunfortunately this is just part of thestory the real story here is who thatperson is is this an account takeover isthis a hijacked is it a fake account iswhat Behavior have I seen from this userin the past on my websiteand what is the reputation of this userover the Six Million sites when itinteracts with themand really when you think about itrecaptcha brings that perspectiveGoogle pay and those teams help us Ishould bring that on our end and when webuild those risk models together itgives you a powerful signal to use inorder to reject or accept a transactionon your site or accept or reject acertain user on your siteand here there is a lot more data thatyou know we've built in terms of likeinputs we have Merchants data paymentprocessors blogs and websitesmarketplaces all of that fits into ourmodels so that we can build more moreand better models across those sixmillion sitesand so now actually the way we'vestructured this again if you think aboutthe way we were thinking aboutapproachingum the release of recaptch Enterpriseit's a developer-centric platformmeaning that we want to put in yourhands the tools that you need the scoresthat you need and maybe blend them withyour own fraud engine other solutionsthat you're using in vendorsso what we do is that we return you afew scores number one transaction riskthe probability of the transactionshould be fraudulent this is you knowwhat you want to use in order toactually add on top of your ownintelligence whether you should rejectthis transaction or notbut we're not stopping there what wewant is to make sure that you know whatare some of the other signals we provideor we we had in order to make thatdecision the first one is what's thelikeliness of this instrument to bestolen that's all the intelligence wehave built and gathered from workingwith other risk teams that have helpedus build those models so here you'll beable to say well you know what there is100 chance that this is a bad instrumentI should probably reject thistransactiontwo is what's the likeliness of thiscard testing being car testing meaningare these Bots or humans trying to washa certain number of credit cards thatthey bought on the dark web for exampleto see if they are valid on this websiteso we're giving you a score for that andone of the most important thing is thebehavioral trust verdict what thatallows you to do is to make sure thatyou can retain all of these users thatyou've spent marketing dollars bringingto your platform coming at the checkoutpage and be able to actually reduce thaterroneous rejection rate and that'sactually based on you know a lot of datathat we see on for that user acrossthose websites have they actuallychecked out have they been actually afraudulent user in another platform etcetc and this is great because this isactual dollars that you've saved andthat's an actual customer acquisitioncost that you can bring down as opposedto attribute to you know your fraudsolution being too conservativewe actually have a great use case thatwe've shared recently unfortunately wecan't have the customer on stage talkabout it but GoFundMe is actually usingempowered by recaptcha fraud preventiontoday and what the way they're doing itis that they're checking whether aspecific solution or a specifictransaction on the page is fraudulentand you know that unlocks millions ofdollars in additional funds with securetransactions that's frictionless anduser experience meaning that if you'vedonated recently in any GoFundMecampaign for example for the Maui firesand so on all of that was actually inthe background protected by recaptionand price fraud preventionthere is an informal machine learningmodels with recapture responses and theymitigate attacks in real time meaningthat everything we've described happensin real time at the moment the userclicks on pay check out login registerunder 100 milliseconds and that's a verypowerful tool that you can add on top ofyour your solutionand really on their in their own wordsin in Matthew's own words recaptureprevent Enterprise fraud prevention isfantastic at targeting bad payments andmitigating them in real time while atthe same time allowing payments to gothrough with minimum friction in thecase ofof GoFundMe this means that you knowcauses actually receive the dollars thatwould have otherwise been you know inthe hands of attackers and fraudsters sothat's one of our favorite customers wehad to we deployed this with and we'rehappy to actually yield a great resultswithgreat we have about 15 minutes leftwe'll do a quick demo so I can show youwhat this looks like inwhat how you can consume those scoreshow you how they look like in terms ofresponse and maybe look at different usecases for example if a user has loggedin or if a user is trying to check outso that you can actually see what thatwill look like for you as a businessI'm just gonna log in herehope I don't type my password in frontof everyone in plain textall rightyeahokay all right so going back to like thepresentation the early presentation wementioned really today recaptcha isinvisible so for you in the room who hadnever used recaptcha invisible the wayit works is that you get a score back sowhen a user tries to log inbutand they click on sign inyou'll be able to actually get aresponse that will tell you whether itis user when trying to log in are theyboth origin oh sorry I think we haveof course the demo gods are not happybecause the internet is not workingin a secondall rightI'm just gonna reload this real quickit's always when you need the demo thatit doesn't workum makes it seem more real exactly yeahat least you know now that it's notstageduh great I think we're back on all rightso the Enterprise page there you go solet's assume that a user tries to log inhereand when they click loginwhat you get here iswith a simple implementation ofrecaptcha obviously it's under yourtoken that allows us to just identifythe fact that this is you we get yoursite key that's attached to your tokenso what we can certify that this isindeed coming from your application soyou know when we have bad requests andyou know broken tokens Etc that areusually attackers trying to pretend thatthey're you we can reject thoseassessments and you have what we callexpected actions this is a veryimportant piece of the puzzle becausewhen you specify that for example thisis a login page a sign up page thatallows these the action specific modelsto trigger meaning that recaptcha whenthey see that it's a login page and youactually specify it will be able to makesure that you receive you know the loginprotection models as opposed to thegeneric models robot managementnow the good thing also is that you geta risk score so here what happened is ifthis was a real user trying to log in onyour pageyou'll get this score and you'd be ableto say you know what this is actually agenuine user this is not a bot I'm goingto let them through now we can look at adifferent use case with account Defenderfor that same user trying to log inso as we said earlierum you know account Defender was reallypart of the shift in the way we'reapproaching things because it allows usto really track over time how the useris behavinghow are they behaving on your login pageand whether or not this user should beletting should be letting into yourapplicationand so here in this example what youprovide us on top of in your request iswhat we call the hashtag count ID so theconcept of hashtag account ID is reallyahashed version of the constant that youuse to track the user on yourapplication we do this just because weactually don't need to know that it's aGmail account a Yahoo account all wewant to know is that this is the sameuser coming back so we ask for thatconstant so we can track over time howdo they behave what network are theyusing what device are they using inorder to login into your page so we cancompute that risk score over timewe're also like gonna introduce a wayfor you to send us plain text emailaddresses for example or usernames ifyou want but this FYI this is a way foryou to do it in a privacy preservingmannerand then again the same request goes outand here you get what we were discussingearlier you get your risk analysis whereyou get a score between zero and one buthere now you have an account Defenderassessment that will tell you this is aprofile match so this is indeed buttercoming back and that you could actuallyif you want skip to FX we have highenough confidence that this is goodthis is very powerful becausehere if it was an attack perpetrated bya human or click Farmhere we capture tells you as well thatthis is actually better coming back soyou should be pretty finebut let's look at an example where thereis unusual activityum in this case one of the developerssays that I'm in the South Pole and soagain you passes that hasht account IDso let's assume that this is bettertrying to log in later onwhat you get is well this isn't indeed ahuman as expected however this issuspicious login activity going onmeaning that account Defenders modelshave detected that there is a deviationin the way they log in therefore youshould actually request a two-factorauthentication for this user becausethey're at risk of account hijacking theawesome thing about this is as you sawthis whole life so it's under 50milliseconds it's an API response so youcan ingest the attacker has no clueabout what you know so you can actuallygamify this as much as you want youcould tell them look this user doesn'texist in my database you could give thema 400 error you can give them you knowwhatever error you want you can redirectthem to a fake shop you can do honeypotsreally here it's up to you on like howyou want to build your response to theattackerso really account Defender is a powerfultool that you can add to your toolkit sothat now you're not just focusing on theBots which is a vector to an attack buton the actual nature of the attack andthe question that everybody's trying toanswer which is is this account at riskof being hijackedfor account creation it's very similarso if I'm a fraudster one two three herein this case they don't have yet ahashed account ID because they haven'tcreated the account but what werecommend our customers to do is toactually generate one on the Fly keep itso that they can earmark the account forlater and that that was important forthe next point that I'm gonna show youso again here you get a 0.8 sohighlighting is for it to be a humanhowever these humans trying to probablycreate a fake account because of thebehavior we've seen and the behaviorbehavioral signals we collect so in thiscase you have a few choices if you'rereally convinced that this is a fakeaccount you could block it if you have adoubt and you don't want to lose thosemarketing dollars you spent on thisperson you can actually block Advancedfunctionalities on your platform say forexample your streaming platform youdon't want to let them you know do livestreaming for example until they sendyou an ID Etc you can use this data inorder to you know enforce that step upoffand the reason why actually that hashtagaccount ID becomes so important isbecause you can then use theinvestigation API and that's the relatedaccounts API I was talking about earlierwhere you can actually scale for aspecific user like say a bad user forexample if you want to check their IDwhat we're going to do is actually we'regoing to return youum the cluster token and that clustertoken will allow you to actually go inthrough this groupand for that ID that we sawit will allow you to actually see all ofthe other accounts that are related toit that we think are the same owner sofor example in this case there are I'vehad the customers we were talkingthrough yesterday we had a cluster of 12000 accountsI don't know about you but I don't own12 000 accounts on any platformand you know in some cases you may havelegitimate cases for example at home youmay have a case where I may have fiveaccounts in my same house that are usingspotify or Netflixbut in this case if I have 150 accountssomething is catchy so a lot of this isactually available to you so that youcan pass it on to your manual reviewersto approve transactions you can pass iton to your data science team so thatthey can investigate Etcso really powerful tool last one that Iwanted to demonstrate real before we goto the Q a is fraud protection fraudprotection in this case is really coolbecause the basic really implementationof it is when the user clicks oncheckoutyou'll be able to pass us a little bitmore information in this case it's youknowwhat payment method are they using thecard bin which is the first six the lastfour the value the and the USD forexample the currencies USD that allowsus to build those models to understanddo attackers on this website just checkout ten dollar items because it's easierto bypass and maybe they've checked outa thousand of them or maybe in this caseyou know it's a three thousand dollaritem so it's high value so maybe we wantto make sure we check that what you getthen is is the subbot or human I'm stilla human so it's good to hearum and in this case what you get is thisscores that we saw earlier so here thescores are between zero and one againone being risky zero being low risk andin this case you know there is a lowrisk of the instrument being stolen thetransaction risk is very low your riskscore for car testing is at zero andactually because we know that thisperson with this profile in other partsof our network has not had a badbehavior we give you a high confidencescore that this person is trustworthy soyou can actually approve theirtransaction instead of maybe rejectingit so this is very cool but let's lookat actually the advanced implementationof this for a bad userforeignso in this case we have an advancedversion where you can give us a lot moreinformation right so what you do here inyour request is pass us things likeagain everything around the instrumentbeing used the address being used theuser right so for example like we verifythis email in the past or not the phonenumber the merchant data the itemsthey're trying to take out right so forexample in this case a demo item butthis could be a PlayStation 5 sneakersyou name it or for example you know adonation and then some informationaround the Gateway and what you get bygiving us that more that additional datais actually more robust scores in thiscase what we see is that the stoleninstrument verdict is is really high 70chance that this is a stolen instrumentbeing used to check outtransaction risk is actually a hundredpercent the car testing risk is at 100so there is a high likeliness that ahuman is trying cards on your page inorder to receive they can check out withthat with that card and we really don'ttrust this user there's a 10 you knowtrust score therefore you should befairly comfortable you know decliningthis um this transaction so reallypowerful tool which again in under 50milliseconds pre-auth which is veryimportant I think that's a key aspect isthis doesn't go to your paymentprocessor which means if this is if thiswould have resulted in a chargebacks youdon't have to pay that dispute fee it'stwenty dollars on average you don't haveto wait those three months lead time forthem to come back and you don't have topay the transaction fee that you pay torepayment processor which leads to evenmore losses and if you are a retaileryou're not actually losing the goodsthat you've shipped through thisattacker so really powerful tool againpre usunder 15 milliseconds and you get thoseresponses so that you can use them withthe rest of yourum workflows we've seen customers usethis for example with things like manualreviewersall right this is the end of the demoand I believe the end of thepresentation[Music]foreign"
