I don't know how Ifeel right now but it's a mix of thosetwo so thanks for coming today we'regoing to talk about API ecosystems andgenerative AI to things that are veryexciting to me my name is Todd this is agigantic picture of meumI work at Google I'm an engineerI work on a few different productsincluding apogee and applicationintegration so I'm going to be talkingabout those a bit today as wellbefore Google I worked at Twitter andMicrosoft for a long time lots ofdealing withum with apisso today's agenda like I said we'regoing to talk about API managementgenerative AItalk about what apogee does and thenwe're going to talk about what apogee isgoing to be doing there are some reallyexciting things that we're announcingthere's a very large team ofhard-workingproduct engineers and product managersand all sorts of great googlers workingon making a preview available you'regoing to be able to sign up for thatpreview today and it will be availableto trusted testers shortly I'm going todo something exciting slash nervoustoday I'm going to do some extremelylive demos and so like 50 50 it's goingto go perfectly if it doesn't it'sbecause it's extremely live I'm going totry to not use the recorded versions ofthem there's going to be some demos withapogee with duet AI we're also going tohave a demo today with chatgpt so we'rereally taking some big swings hereso first of all apis apis power digitalinteractions soyour phone has an app you're orderingcoffee you're doing a bankingtransaction you're replying to a workemail you're on your corporateenvironment you're using an internalapplication all of these are powered byapis and there's a tremendous amount ofAPI growth we've seen so this statistichere in this 201 average growth rate inapis this was as of January 2022 so wesee this continue to accelerateand building apis deploying apismanaging apis governing apis uh oopswrong direction requires a lot of loveit requires a lot of roles I've brokenthem into roughly three personas thosewho build the apis those who operate theapis and those who govern the apis I'vepersonally worked on like worn all threeof these hats and in truth there's morehats than these you'll see lots ofdiagrams online for full life cycle APImanagement and income this is lots andlots of tasks but I want to talk aboutthree particular onesso for folks who are building apistheir focus is typically to bring valueto their business to providefunctionality to their end users and inthat you need to design a good APIcontract it needs to be available in aprotocol that's useful to your to yourconsumers whether they're clientapplications or a web browserumthere's all sorts of architectarchitectures you can choose from allsorts of back-end Services you can buildyou canoop okay I went out for a second uh youcan build serverless functions you canbuild kubernetes functions everyone hasa legacy functions and services anddatabases hiding in a in a in a Cellarsomewhere in those exists and it's a lotof work to to build the apis andtypically the folks who are building theapis are not necessarily the ones whoare governing the apis so if I'mbuilding an API I want a new piece offunctionality available on my website Iwant a new piece of functionalityavailable in my app I'm not so worriedabout governance whereas the governancepeoplehave a different problem they are veryvery interested in governance andthey're less interested I think in thefunctionality they want to make surethat hey is this API properly authorizedis it properly authenticated is itproperly logged is it properly compliantwith country a b c d and e that all havedifferent regulations that change on adaily basis so there tends to beproblems when you have your peopledeveloping the apis having to keep upwith all of the governance requirementsfor your company and for regulations allover the world so you'll have yoursecure excuse me your securityadministrators your your legal teamssometimes these are all the same personand one other thing if you have apis youhave all of these stepseven if you don't staff them even if youdon't do anything about them uhso with documentation with protectingthe apis if you don't protect the apisthen your protection policy is isfree-for-all if you don't secure well Italked about secure if you're notanalyzing the apis then you know that'swhat you've decided to do so you can doall of these steps with humans you cando all of these steps with hopes anddreams or you can do all of these thingswith API management tools and softwareand processesand then last is operate soum typically people operate their apisneed to make sure that they're availableneed to scale the apis need to roll outnew versions of the software newversions of the contracts a lot of thepeople here they care about the thebusiness value the business problemthat's being solved they also care aboutnot being paged in the middle of thenightright so at two in the morning I don'twant to figure out how to scale adatabase I don't want to figure out youknow why am I getting a surge of trafficfrom this country I want tools thatfirst of all do it all automatically forme so I don't have to wake up and do itbut second of all I want tools that helpme do it when I do need to do it we'realso noticing with API growth one of thestatistics we have in here there's alarge increase in abusive traffic and soabusive traffic could be things likegigantic DDOS attacks where people spinup botnets and try to take down yourservice for bad reasons there's alsoscrapers out there who want to run theirbusiness on top of your business peoplewho want to attack your apis and getyour data or your customer data there'sa whole lot of work to do thereum let's pivot real quick to togenerative Ai and the types of problemsthat it can solve and then we'll talkabout how that applies to API ecosystemand then we'll do some exciting demosum so generative AI a lot of what we'reseeing out there is about conversationalapis you can talk to a chatbot you cantalk to Bard you can talk to chat GPTit's a pretty magical experience peopleare building apis that are powered bythings like vertex AI powered by open AIthese apis have traditional APIgovernance needs they need to beauthorized they need to be authenticatedyou're going to want to meter themyou're going to want to monetize themall of these things again if you have anAPI you have a need or you have aresponsibility to do all of these orignore theseanother thing that we're seeing inemerging area that we're going to demohere is extending llms having llmsconnected to Applications so that theycan retrieve data from exist fromreal-time databases they can get sportsscores they can tell you what theweather is going to be next week theycan book hotel rooms for you this isvery exciting in this model the newapplication is the chatbot and that iscalling the apis for you in an automatedwayanother thing we're seeing and this iswhere duet is doing a lot of work wehave automatic operators automatic AIassistants they're helping generate codefor you they're generating config foryouum they're generating dashboards for youthey're taking away a lot of theboilerplate toil that we're talkingabout and all those little bubbles inthe in the API management spaceAlso they're becoming more advanced theycan generate parts of your business asthey can create CI CD pipelines andother things the the last one the onethat's probably most exciting is someServices don't need to be writtenanymore now we can have ai be a servicein the request path rightso in this case I'll take a real easyexample let's say that you want toreturn your payload as Jason and all ofthe data is coming to you from your backend in XML there's all sorts oflibraries that do this but if thelibraries like this didn't exist youcould in theory just ask an llm heyconvert this blob from Jason to XML andit would do it for you you don't have towrite a complicated Library there arelots and lots of examples of this wherethe llm can actually be the last mileservice in your infrastructure all ofthese areare pretty exciting what we seegenerative AI doing is that for all ofthese personas build operate govern withall the subtasks analyze monetize secureauthorize you have a set of of differentpeople who have different jobs to do andthere's a gradient of skill some are newto the area they're going to have tolearn they can't do anything some arenovices and can do certain tasks someare experts and have been working on itfor years gender of AI is going to helpall of these people move up maybe morethan one level maybe multiple levels soespecially for people who are more tothe left in this diagram who don'tnecessarily know how to get started witha technology general of AI is going tohelp them get started or solve specificproblems in a compliant way and then forthe experts it's going to help automatetasks and it's going to help bring morethings togetherour hypothesis over in Google is thatwe're already seeing massive API growththat's been going on for decades I thinkthe lasttwo decades or so you've seen a lot ofespecially with the internet and thenapplication stores on the on the phonesEtc you've seen this massive growth andwe were talking about 200 percent yearover year AI is soon going to becreating apis as mashups of existingapis it's going to be discovering apisEtc but we thinkclick we think this is what's going tohappen that 200 percent is going to looka lot larger and I'm unwilling to put anumber on it because I don't knowexactly what that number would beso let's talk a little bit about APImanagement and then we'll get to somecool demos so Google has a fulllifecycle API management product it'scalled apogee uhit supports most of those functions thatyou see in the bubbles it will help youdocument apis it'll help you secure apismonetize apis authenticate apis it willdo all of these with tools instead ofhumans right so if your core competencyin your company is API management that'sgreat there's a lot of work for you todo if your core competency is buildingsoftware for your business you probablydon't want to spend lots and lots oftime doing API management tasks withwith human toil right so this is what wecall shifting down so instead of doingso there's the concept of Shifting leftdoing things earlier in your developmentcycle shifting down is reallyOutsourcing some of the requiredsteps in whatever tasks you're doing tosomebody else to software to a set oftools and that's what apogee helps doingapogee has all sorts of functionalitythat's run out of gcp and then it has adata plane that runs in your cloud ofchoice modern companies moderntechnology Stacks or multi-cloud orhybrid Cloud our hybrid multi-cloud andapogee supports all of these things it'sa variety of use cases a variety ofscale software as a service platform asa service is a is a great thing forhelping you shift down and then we havetools that support a variety ofdifferent personas so developerssecurity administratorsdata analysts like the data coming intoapogee can be made available in lookerall sorts of things to help power yourbusiness so now I'm going to talk aboutwhere apogee is goingso apogeeis investing now in tools to help youwith this explosion of apis that'scomingthis explosion of new apis is going tocreate a massive amount of toilis going to create a large amount ofrisk and interestingly enough we thinkAI is also going to help provide thetools to tame this wild sprawl of apisthat are out there so we're going totalk about a few things today in thedemos we're going to help the developersbuild with ease especially the thingsthat the developers don't necessarilywant to do that are difficult to do thatare not necessarily writing the code forthe business logic managing the supplychain understanding where the theservices live where the data livescombining these all together incompliant ways compliance is a reallybig deal especially with the amount ofregulations all over the world as theyshift and then the last one is we wantto help you protect your apis so thatyour your customers and your assets aresecuredOkay so we've approached thevery possibly live vary may not workdemo portion I'm very excited for it notnervous at allwe're going to start with a fictionalcompany Cloud9 being in company soCloud9 being so I'm from the Seattlearea they wouldn't let me talk onlyabout the Seahawks because we're in SanFrancisco so we're going to talk aboutcoffeeso they are a fictitious coffee companythat had a single location in Seattleand became popular and so now they'reexpanding they take orders fromsupermarkets and from Costco and fromall sorts of from other places this isfictitiousand they need apis to support this rightnow they're receiving all their ordersfrom phone calls and faxes they'reundergoing digital transformationthey're going to use gcp to to do all ofthese thingsumso the first problem that this companyhas is so they have a catalog of apisthey want to add new apis all of theapis have these governance concerns allof these apishave part of the API is the contractthat it provides to the application itwants to be cons when you build a newAPI you want it to be usable by yourconsumers you want it to be consistentwith your other apis you want it to becompliant with your policies so here atour company we have Shiloh who's an APIdeveloper Shiloh needs to create a newAPI it's a very good idea to design theAPI first before you implement it youwant to make sure that the API is usableby your consumers so you want to designit and you want to mock it out beforeyou actually ship it and have to supportit for the next 10 years or have tobreak compatibility by doing it soShiloh wants to design the API Shiloh isa developer so Shiloh is going to use vscode so let's go into vs codewhich I believe is here okaysoin vs code so first of all we haveapogee now available in vs code wherefor Shiloh he's able to see existingapis that are in his API catalog so thisis pulling live from from gcp datathe exciting thing we're going to do inhere is we're going to help Shilohcreate an API specthe important part about it is notjust that Shiloh is going to be able tocreate an API specification that's in aspecific format that's in open APIformat and in yaml and has all of therequired information the very excitingpart is that duet AI understands all ofthis context that's in Shiloh's existingAPI catalog it's going to hopefully inthe demo generate correct securityschemas it's going to reuse objects fromfrom his existing catalog so let's go tothe magic wand button and I'm going tosay let's acceptpurchase orders oopsI purchase orders for specializedcoffee beans through web API okayso duet is now generating this open APIspecification and we're going to diginto it in a second once it's finishedloading okay so first of all so we showthe yaml document so Shiloh is adeveloperhe is going to want to make changes tothisum he's not he's not going to want touse different tools than he's previouslyused so name API supportum we'll say coffee API supportover here we have the Swagger rendererwhich is showing the open API spec It'llpoint out any problems that are in therewe'll also be able to point out problemsin the ammo let's zoom in a little bitso some of the interesting things herethat I'll show is so there's a purchaseorder with a customer ID a purchaseorder ID there are items the items thatare in this purchase order are referringto another schema that exists already soit it points to something that's alreadyin Shiloh's inventory or in his catalogwhich is called a coffee bean which isgreat so the AI didn't have to inventa new object called a coffee bean ittook it from Shiloh's existing catalogother things is the duet AI it knowsthat Shiloh's company has the followingauthor authorization flow so it usesoauth it has two Scopes write and readand you'll see that for the variety ofapis it will say hey this one uses theread scopethis one down here uses the right scopeand it does some other interestingthings uh Shiloh's company requirespagination on certain types of apisyou'll notice when you get the purchaseordersit um the API is already paginated soit's not just an arbitrary API thatmeets open API specifications it'sactuallyfulfilling what Shiloh's companyrequires and is useful for the customersas well let's go ahead and upload thistothe apogee API Hub so purchase order APIso we're going to create this this iscalling a whole bunch of gcp apis andwe're going to view it in the API huball right so here's my API it's now aconcept API that's an open API styleit's for public users it has a supportcontact and then we can look at all theversions that were out there version onewas created just now solet's go back here so Shilohlost his Clickerbad Shilohand has to press the buttons manually soShiloh can go from idea to APIspecification in minutes in the toolsthat he's familiar with which in thiscase is vs codeum and then he can upload this to hiscatalog and he can continue working fromthereum and then obviously we're going towant to build more functionality overtime we're going to want to help Shilohmock his API and test his APIum and you ship his API and protect hisAPIum and all of these things in apogee isis very Adept at thatI really did lose the clicker sweettoo many pockets okay uh let's go toanother problem over in in Cloud9 coffeeso Emma is an integration specialist somost of the customers so far have beenfaxing in orders or emailing orders in ain a PDFand they're going to continue to do thatwhether or not they know about these newapis or or there's a new applicationavailable there's going to be some thatare going to continue to email things inso Emma wants to build an integrationso this isn't a traditional immediatereal-time API this is Emma wants tosolve a problem where when somebodyemails a purchase order form she wantsto extract all the information from thepurchase order and she wants that tothen fulfill the API where it actuallycreates a entry in the purchase orderdatabasekicks off all sorts of automations toinform the warehouse etc etc so let'ssee what Emma is going to do so uhGoogle has a product a great productcalled application integration thathelps with this it's a very no code lowcode experienceum and from this we're going to use duetAI to generatethe implementation of this API of thisproblem that Emma has automatically onher behalf and againum the idea isn't that the AI is goingto be omniscient and do everythingautomatically the AI is there to assistEmma who's still doing the work so let'stake a look at this oneokayso here we are so Emma is in the GoogleCloudexperience she's has her purchase orderAPI she's going to create an integrationand let's have her pickthis will be for creating purchaseorders and then I'll auto fill this inso automate accept orders based on anincoming PDF okay and again duet in thiscase understands the API catalog itunderstands also the databaseconnections and the business processesand apis that already exist insideCloud9sowe can confirm thisokay and this createda skeleton of an integration for Emmawhich Emma can now review so it saysokay this has a generated name does itlook good to you I'll say it doescreated a variable called a purchaseorder that seems good and then let'stake a look at what it generated it saysokay we'll trigger when we have a neworder it will get the document from theinput so this is going to be a PDFdocument and it's going to call Doc AIwhich is a gcp service which is going toextract structured information fromunstructured data so it's going toextract the purchase order informationfrom this PDFit's going to retrieve the order detailsoh it's going to put something in sap Ithink the issue here with so sap I don'tthink is necessarily the right place Ithink Cloud9 they have a bunch ofdatabases that are just named sap andnetsuite and Salesforce and other thingsthey don't say this is for purchase orthis is for purchase orders this is forcustomers so duet doesn't necessarilyknow the exact right one to pick soEmma's going to do that momentarilythen I want to calculate a delivery dateand I want to send a response to Emmathat response will probably be an emailso let's confirm the skeleton but let'sgo ahead and say that yeah sap is notnecessarily the right thing solet's say let's replace therecommendation so there's lots of apisin the catalog there's lots ofconnectors and actions that areavailable in application integrationduet knows which ones are aboutdatabases which ones are about storingdata and it knows okay if sap is not thecorrect one it could be netsuite itcould be SalesforceEmma should probably create some betternames and call them purchase orderdatabase or employee database thingslike that that would help the AI in thefuture but Emma was able to do that sonow the automation has been updatedwhere the order is created in the thenetsuite productlet's look at one other thing let's lookat how is the response being sent whatinformation are we going to email backto Emma yeah it looks like we're justtaking the order created informationand we're sending that information toEmma's output let's take a look at whatthat's doing yeah it's just sending itdirectly Emma might want to customizethe information that's going back to theto the customer and data mapping can betricky it can it can require a lot ofmanual steps and require a lot ofknowledge for for Emma in this scenarioso we're going to have duet help withthis and we're going to say hey I wantto include the delivery date so mapdelivery dates from shipment details andcalculate the total order value into theorder outputso we'll apply this modificationand duet will combine these together theorder created shipment details throw itinto the Json composer and send it tothe outputum and so duet did a lot of the work forEmma Emma is still responsible for forthe business task here so we'll confirmthis we'll go backokayso Emma had the specification fromShilohum she knew what the problem was thatshe was trying to solve related totaking PDF documents and duet was ableto help her create these Integrationsthe last oneuh is where we're going to talk aboutchat bots so llms are trained on thishuge Corpus of data and it takes a longlong time to train them so they'retypically Frozen in time so if you askChachi PT or Bardum you know what the weather is outsideor what is the stock price of yourcompany or something like that it's notnecessarily going to know there's anemerging field right now where you canactually connect llms via things calledextensions or plugins to yourapplicationis very exciting but also it's a newtype of application it requiresauthentication requires authorization itrequires all of the governance concernsthat are out there so beyond justcreating the plug-in taking your yourAPI and saying I want to expose this asa plug-in somewhere you also need it tobe properly protected you need it to beproperly governed you need it to beproperly operated so let's take a lookat how we do this so in this casethere's Billy our Solutions engineer soBilly has this uh Coffee Bean API thatexists and wants to make it accessibleto both vertex and chat GPT so vertex AIGoogle's AI product has support forextensions coming out soon I believethat's in private preview chatgptalready has this out in a public previewso we're going to look at thatand Billy wants to make sure thatsecurityauthorization logging Etc is all donecorrectlyum so and what this will do in thisscenario is make it so that on the cloudnine being coffee website they couldembed a custom chat bot that you couldtalk with and say hey what kind ofcoffee do you have I would like to ordercoffee place orders manage your ordersEtc so let's take a lookand what we'll do here we're going toinstantly make your API into an llmextensionall rightnow we pray to the demo godsokay so first we're in Chachi PT and wesayum likewhat is the temperature temperaturein Seattle today and it's going to say Idon't know because I'm an llmI don't have real-time capabilitiesincluding weather informationplease check a reliable weatherconnection okay so let's go back here toour purchase order API and this timewe're going to create an extensionso duet in this so when you create anextensionthere's a whole bunch of scaffolding youhave to put in place you have todescribe the extension to the llm sothat the llm can tune some models orsome classifiers to know when to callthe API you have to provide an open APIspecification and then you canoptionally optionally add authenticationand authorization information thatyou're definitely going to want to addso in this demo we're going to choosechat GPT and we're going to have duetautofill the information that chatgptrequires so this is going to be theCoffee Bean purchase APII'm going to call this the Coffee Beanextravaganzaumand just because it's fun in Augustokayum and duet generated this API lets youcreate and manage purchase orders forspecialized coffee beans you canpurchase therelastly we're going to say there's noauthentication required for Chachi PTto to call into this API however forusers we're going to require that theyuse Google oauththat will enable us to secure certainthings on the back end and then also ifwe choose to make this a per customeritem or if we're going to buildcustomers for it or need theirinformation then we can get it fromthere so we're going to create thisPlugin or create this extensionokay this if I saythat this generates a manifest thatchatgpt will be able to read sothe way that chat EPT and vertex handleextensions is different so I believethat the vertex model is that you uploadsomething to essentially an extensionstore chat GPT you have to go into thechat GPT UI which we're going to do in asecond and you have to point it at theManifest and then you have to updatesome tokens so we're going to do thatliveokay so this is named The Coffee BeanExtravaganza in Augustokay and it says we don't have a chatGPT token so chat GPT requires that foranything authenticated chat GPT storesuh your application secrets in its owndatabase and then gives you a Chachi BTtoken that it can use to associate withyour extension so we're gonna go getthat all right nowso first we're going to grab the name ofthe extension host we're gonna go toChachi PTand I'm going to go to the plug-in storeand I'm going to develop my own pluginokayooh error manifestthe name for human field is 31characters long okay we're going to gobackand we arenot going to call this extravaganzaokayCoffee Bean purchase API that soundsgreat okay so we're going to create thisoh oh I didn't add authentication to ityou can see that it's not thereokay now we're going to secure it withapogee and Google oauthokay now it needs the chat GPT tokenokay we're going to try this againdevelop my own pluginhey okay so it's the Coffee Beanpurchase API and now it needs the oauthcredentials for my applicationso I'm going to go back over here andI'm going to copy the client ID and I'mgoing to give it to chat GPT I'm goingto say here's the client ID I need togive it a secretand I'm going to copy the secret and putit in herewe go nextokay chat GPT is storing this in theirback end and they've generated a tokenthat I can now use and store in mymanifestso and they say my open API my open AItoken is this stringI'm going to input that in my extensionI'm going to save it to the Manifestokayumit's now going to show up in here yeahhere's the open AI token so now all theall of the toil has been done for me andit's secured let's go back to chat GPTsee if I did that right yep okay do Iwant to install this sure why notokay open a open AI has embedded theplug-in that's okayokay it says hey you need to log in youwill be redirected to the coffee beanspurchase API to log in log in with thepurchase API okay so this is doingGoogle oauth for meI'm already logged in with Google oauthso it's probably not going to show thescreen okay so it says I have thisinstalled now let'ssee if see how Chachi PT and the pluginwork together let's make this larger uhwhat types of coffee are availableokaychat GPT is thinkingoh it's saying I'm using the Coffee Beanpurchase API which is an unverifiedpluginit's calling that and it's saying hereare the types of coffee beans availableArabica and Robusta and here's what theyare and let's take a look at whatchatgpt actually did so it used thispluginand here it says it called the listcoffee beans APIand it said it requested a page of onewith at most ten right because this is apagination required API and here's theresponse in chat GPT made it very nicefor meumlet's see how powerful these chat Botsare with apis and if they can do newthings let's say I want to order15 units of the dark bitter coffeeokaychat EPT is usingthis again it says your order's beenplaced it ordered the Robusta coffeewhich is from Vietnam it's dark andbetter and it costs 67.50 and if we lookhereit used the create purchase order APIthat we designed earlier it says I wantto order 15 of them the Coffee Bean IDis two it figured out based on theinformation that I received from thecoffee from the list coffee beans itemwhich one corresponded to dark bitter etcetera et cetera it created order onetwo three four five its status ispending Etc et cetera so this is a newapplication a new chat bot that I didn'thave to create all I had to do was givean API to Chachi PT to vertex AIconfigure it appropriately and I want tomake sure it's governed so I have apogeecontrolling all of these thingsstill no clicker ohgood newsthe clicker has been locatednow the the very last issue that'shappeningum over at Cloud9 mean is they'rebecoming extremely extremely popularum and now they're being attackedthey're being attacked because somebodybad wants to knock their site offlinesomebody wants to place a whole bunch oforders and then cancel the orders andcause all sorts of churn and problemsfor the company someone's just trying todo research so the Amari the securityexpert at Cloud9 has noticed that thethe new apis are under attacksowhat we have here is Google so alsousing Ai and ml this is more traditionalAi and ml pattern recognition Google asit turns out gets lots and lots oftraffic Google has lots and lots of apiswe have sites like YouTube and Gmail andGoogle searchthe millions and billions and trillionsof API calls that have happened toGoogle have had many attacks in them andthousands of Engineers at Google havebuilt models and built software that candetect and shield apis from the attacksso what we've done in apogee is we havea product called apogee Advanced APIsecurity which uses these models fromGoogle level traffic dataum it creates ml models for these and itwill identify that the traffic that'scoming through your apigee services doesit correspond to any of these types ofattack patterns that Google has seen inthe past and this is something that'savailable now and it's something thatwe're continuing to work on over time togive more capabilities to it and to alsocustomize it for for your product alsowe don't take any of the traffic datathat you are receiving that's goingthrough apogee and we don't use that totrain any of Google models we don't usethat to train any customer models it'sall your data is your data which is alsothe case by the way for all of the duetdemos that we're showing here nothing isshared back to to use for trainingGoogle models nothing is used for othercustomers your data is your dataum and the big message to take away fromthis isyour engineering team your legal teamyour security teamis typically a fixed size and it takes along time to hire people it takes a longtime to ramp people upum you have a responsibility with all ofyour apis to do something for all ofthese tasks on the Wheeland you have three choices you canfulfill these tasks using humans you cannot fulfill the tasks and hope certainthings don't go wrong or you can shiftdown and you can push the responsibilityonto the platform you're running on andso Google is investing very heavily inproviding tools that do this in anautomatic way for you in a highlypersonalized contextual way using yourEnterprise data in a secure and privateway where it doesn't go back to Googleso for all of the demos that I showedyou they're all going to be available totrusted testers trusted tester programwe want your feedback we want to hearhey this works great for us or hey thisis not working or we want somethingdifferent or we want more functionalityso if you get in the trusted testerprogram we're going to want feedbackwe're going to want to work with you soI'm going to thank you in advance forfor signing up and then for joining thatprogram[Music]thank you"
