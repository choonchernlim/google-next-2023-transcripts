introduced AI based rankingin the results so instead of justshowing you results that include thekeywords we actually also show you theshow you results but based on what youactually meantso that's

favorite is muting where Ican use it to mute a social spaceso that I can pay attention to thethings that are most important to methat I need to get work done right nowbut when I have a moment I'm able tofind also the spaces that don't alwaysend up you know bumping up to the top ofthe message streamfor this next section let me inviteratchet over to tell you all aboutcollaboration in chat[Applause]thank you OMSIum I'm excited to chat aboutumteam collaboration in chat as bamshishowed the video in which chat is theplace where teamwork gets donenow uh when it comes to teamcollaboration spaces are very effectivetools of helping users get various typesof tasks done with whether it's you knowactive collaboration in the moment orit's project planning which is a littlebit more long-term sharing importantnews with the organization or evenhandlingurgent situations you know as Mitch whois one of our customers you'll hear fromhim a little bit later has shared howteams at Colgate use spaces spaces areused throughout the organization forteams to coordinate and shareinformation or manage developingsituationstoday we are upgrading spaces with a lotof useful functionalities which willmake it a place for teams to get theirbest work donestarting with the first onefew weeks ago we announced that we areincreasing the space membership from 8000 members to 50 000 memberstoday we are announcing even furtherincrease by 10 x which means spaces willnow be able to host 500 000 members inthemthis removes any barrier ofcommunication and collaboration acrosslargest of our organizationsso you could basically host the entirecompany in a single space and use thateffectively to communicateearlier this year we also launchedbroadcast only spacesbroadcast only spaces are used byleaders to communicate important newsupdates or information with theirrespective teamsthis week we are making broadcast onlyspaces even more usefulnow users can respond to those updatesin linethis will keep the space organized butprovide an opportunity to build aculture in the organization throughreactions through inline responses forimportant updatesbesides that we are also adding quickquick analytics called message viewsthat will help you understand as aleader how many users have read thatparticular post and that's all going tohappen in real timethis is a big one we are bringinghurt many timeson you know solving problems you knowbuilding a plan you want to switchquickly to a ad hoc get together over avideo callnow we are providing this ability tostart a hurdle from within a spacethrough a single click action so thatyou can basically have activecollaboration with your colleagueswithout switching out of chatthis can also be usedfor all-day drop-in meetings where youcan catch up with what's happening rightnow at the time that you are comfortablein hybrid world this is a superpowerbecause now if two of your colleaguesare working remotely while rest of theteam is in one particular location youcan use these all-day drop-in meetingsto collaborate togetherthis is a feature thatasked uschat is evolving from a text-basedcommunication appsomething that supports multimediamodalities as well so if you have a lotto say but you don't have enough timesend an audio snippetcontinuing this Firepower of updatesthat we are bringing to spaces for allof youwe also understand that customers usemulti-environment multi-platformenvironments across their teamsso we have partnered with Mio tobasically bring message levelinteroperability with othercommunication platforms like slack teamsEtcthis is available in beta as ofyesterday and will be available forGeneral usage early next year[Applause]nowwhile collaboration happens a lot inspaces nowadays integration and apps areessential part of how get work gets doneso we are going to share a bunch ofupdateswhich help not only teams make it easyto find new applications but also tobuild them with AI powered no codedevelopmentthis is exciting with the new duet AI inapp sheet users can now use Simpleconversational prompts to build an appand Deploy on web and mobileseamlesslyand guess what no code needs to bewritten to build this appchat is already full with manythird-party Integrationslike GitHub jeera Asana pager Duty whichbasically helps through variousworkflows during the daywe are excited to announce that reallyreally useful apps like workday Zoho lowmaps are also coming to trackwith this we are also making ituh with this we are also making it easyto access these apps by introducing adedicated app section in the messagerosternow when a team needs a particular appthey have to find it and now we arebringing all chat apps to workspaceMarketplace which will make it very easyto find apps that work with chatat the same time a user would be able tobrowse workspace Marketplace from withinchatand then through some easy simple clickswould be able to install the app in inthe in the chat appI'm guessing most of youif you're using workspace already usethe Google Drive appthis is very popular app amongst ourusers as it helps users to get notifiedabout you know access requests commentsin their documentswe are updating this app to bring twonew powerful functionalities in whichyou can actually respond to thosecomments from this app itselfand at the same time you can add mentionyour teammates whose attention is neededfor that particular discussionthis would help users get more of theirwork done in chatwe really hope that with all theseupdates to spaces apps and then mycolleague Anton who's just about to comeon the stage would talk aboutIntegrations we have really created agreat place for best of the teamwork toget done in chat with that I'll handover to Antonhi everyone thanks Richardwe'll see if I know how to drive this Imean to talk about Chad as the center ofthe workspace for where collaborationhappens across the boardI'll start with a quote from Rhys who'sgoing to be joining for the panel laterand he says one of the strengths of chatis integration with workspace being ableto assign tasks to space members thatappear in their Google Calendar with adeadline reminder launching a quick callwithin uh Google meet and receiving thedrive notifications in chat to reduceemail clutter all great examples of waysthat chat allows us to focus our energyon being more productivemy personal favorite is just before andjust after a meeting Chad actuallyprompts you with a chat message right inthe product to allow you to talk to allthe people who are going to be in thatmeetingtoday we're excited to share many of thenew features that are building in chatand are extending this integratedapproachGoogle Groups is already something thatmany companies use and it's a realstaple for how you manage teams and andcollaboration organization by populardemand we're going to be adding supportin Google chart and so you can sync anyspace with the Google group and aspeople are added and removed from thatgroup they'll automatically be added andremoved for the space as well there'lljust be one waythere's just the first step we're goingto add a lot more things that will youknow like link more to the space and andhelp all the the team collaborationhappen once bornfor those of you who are heavy docsusers and have been using smart canvasyou're probably really appreciating howit's transformed docs sheets and slideswe're excited to bring the samefunctionality into chat so just like youcan mention any person you'll be able toeasily refer to any of your files withinworkspace and they're going to getupgraded with a better treatment and aneasier way to see them in chatfor admins workspace admins already havea unified console where they're able tomanage everything in one spotsome of the things we've added this yearare better tools to manage spaces betterways to have visibility into theconversations bulk delete inactivespaces and just generally manage howchat is used in their organizationas we're continuing to support largerand larger groups like 500 000 peopleit's more important than ever to havethe ability for Community managers tomoderate where things are we're addingmore capabilities within Chad for usersto reportpotentially offensive or inappropriatecontent and then the moderators will beable to manage that at themselvessimile as part of all workspace chatusers enjoy the same buildingprotections that keep workspace safe andsecure whether zero trust security modelthe real-time data loss protection orthe general phishing and malwareprotections it's automatically availablein chartthat was just a peak of some of the 40features that we've been uh like welaunched more than that this year butthose are the ones we've talked abouttodayand uh with that we're continuing ourjourney to make chat the best place forpeople to connect collaborate and createwith that I'll bring vancey back and Ithink he's going to introduce the panel[Applause]yeah so next now let's hear from ourcustomersum pleased to welcome Reesechange an adoption leaderfor the digital we're expanded AirbusMitch Cohen director of collaboration atColgate and Jason Catu tsar of it atmendesta[Applause]thank you Rhys Mitch and Jason forjoining us we really appreciate youbeing hereso Reese can you start us off bynow where chat has the most impact inyour organizationyeahum I mean chat is something that uh thatuh at Airbus is something we didn't havebefore we moved to Google workspace wedidn't have any kind of uh any kind ofEnterprise tool for for chat we had uh asoft phone tool which had some instantmessaging capabilities but but nothingmore than that and it's really uh had ahuge impact on changing the way we wework at Airbus particularly changing theway that we collaborate so uh bringingsome of those conversations that used tobe an email directly into chat uh thatspeeds things upum and there's also some conversationswhich just don't work with email rightthe the kind of the the asynchronousapproach uh works for for some types ofconversations and not others so thosetypical uh fast-paced conversationswhere several people reply at the sametime when the and the the responses getcrossed over at email you don't get thatissue in chat so this is a big help forus I thinkuh something else that I reallyappreciate about chat is uh um the waythat you can use it from any device wecould do that via email as well ofcourse but it's it's I think that we'vegot a culture of people being used tousing uh chat and instant messaging appsin their personal life and thereforemore and more they're comfortable doingthis in their professional life so sothis is changing thingsum and a big benefit for us is the waythat it's actually allowing us to bringpeople together so Airbus is a companythat makes pretty Innovative products wemake things that fly planes helicopterssatellites rockets and that means we'vegot a lot of smart people and the thingwith smart people is that they oftenhave lots of other skills and talentsand interests outside of what we'veemployed them to do and so you mighthave a community adapters of say pythoncoders but that might be people infinance in HR in engineering they mightnot be in a team together and they mightnot be able to find each other but theybenefit from finding each other so whatGoogle Chat is allowing us to do nowparticularly with the ability to browseI was public spaces and just self-join aspace it's empowering our users to buildcommunities find each other and cometogether for the greater good of Airbusand just to give some statistics we'vegot more than seven million chatconversations at Airbus that's a mix ofuh one-to-one messages group chats andspaces uh created over the last fiveyears around 200 000 people so we canreally see that it's being adopted quiteheavilyMitch what about a Colgateso you know Chad's really become acritical one-on-one you know tool for usit's used one-on-one and used in groupswe have a very long history of actuallyyou know having a chat application andpeople chatting one-on-one but I thinkit's really the groups and the spacesthat is really taking chat you know andmaking it even more impactful for us wesee you know a lot of teams have builtspaces for themselves a lot of you knowhybrid groups like Reese mentioned havecreated spaces for themselves you knowthe the ease and ability to say I'mchatting you know we're not gettingthrough let's jump into a meeting rightjust one click right into meet fromthere and then we're starting to seeother use cases for chat emerge so wehave a group that had a big off-sitemeeting they used to develop anapplication separate for to run themeeting they said oh with chat withDrive integration file integration chatum tasks we can do that all right inchat so they built the Space and managetheir meeting right there and then youknow the broadcast bases it's you knowwe're starting to use them now and wethink that be a big part of ourcommunication strategy and then I thinkbeyond all the work that gets done wesee a lot of team building you know wesee a lot of celebrations birthdaysanniversaries accomplishments familiesyou know being shared in chat spacesthat just get people to know each otherbetter and and be friends and it helpsget work done as wellJasonyeah for for us the the big thing is thethat rich integration we have betweenchat and our calendars you know as asReese mentionedum and I think Anton mentioned you knowthat that Dynamic chat that starts upjust beforeum a meeting uh is scheduled or evenwriting calendar the ability to click onyour calendar event and say I need to doa chat with everybody who's coming up tothis challenge calendar event it's meantthat the discussions before and afterthe meetings don't miss important peopleuh from from the meeting sharingdocuments all of that intensecollaboration we're not missing anybodyand there's none of those oh we forgotyou when we did the distribution listhere's all the stuff you know they'reyou're just not missing anybody it'samazingum yeah it's that integration it's beenexcellent yeah thanks for sharing thatJason so we really love to hear how Chadcan bring the best of work spacetogether do our users with such seamlessintegration so we've announced over 40plus features today which one of theseare your favorites Jason why don't westart with youwell it's uh it's been an amazing weekand I think my answer is going to changesince the last time you asked me thisthe the duet integration uh the no codeapps the ability to build custom appsum for our individual business casesright into chat where we already haveeverybody interactingum that has inspired our developmentgroups that's what they're reallyexcited about right now but you knowfor me I'm an administrator at heart thetwo-way sync for with Google Groups it'sit's really going to be powerful for usthat's great to hear Mitchso pick up right where Jason left offand the group sinkeverything's in groups right every everyteam as a group we have distributionlist that's going to be a huge help ingetting people in and being able to spinup spaces more easily for targetedaudience love the idea of how you'reredesigning the chat app you know Ithink so much traffic goes into chatthese days giving people the ability tomore quickly see what needs theirattention who's waiting on a responsewhere they've been mentioned I thinkthat's really just going to help peoplecome in focus and and and and keepthings moving at work uh the you know wethink mentioned this earlier already butthe large moderated chat spaces and allthe improvements there I think thatreally just becomes part of our you knowcommunication strategy and my personalfavorite the Drive app love that you'reupdating it it is great for you knowtill now being able to use it you knowpeople ask for access to a document youcould be walking down the streets of SanFrancisco in one click give them thataccess and not have to be at your deskand and you know extending that intocommenting and into other features isjust going to make it that much morepowerful andlove it I use the Drive app every minutepretty much literally what about youRhys what do you think people at Airbusare going to love about the new updatewell just as a site I don't have anyemails coming from Google Drive anymoreI mean I only use the Drive app and I'msomeone who uh I'm not someone who'sable to control my inbox so having thatdrive app is super usefulum yeah well let's complete the HolyTrinity uh I'm gonna also talk aboutGoogle Groups uh synchronization and Ipromise we wouldn't we want that page tosay that but I know that uh are you ahokay I'll follow up on thatwe'll take care of it but I mean I knowthat those are your two products familyso you have some stake thereum uh but it's honestly it's been a bitpainful for us we heavily rely on GoogleGroups for managing access to Shareddrives and shared calendars and it hasso it's had so much potential to to justsay oh a new team member joins you addthem to the group they have everythingbut they still had an extra step to jointhe chat space and when they left theteam you had to manually remove themfrom the chat space so having this fixedfinally is something I think we're veryhappy about the admin space also but I'mnot a system administrator so actuallymy interest there for the admin consolepart is actually around kpis so I'mresponsible for for change in adoptionand so I'm interested in actually beingable to pull data about the adoption ofour chat spaces and at the moment we cando that kind of by pulling someinformation out of the bigquery logshaving something a bit more centralizedin the admin console is going to makethat a lot easier for usthe smart home feedmany of us at Airbus fully Embrace chatand there are some of us who would quitehappily ditch email and just use chatbut there are some people who struggle abit and find that there's too manymessages too many notifications too manyspaces they don't know where to startsomeone came to me the other day andthey had like 12 spaces and said I'vegot so many spaces 12 is too many so noteveryone in the same way and I thinkhaving the smart home feed that you'veannounced this morning is going toreally help that having uh like a sortof an inbox for chat which is sort of aparallel to what they're more used to inthe email world I think that's reallygoing to help and I guess I have tofinish by mentioning huddlesum uh which uh I think is somethingthat's going to be super useful wealready see that the meat callingfeature has been uh very useful since itwas launched and it's kind of a sort ofan equivalent in a group environment uhhaving that option to just jump into itinto a meeting without having to leavethe chat space I I can really see thatour users are going to find this uhreally helpful in their day-to-day workRhys Mitch and Jason thank you so muchfor your time really appreciate youbeing here it's a pleasure talking toyou here[Applause]so as we're getting closer to the end ifwe I think we have a couple of minutesso please do line up and see if you haveany
