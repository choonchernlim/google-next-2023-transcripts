    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good morning everyone and Welcome to ourpanel discussion on AI and the changingworkplace I'm Quentin Hardy I'm the headof editorial at Google cloud and in justa moment you'll be hearing fromChristina Barr uh vice president of duetAI at Google workspace and Trisha DavisMuffet senior director of customermarketing at Google workspace both ourguests have extensive experience in thetechnical business and personaldimensions of both collaborativeworkplace tools and artificialintelligence including Generalartificial intelligence which has beenrather a subject of the past few daysand we'll be drawing on that to discussthe essential opportunities necessaryskills and professional concernsassociated with bringing thisrevolutionary technology into theworkplace we don't have a super fullroom even though the session was soldout you get a little Third Day drop offso we may just turn it into a little bitof a conversation with the audience weknow next draws a lot of brilliant andengaged people and so I'm going toinclude plenty of time for audiencequestions maybe when he wants afive-minute AI makeover these are yourpeoplelet's beginlet me set the stage by asking thisquestionhow many people here I think a few ofyou certainly me remember a life beforethe internethow very good wowmy peoplelife before mobile devices yesnowwho can imagineworking and going back to that worldnobody gets to raise their hand ifthey've checked their smartphone in thelast 15 minutesit's an essential part of life andthat's the point the point here is notwhether life is better or worse becauseof this technology though I think it'sbetter overall and I'm sure most of youdo but the great Technologies veryquickly become essential in work andlife one can't realistically imagine aworld that moves forward withoutsmartphones online life computation on alarge scale I mean the same way youcan't imagine life without radio or filmor Refrigeration both of today's guestsbelieve as I do that we arein a moment of very rich opportunity oneof those rare moments when a newtechnology in this case Ai andspecifically gen AI is becoming thatkind of an essential technology and in avery short time not many years it willbe hard to imagine a world where you arenot working with it and encountering iton a regular basisthe key reasonis that AI enables an exceptionallynatural and effortless interactionbetween people and machines so that theycan request complex personal computationwhether in communicating or planning orcreating or a host of other activitiesand have answers back in moments it'salmost as ifyou know over the past 70 years or sothe distance between computers andpeople has grown closer and closer thatpeople had to act like computersoriginally wiring them and theninteracting and acting results or ordoing Punch Cards where every singlehole had to be exactly right butcomputers got a little faster and alittle better and they were able to acta little bit more in a peoplely way youknow where you could have a command lineor then object oriented or pull down andof course online and htl tml made thatdistance even closer and nowit's like talking I wouldn't say exactlywith a human but like with an objectthat carries out tasks and responds in anatural way and at every stage therehave been more developers there has beenmore computation there's no reason tothink there won't be a new explosion ofdevelopers in all sorts of ways andcontexts while computersdirectly generate novel insights askquestions create new media experiencealongside with people using creativityon whole new levels we were talkingabout this just beforehand these arevery far-reaching implications perhapsnowhere more than in the workplace andeven in these early days we're seeingnew and more effective ways to reachclients to serve customers to organizework to write quicker to classify anduse information better much else besideswhich is not bad considering this wholething got rolling like last Octoberpretty good so to be this early on thecurve of a new and essential technologyis a great opportunity it's our chanceto think about Ai and how it will changethe nature of work and collaborationwhat new skills may become essentialwhere companies will move quickly andwhere they may struggle and how thiswill affect areas of business likesecurity regulation or privacyPerfection protection and that'senough out of me let's turn to ourpanelists for some information and toyou as well for some ideas perhaps orsome sharp questions that you wish topush them nothing is out of bounds wellum soum Christina I mispronounced your nameit's bear I apologize did catch it butuh I want to start by asking both of youum just talk a little bit about yourbackground and how that background whatyou've been doing for many years affectsthe way you see AI coming into theworkplacesure I'll start um so I've been intechnology marketing for many years fordecades uh and from before before theinternet before or sort of at the earlydays of the internetum for mobile devicesum and so I've seen a lot of shiftsright and I've seen a lot I've beeninvolved in helping bring a lot of thoseshifts to Marketum interestingly I I got into technologymarketing it was not my first choice ofcareer I I was originally going to be anEnglish professor and uh I'm a poet uhand I still am a poet but um and Idecided I like to you know do thingslike pay rent and eat food and so Ithought maybe I would get a job writinguh in marketing so it really was fromum that place of being good at writingand communicating and being able to dothat and that's what brought me intomarketing and soum it I have to admit that I was alittle resistant about having somethingelse help right since that's a very corething to me and I've been reallyinterested to see this and and have alot of you know perspective on that sodo you feel threatened I I don't feelthreatened now that I've used it I didfeel threatened when I didn't but Ihadn't tried it yet but I don't feelthreatenedum anymore do you use it I do I use itas a tool what do you do with it uh wellso I use it for a lot of email responsesI use a lot of routine communication orto get started on things where I need topull a lot of information together I'mnot great at I mean I I don't like gosifting through things and pullingthings from here and there to getstarted what I like is the sort of thepart that really is human creativityright the part where I'm trying toemotionally connect so the more time Ican spend doing that part rather thanall the pieces of like pulling stuffstuff together and have the rightinformation and pull it into bring it tobullet points and make it if it in theright number of you know words all thosethings those are things that I canabsolutely use duet with you know withwith my own writing to make it fasterfor me to get something done that'sthat's up to my standards there's agreat line in the business you can editanything except a blank page exactly itgets you started and you just make itbetter yeah and I also I use it forwriting and I'll write a piece and thenI'll put up a prompt that is the sametheme and see what it does and it's likea first editor it helps me see if Imissed anything you know is there partof this argument that I can then Portover into mine and so it's kind of it'slike a first assistant yeah butChristine yeah soum I'm I'm currently the vice presidentof product inside of workspaceresponsible for drive and our editorsproducts um so that includes docs sheetsslides and of course the investment thatwe're making in Duet Ai and generativeAI in thoseum and you know to me this is a labor oflove right I think there are there isdrudgery in the world of productivitythat we all face right whether that iskeeping on top of our massive inboxesand trying to produce decks and and andand and docs in in an efficient way andunlike Trisha you know like mybackground is engineering right like I'mnot a writer but he starts withimagination so the fact that I can likewrite out a couple of thoughts uh anduse the web AI to write completesentences and make me seem moreprofessional is is not only aproductivity booster but it also I thinkit just helps me beum you know punch above my weight classbasically right it's like how do I lookbetterum the other the other one is um youknow we do we we do a lot ofpresentations internally and I'm alsonot an artist right and so the fact thatI can just enter in a couple of promptsvery simply and then get these highresolution very customized images thatreally hammer on the specific point thatI want to make like that is amazingright because now we are we're takingsort of like the things that we don'tlove about our our jobs and and how waysto make us more efficient and then asTrisha mentioned we can pour all of thatintoum you know connecting with our ourteammates in order to produce cool stuffyeah so it's you know itthis is all the history of automationthis is all the history of improvingproductivity that goes back to theAbacus you know how can I make this amore productive experience andcreativity also involves productivitylike you get through you you get you gotto grind through that talk about that inthe context of software development yeahhow do you see that happening yeah so Imean in in our world the way that wethink about this is um we we wallow anddeeply study the way that people areusing our existing products right so howare you using docs how are you usingslides like what are these what we callinternally these critical user Journeysand how can technology be applied tomake those critical user Journeysright more efficient how do we improvecustomer satisfactionum and what I love about this um thisnew era that we're in is like there'sjust been such an explosion ofcapabilities like the image generationmodels coming out from Google like theyare jaw-droppingly good right and so thethe fact that I get I get to be I get towork alongside some of like the bestresearchers and and the best productdevelopers in the in the world in orderto incorporate those those Technologiesdirectly into applications like whatlike what we have in workspace it's veryhumbling and alsoum uh like very rewarding to see howquickly we can bring things to Marketjust because of the structural setup ofGoogle so yeah I think for us in inproduct development and product buildingit's really focusing on the user we talka lot about user love we talk a lotabout what people are trying to do andthen and then build towards thatany big changeanything new tool also results in a kindoforganizational change you know when youhad mainframes you had operationsresearch you had these big verticalcompanies lots of subdivisions andalmost like files that people you knowsort out in roles that were veryspecifically designed you get the clientserver and it's a little more fluid it'slike an open plan office people aresharing information moreduring the pandemic it was an onlineworld with a lot of video and much lessformal and we're still working throughwhat that's going to mean but let's talka little bit about how you thinkgenerative AI will change roles in theworkplace and how much change managementpeople encounter and maybe offer peoplea few tips on how to get ahead of thathow to learn and start thinking aboutorganizing in new ways yeah I I think itcan be very daunting for people whenthey see this capability appear or whenthey know that it's it's coming in theirtechnologyand I think it's really important tothink about the fact thatum you know the general AI capabilitiesthat we're bringing to Market you knowthe I loved the way that Thomas framedit in the keynote which was vertex isfor Builders and duets for users and soI think once you think about that whenyou think okay I now have access to thismodel I don't have to really understandwhat's going on with the model I haveaccess to it and I can actually engagewith it in the way that I was you knowworking previously so I think first itwas getting over just the the fear ofusing it and I and I think makeespecially for leaders and organizationssort of pushing folks to say did you tryit this way did you how much did you useit could you have done it you know couldyou have used this to organize could youhave used this to come up with you knowadditional mood boards for that campaigncould you have you know come up withmultiple variations on that copy right Ithink there's going to need to be someof that prompting and pushing withinorganizations and then also I thinkwe'll have to probably rebuild a littlebit of muscle of the the level ofgranularity that people go to on reviewof things becauseI'm sure there will be people who get alittle sloppy with it and sort of arelike well you know I got that draft doneso I'm going to push it along wheresomebody who might have been sort ofjust doing the creation of the firstdraft and expecting others to review nowthat person can actually take it to thenext level themselves and so I thinkpeople you know sort of learning thatand taking on that responsibility of thesecond third fourth draft themselvesbefore taking it on for further reviewyeah this changes everything doesn'tmean everything has to change rightthose don't swap around and how peoplelearn can take place in very kind ofindividual ways inside the organizationand then share that learning and I I wasspeaking with the CIO at U.S steelyesterday and they've actually started agen AI project with us and it's aroundthe maintenance of trucks inside ironore mines you know it's not everythingchanging all at once but in that onesection they see that as a good startingpoint to think about the process oflearning and repair and they thinkthey'll shut shorten the time of repairsby 40 so super good metric you know notgoing to tear everything apart to startthey're going to be a lot of learningthey can share that you then apply totraining people elsewhere or helpingthem get answers elsewhere it's a niceexample how do you see change happeningwith thisI I mean when as you were talking I wasjust kind of reflecting about like howthe culture in in our teams have evolvedwith withum us using generative AI on a dailybasis and like in a lot of ways is ithas brought fun back into work rightlike we have everything from like thegoofy images that people will insertinto slide decks I feel like we are kindof like returning back to this like verygoogly like playful approach to thingsso like so as an example you know wewere we did like a little contest of whocan summarize a you know an hour-longpresentation the fastest in the most funway and so you know like oh and you onlyhave five minutes to do it right so likehow do you take a transcript summarizeit and then turn it into a haiku rightor make it like a like a pirate rightand I think like that type ofapplication of generative AI is has beenlike so fun for us in the way that we'readapting itwell it also makes those uh like Iremember I was in that meeting where wewere doing that and it's like oh soum well first I would have to watch thathour-long video oh no wait I don't haveto do that you I think there's some ofthat just like getting over the what youexpect and you hear the task you're likewell that's impossible what you'retelling me to do yeah I can't I couldnever do that and then you realize noit's actually not impossible and I thinkthat helped open certainly open my eyesabout okay tasks that I might havethought were impossible to accomplish onthe timeline I was given I need torethink that yeah exactly exactly andand I'll share one of the examples thata customer shared with us yesterdayum the um a VP from Adore Me one one ofour trusted tester customers was sayingthat they they rolled it out to a bunchof different functions across theircompany and one of them is theircopywriters so they are a direct toconsumer product business and they haveum typically you know written productdescription for a ton of differentthings and the copywriters I think atfirst are like you know maybepotentially threatened by this idea oflike using generative AI to do this butthen once they realize how much timethat frees them up to go work on highervalue things like that like writingthese product descriptions and trying tobe creative every month is like notactually that fun right so like how canyou think about applying those higherlevel skills to these bigger marketingcampaigns to these like higher valueinitiativesI'm going to use that as a jumping offplace and in the interest of efficiencyum spare someone asking the questionwe're going to get which is is thistaking people's jobsI don't think so I I think it's actuallyum it's actually going to help peopleget more done faster and it is aninteresting studyum that an academic researcher did aboutit was about copywriting and it waslooking at the increases in productivityfor people across some from very Juniorto very senior more accomplished folksand the folks at the top who werealready very accomplished got maybe 1015 percent better on their by usinggenerative AI but the folks who werejust learning who were sort of at thebottom became 50 60 percent moreeffective so it took people who werereally struggling and made them good andit took the people who were alreadyreally good and made them a littlebetter and so like to bring your entireorganization up and to have peoplelearning from something that it doesn'thave to be humans constantly iteratingwith each other and to be able to learna significant portion of that yourself Ithink is a as a game changer and willhelp people move forward in theircareers faster yeah I I feel the sameway right I think it duet AI is athought partner and a coach right notnot a replacement and so you know likethe the way that I think about it islike we went from like you have a hammerand then you had a nail gun and then youhad a laser guided nail gun right but itdoesn't sort of supplant the human thatneeds to build something right it's justlike the tools get more advanced overtime well yeah let me tweak that andmaybe answer the question yeah maybe itis going to eliminate jobs in some waysbut it's not going to eliminate the needfor human creativity absolutely you knowit's very interesting we're having thisdiscussion around all jobs are goingaway when unemployment is like threepercent you know but and there's no signof it happening which is interesting butI think and I think you agree thatcreativity happens inside every jobbasically you know if you don't believeme watch a white person work for ahigher tip they are reading the personthey are reading the table they arethinking about what they need they areworking the whole time and that's a youknow and you can see expressions of thatin almost any kind of Labor you knowactually the fact that you say thattrigger something for me like I I 100 Ifeel the same way and I feel thatsometimes engineering kind of gets a badrap for not being creative right likethe art the liberal arts is where you goto be creative and then stem is for likeyou know the logical nerds right an as alogical nerd like I mean this is whatproblem solving is right and like thecreativity that you need to apply butyou see some code that makes you sad andthen you see other code where you thinkthis person is clever this is a thing ofbeauty exactly right you know so I Idon't take away from either one yeahexactly you know there also is anotherother interesting thing that came fromsome of our customers who were in TheTrusted tester program who were workingglobally and had folks in in all sortsof international locations who were alloperating in the common language ofEnglish when they were talking betweencountries and a surprising finding thatwe had was that it actually helped drawout folks who were not native speakersof English who were sort of resistreluctant to share their ideaspreviously or it would take them a longtime to get that polish to the levelthat they wanted it to be and you knowwith using the duet in their in theiremail Communications and their writingthey were able to level that playingfield and bring more ideas out fromfolks who had really sort of hung back alittle bit because they were worriedabout being able to communicateeffectively and it's going to changethings for managers a little bit interms ofexpectations and bringing people alonggetting teams together and in thatSpirit ofwe're making thingseasier and we're encouraging creativitybut we're not making lifeProblem freewhat problems do you think this willease for managers and let's get realhere what new challenges might thiscreateto go for itso I think it'll it'll ease I think itwill ease some of those impossibledeadline challenges right like we canmove faster on things and you can have aperson own more of the the projectthemselves without having to alwaysbring in a lot of people at thebeginning of a project I think the theone of the problems and things thatpeople have to watch is we can't be lazyabout review right so if a lot ofcontent is getting createdum then we actually have to have asharper eye on the review of things onthe questions we ask we have to thinkmore deeply about why something is beingdone push it to the next level becauseit'll be easy to get a lot of contentcreated so we can't get lazy about justoh yeah that's good enough let's Push ItForward right we'll have to have alittle bit more Precision on thosereview Cycles well that means bettercustomer Focus yeah you know which isnot a bad thing right yeah I think whatI'm most excited about isum accelerating people's ramp time rightand and as they're on boarding so one ofthe big Investments that we're making inDuet AI is that helping it understandsort of your Corpus you know your what'sin your Gmail what's in your your driveand your organization's um sort of likeoverall fileum storageum and so like why this is important isum there's just so much institutionalknowledge that's like locked up inslides or in various different documentsand when um and because of the way thatwe've architected all of this with in avery like privacy forward way we knowwho has access to what files so youimagine you started a new company rightand your your provision access tovarious different you know documentslike company strategy etc etc and beingable to ask duet AI like what's asummary of of XYZ project or you knowthis kind of thing so you kind of likeremove sort of like that embarrassingFactor when you're new and you have togo ask a colleague and explain somerandom acronym and I think that level ofcoaching is something that as a managerI wish I had more time to do right tolike really explain things to people soI'm I'm really excited about sort oflike the advancements and theInvestments that we're making in Corpusunderstanding let's take it a little bitfurther down the stack one of the areasI'd like you to address in terms of newchallenges or things that need to bereviewed more is data itself dataquality data security data privacy regstuffdata quality and data labeling whateverare going to become so important aren'tthey because it's almost like amanufacturing problem if it isn't goodat the beginning it's going to get soexpensive to fix it later on that'sright so the focus on that for managerswill be yeah that's right so I thinkis whereis is going to become so important in inthis new era so because everything wascloud from the beginning you don't havea lot of data dispersed amongst likeindividuals laptops and and on-prem andand because of thatum we have built-in privacy and securityat the file and user level from the verybeginning so there isn't a lot ofre-architecture that we need to do inorder to kind of enable this next thisnext wave so the way that duet AI is isworking is that it's essentially justanother feature like we're carrying overall of the data sovereignty all of thesecurity and privacy controls into thisinto this new era without you know a bigstep function and change so I don't Idon't expectmanagers toum you know need to change the way thatthey operate in fact actually it's likeyou get this cool new capability withoutadditional new work right but we have alot of customers much of the world wasnot born in the cloud yeah are theygoing to be spending time focusing ontheir date on the roads I'm asking youfor give them some advice yeah companieslike that what do you think they need todo come come join us in Google workspaceI I you know I mean I'm I think that ifyou have if you have data and in on-premsystems that kind of like migrate intothe cloud I think it's going to beexceptionally important in order to takeadvantage of this in a secure andcompliant wayokay I want to turn to questions in justa minute but I want to ask you both whathave you learned and been surprised bywatching customers interact with thistechnology what have you seen them dothat's kind of been most compellingI think I've been really impressed withjust the level of creativity that we'veseen and I don't necessarily meancreativity like of course we've seenpeople write creative things and come upwith creative imagery and all that but Imean the level of creativity in terms ofreimagining how they might do things sohow they could respond more quickly totheir customers how they could build inum you know prompts that they've figuredout how to use to scale a problem or thesolution to a problem much more quicklydefinitely that piece about theinclusion element of including folks whohave been hesitant whether it's becausethey're newer or they weren't confidentin their communication whether it'sbecause of language or because of youknow being from a different domain orwhatever I think you know that to me hasbeenum really exciting to seeyeah the inclusion thing I think mattersa lot right and I think it like kind offits into this larger bucket of how AIis helping us to be more human rightlike how is it allowing us to connectmore and for for our co-workers whoweren't as much a part of theconversation for whatever reason how canthis technology help them do that andagain I think it's also like as we looktowards the future it's the you knowduet Ai and meetings right like I thinkin it previously you know we would havewe would designate someone as the notetaker as an example right but when we dothat that person is not meaningfullyparticipating in the conversation so howcan we use technology to kind of takethat so that we can do what we do bestright how do we kind of be creative worktogether in a collaborative way okaywell Croatia Tricia Christine thank youvery much for your time I reallyappreciate it thank you very much thankyouthank you"
