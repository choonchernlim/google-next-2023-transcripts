that we'll get into a uh just acouple little background itemsum so I'm Gary I'm one of the PMS on ameeting on the container run times forGoogle uh doing joined by xiaowen she'suh going to talk about Cloud run andAchieve mom's going to actually tell usabout the cool stuff Goldman Sachs is uptosolet me ask a quick question just to seewhere everybody is how many folks areactually running containers inproduction todayfantasticum if you weren't running them inproduction or you're running him in Devplan to do it in the next you know sixto 12 monthscool awesome and then I guessa more important question how many ofyou are using Cloud run or gkeI like this crowd already so I won't gointo too much detail here but um we'regonna Focus mostly on sort of cloud runin the serverless side but um really wehave sort of two container Platforms inuh Google Cloud now I should caveat thiswith uh I love containers so I'mobsessed with them so you'll have to I'mkind of like a fanboy for them so Ibelieve that they are kind of thecurrent wave where things are going togoum on the on the left hand or right handside for youum you know gkeum clearly most of you know we startedGoogle founded kind of kubernetescontributed that out there uh gke iskind of our Flagship managed kubernetesserviceum a lot of the things that we focus onthere are making it super simple to useyou may have seen the announcements fromTK and there's some other sessions todayon how we're hardening gke making itbetter for the Enterprise with gkeEnterpriseum and we'll talk a little bit aboutsome of the some of the security stuffwe have there uh for I don't want to sayfor simpler workloads but for folks whojust want to get quickly getting startedup and running get containers inproduction uh we have Cloud run reallyour sort of our you know serverlesscontainer platform right you do not seethe compute uh it does a lot of magicfor you uh and Shiva will cover that aswell foreignnow most of you are using containers butfor those of you who aren't uh you knowthere's a few fun facts that you knowone of the reasons why I like containersis when containers are used properlymeaning I I guess I started thisexpression do not treat containers likevirtual machinesum I think you know way back when whencontainers first came out with uh youknow way back when in like 20 wellcontainers have been around for a whilebut when Dockers say popularizedcontainers in 2014 you know we hadthings like hey let's use Ubuntu andDebian right and all of a sudden we hadthese big bloated container images andyou have the same vulnerabilities thatyou have at OS level right so you reallydon't want to treat kind of containersas VMS you want to treat containers asthe minimal thing to package whateverdependencies you need for yourapplicationand when you do that uh it makes itpretty simple to patch these thingsrightum you know you have minimaldependencies in there you can do theones are specific to your application toyour code Etcthe other thing containers are runtimetechnically immutableright now you can say you can do badthings if you want but technically youcan't just you sort of don't change themwhen they're sort of runningfrom a security perspective it's prettysimpleum to configure things I mean we'reusing things like c groups and otherthings underneath the covers if you lookat how we can figure it on cloud runyou'll see from a kubernetes perspectiveuh very simple uh to turn off thingslike privileged access uh the setpermissions on them so it's you knowmuch easier than if anybody actually hadto go in and like do security defaultsfor kind of a full operating system aswellum and the other thing isjust simpler in my opinion right to goaddum uh how we can sort of isolate thesethings right if you start looking atrunning I'm an old person so you know II know when people went to like you knowrunning stuff on bare metal and then youhave VMS and then people want to runningan app per VM because you can't isolateyour applications apps have differentdependenciesEtc from a container perspective they'realready isolated right at a base levelwe've implemented Technologies we usethem in Cloud run for actually isolatingmultiple containers from from each otheron the same host within gke we havesomething called gke sandbox which isactually based on gvisor and open sourcething which again gives us an enhancedisolation by basically intercepting allsystem calls right containerpreventing container breakouts so againthey're just a great simple way topackage your applications keep themisolated from each other and kind of getgoingthat being saidum I sometimes wonder that you said Ilove containers and then I show a slidethat says well here's all the potentialrisksum of deploying a kind of a containerproductionum in the endto some degree this isn't different thanany other sort of than any other sort ofpipeline right you can have all thesesame threats no matter how you're sortof depending your applications as you'llsee I think from a container perspectiveit's a lot easier to sort of fix thoserightclearly you can have issues with SourceI mean that's obviously one of thegreatest threats and vulnerabilitiesthat are in therebuild systems can be compromisedsomebody can kind of inject something inthere we've seen some of that stuff withsome of the uh the hacks from hackers onsome of the I'm not picking of Apple I'mlike Microsoft's distribution can be inthere obviously at deploy timeum you want to prevent Rogue actors youknow one thing about like uh a greatexample a long time ago I used to workat UH at IBM Microsoft made it such thatyou can have.net applications or comapplications talk to the Mainframe atthat time the Mainframe used to be superisolatedyou had to know how to speak snow onright applications there now we exposeit outside right there's additionalthreats and vulnerabilities that youneed to think about so it's simple todeploy containers but you have to alsoput some controls in place right to keeppeople from just deploying Roadcontainers out there and then finallywhat are the things that we can do tosort of measure things at at rev runtimeright can we look at is it still thesame container what access Etc is itmakingnow we'll cover a few of these in a fewslides butumso as with as with everything uh I thinkeverything you know buzzword termeverything kind of shifts leftI'm not a huge fan of saying that wehave to shift everything to Developersum but I think as we as we look atthings that sort of shift left goingback to the the sort of Prior slide howcan we put better controls and andthings in place like along this wholepipeline rightum such that and not necessarily A Devhaving to do everything but as things gothrough this life cyclesorryum how can we sort of deal with thisstuff right so making sure trust isobviously key something at some pointyou have to trust something in a test tosomething right and make sure that thatcame throughum and that's going to be sort of inyour process when you actually deploysomething how can you Ensurethat you deployed what you thought youbuiltright and how do we make sure that canhappenum and then finally at runtime how canwe make checks to make sure that youhaven't sort of violated all of thatum and we'll get into details on some ofthose in the later slidesum one thing that I since I only havelike 10 minutes one thing that I wantedto sort of call out iswe'll talk about how you can do some ofthese things but in the end there's kindof kind of an interesting technologythat came out there how many people haveheard of or you know familiar with allthis secure secure supply chain right uhs-bombs you know all these um buzzwordsoup out there right but but they allthey all kind of make sense right howcan I trace everything in itsdependencies uh how can I know where thevulnerabilities are how can I tracesomething to the life cycle so somethinglike binary authorization as you can seewe're gonna we'll talk about how you cando things at every step but how do youmake sure that by the time you get toproductionsomething has been through that Pipelineand all those steps have been takenum so binary authorizationum is one of the kind of cool things foryou there right to ensure that so fromour container runtime perspective uhit's built into Cloud run you can turnit on in gke I think on gke autopilotwe're going to actually turn it on bydefault uh soon and in this case you cansay my container must have novulnerabilities it must have been builtfor example by Cloud build it must havebeen proved and signed by this key andthat's going to keep Rogue actors frombasically being able to deploy thosethings onto your runtimesif we kind of put it all togetherum you know containers don't live in aworld by themselves especially in GoogleCloud I think the things you know I'vebeen here about two and a half yearsmaybeI think we've done a really nice job ofactually trying to put together kind ofthis end-to-end system which we'll talkabout a few pieces but obviously we canstart from a code perspective uh you'veprobably seen that we have things likesecure open source now right where we'reputting out packages for for uh pythonJava uh even go right that you can havetrusted and assured open source makesure you're pulling those in and nodepulling those in onlyum starting with secure base imageswhether you use R secure base images oryou use you know stuff from chain guardfor example it's a great company focusedon that uh buildings you know CV imagesthat are sort of light and minimumweightputting them into a registry scanningthem for vulnerabilities we have aregistry all other registries have thisstuffand then assuming you did all those kindof steps you can package that all uptogether that becomes your sort ofs-bomb you can attest it all that wasdone sign it from the binaryauthorization perspective have any auditcontrols logging Etc from your reportingperspective and then deploy itnow it's not I mean it's not going topresent prevent everything but in theend uh you've kind of got this reallysecure end-to-end kind of pipelineum and then the nice part here isbecause you're because we had acontainer we have the app we have the OSdependencies we have that we can do iton kind of that per application basisrather than having to separateeverything out right from here was my VMand you know hardened VM image thenhere's my app code then here'severything else I can consider considerthe container to be that unit ofdeployment holistic across thatapplicationI think that concludes my part so that'sjust some Basics we're happy to takequestions afterwards on a lot of thisstuffum we're going to talk a little bitspecifically Xiaolin is going to tell usabout all the great things that cloudRun's been doingall right thanks Garyhi everyone my name is Shawan I am thelead product managerof Enterprise networking security uhreally happy to be here this Wednesdaybright and early Wednesday morning Ihope everyone got a lot of good sleep ora lot of good coffee and we're ready totalk more about securityokay so for the next few minutes we'regoing to talk about a few designpatterns a couple of design patternsthat for some common use cases and talkabout how to secure themso oops wrong slide all right so as Garymentioned I'll talk much more aboutCloud run the design patterns that we'retalking about are built around Cloud runum that was Gary mentioned Cloud run isGoogle's fully managed container runtimethat's built around Simplicity andautomationin fact we have a lot of largeEnterprise large security sensitiveEnterprise customers that arestandardizing on cloud run as theirpreferred container runtime for theirhundreds if not thousands ofapplications across their many businessunits applications that come in ManyShades and sizes so if you're new toContainers you know as Gary's mentionedif you're new to Containers we recommendthat you start on cloudnow why do we make this recommendationwhy do people choose Cloud run so thefirst reason is cloud run is simple touse and simple to secure so as anexample we had a customer tell us a fewsome time ago that they were managingabout a dozen security relevant settingson cloud run versus 10x that many in adifferent container runtime now we allknow that complexity is the worst enemyof security so Cloud run hassecurity built in and on by defaultnumber twoCloud runs fully managed so there's noinfrastructure infrastructure for you tomanage or for you to secureand so in fact Cloud run runs on what wecall Borg which is our internalcontainer on time where Google deploysbillions of containers every week andit's also where we host some of some ofour some of our biggest properties likeGmail like um like YouTube like Googlesearch so so Cloud one is built to thehighest security standards that Googlehas for all of our internal software andit's important to protect Cloud runbecause that's important to protectingall of Googleand so that means you know Cloud run wehave rigorous you know code reviews forevery line of source code we havemultiple layers of sandboxing for allcustomer workloads we have zero trustTransport Security and we're usingstrong software supply chain securityand so much moreand and last Point Cloud one is builtfor developer velocity so for examplethere's a tool the cloud run providestooling for you to deploy directly fromsource code to production and and thatuses under the hood Google provided baseimages and sothese are base images that aremaintained by Google kept up to date andpatched we patch them every single weekand if there's an emergency situation wecan patch itum in a matter of hoursso if I want to summarize sorry if Iwant to summarize all this in one uhsentenceum it would be thisif you want to experience that joyfulfeelingwhen you're using a simple and elegantproducttake a look at cloudronokay so let's talk about the designpatterns the first design pattern is forinternal facing websites and web appsmaybe you have a company directory appor an HR website or an internal news appyou want to make sure that it's onlyavailable to your employees it'sinternal facing and it should stay thatwayokay so the architecture is actuallyvery simple maybe you have your frontend running Cloud run accessing adatabase in your VPC and maybe you haveyour traffic managed using a loadbalancer and you're authorizing yourusers using identity aware epoxy IEPso simple and effective architecturenow this is actually a great use caseand a great fit for cloud run becauseit's not only simple to run it on cloudone it's also very cost effective so allthese internal apps they don't actuallyget a lot of traffic especially duringoff hours you know weekends evenings andso Cloud run is able to scale down tozero when you have no traffic andquickly scale up if you need itright so there's no fixed infrastructurefootprint for you to maintain and youonly pay when you're serving trafficall right so how do we secure this let'stalk about Ingress or inbound trafficfirstsoum there's a few different components toconsider here first you have the loadbalancer on the load bouncer you canconfigure a few different securitysettings for example you can configure acloud armor to protect against DDOSattacksand second we talked about using IAPidentity aware epoxy to authorize yourbrowser users IEP is actually a prettycool product it has a lot of nicefeatures built in another thing you cando with IAP is to Grant access based oncontextual information like your likethe IP addresses of your end users ortheir device propertiesdevice attributes okay now when it comesto Cloud run there are two checks twomain checks to configure to make surethat the trafficum you'll you only allow traffic fromyour load balancer uh together with IAPso first configure the Ingress settingto allow only internal load balancertraffic and second configure IAMidentity access management to allow onlyiap's service accountso these two checks they're a networklevel check and an identity checkthey're fully independent and verycomplementary so you can enable one orthe other enable both and actually a lotof customers enable both together fordefense in depthand if you're new to Cloud run these areprobably the first two security settingsyou should learn because they're verybasic very powerful and and actuallyvery applicable to many many differentuse casesall right let's now talk about egresstrafficso for egos you know the main setting toknow is that there is there is a studyin in Cloud run to allow you to send alltraffic to a VPC so a VPC is yourprivate Networkum that's that's where you manage it asyou like you can apply custom policieslike firewall rules so a lot ofcustomers want to send all their trafficto a VPC so that's something you canconfigure on in Cloud run and speakingof EPC accessum I think there's a great feature thatwe just launched to public preview thatI hope everyone gets a chance to try outit's called directvpc egresswith directvpc egress Cloud one Servicescan now send traffic directly to a VPCwithout proxying it through a connectorso it's much easier to use it's fastermuch lower latency than before much muchhigher throughput and it's lower cost sowe've had a lot of customers try it outso customers I care for and pack manymany customers try it out and gettinggreat results so I'm a bit biased but Ido think that this is a must-havefeature for a lot of customersand one more thing is I I do think thatyou know I've said Cloud run is a reallyjoyful product to use I think you knowVPC access was previously not exactlyvery joyful but I do think we arebringing the joy back now withall right um the last thing I want tomention on this slide is you know wetalked about a few different securitydevelopment settings if you want toenforce specific specific settingsacross all of your cloud-bone servicesin your project and your folder and yourorganization then you know take a lookat organization policies so the settingsthat I talked about earlier the inqueststudy the IEM setting the ego settingthey're all subject to more policiesall right so with that I'll we'll coveranother design patternum this one is for running internal webservices and potentially microservicesservices that need to be able to easilycommunicate back and forthso there are many different variationsof this design pattern maybe you haveyour services running in a mix ofdifferent platforms they're running oncloud run they're running on VMS they'rerunning on gke maybe they're runningon-prem connected to your VPC using aVPN or interconnectso you know aside from that maybethey're using different networkconfigurations maybe they're in the sameproject sitting on a standalone VPC ormaybe they're distributed acrossdifferent projects and connectedtogether using a shared VPCand maybe you have all your trafficgoing through a load balancer aninternal load balancer or maybe you'recalling Cloudland Services directlyusing their built-in run.app URL so manydifferent variations of this designpattern now umfor all these variationsthe same settings that I mentionedearlier in the previous slide they theystill apply so you have your inquestsetting you can use that setting torestrict access at the network layer youhave your IAM check to restrict accessbased on caller identity you have youregress setting to send all traffic to aVPC and you have org policies to enforcespecific specific settings across all ofyour servicesnow one thing to pay attention hereum with this design pattern is fortraffic that's going to a cloud runservicebe pay attention to how it's routedif you are using the Ingress setting arestrictive English setting then makesure that that traffic is using a VPCtraffic that's going to Cloud run itshould be using a VPCso if you're using an internal loadbalancer the ilb then that's alwaysusing a VPC and that's fine if you'recalling the built-in run.app URLdirectlythen um check a few things if the calleris a cloud run service then the easiestthing for you to do is to just configureto send all traffic to a VPC and you'regoodif you're using a shared VPCthenum we do have a feature of a previewright now to support this traffic aslong as the destination Cloud runservice is attached to the same sharedVPCand number three if the caller ison-prem connected using a VPN orinterconnect then configure privateGoogle access or private service connectto resolve your run.app domain to aprivate IP so that so that's routed overthe VPCokay so that's it for the designpatterns that I want to talk aboutum they were very basic design patternsand some of our larger securitysensitive Enterprise customers theybuild upon these basic patterns toincorporate their more advanced securityneeds so uh one such customer is GoldmanSachs and with that I'll pass it over toShivam from Goldman Sachs to tell usmore about how they build anarchitecture based on cloud run andGoogle Cloudthank youhello everyone thank you for joining andbeing part of the presentation todaygood morning uh I'm Shivam Dalal vicepresident at Goldman Sachs and I'll betalking over how we apply many layers ofDefense to secure our container appslet me talk a bit about Goldman Sachsfirst for folks who are not familiarit's a global financial institution withmany lines of different business whichare global banking and markets asset andwealth management and platform Solutionsour clients include corporations otherfinancial institutions governments andindividualstechnology is at the core of everythingwhat we do we have a hybrid Cloudenvironment where we manage our own datacenters in private Cloud as well as weuse public Cloud so going to my role atGoldman Sachs I'm part of cloudenablement team and our mission is toempower Engineers to be able to usepublic Cloud securely and effectivelywith that I want to go over like theproblem statement of what we have aspart of a platform team so we want toensure our development teams can movefast building applications on gcpwithout compromising Security in orderto do this we need to send preventiveguardrails that ensure compliance behindthe scenes without adding overheadlet's focus on the things which arehighlighted over here move fast we wantthe developer velocity to be as high aspossible and the time it takes to deployapplication to be minimalwithout compromising security so this iswhere like accidental configuration ofresources can lead to some gaps insecurity we want to avoid that and lastpreventive guardrails this is where ourrole as a platform team comes in thepicture where we set the right layers ofDefense to protect the resources in gcpbasically to the gist is that we wantour developers from the lines ofbusiness to focus on solving thebusiness problems and using theTechnologies in gcpand not be too worried about how to makeyour app compliant with all theregulations been imposed in thefinancial industryall right so we we I mentioned that wewant our developers to move fast so wechose Cloud run uhbasically we chose Cloud run because asshown mentioned there are a lot ofbenefits to it one it's serverlessrequires no infrastructure maintenanceand then it was a good fit for a lot ofour use cases which I'm going to talkabout in uh the next couple of slides sothe first use case we have is like APIand microservices so imagine a team atGoldman Sachs wants to build acontainerized microservices hosting abunch of rest apis the goal over here isto allow them to securely deploy acontainer workload which is accessiblefrom our on-premise Network as well asother workloads within Google Cloud viaprivate Network and then the applicationshould be able to interact with certainGoogle database offerings like bigqueryspanner and authenticate using Googleidentitieslet's go over the next use case so thisis basically trigger based batchprocessing soagain a team at Goldman Sachs is usingbigquery for searching and analyzing logdatawe want to have them enrich log Databefore ingesting into bigquery by addingmetadata so this this use case is alsoperfect for cloud run because it'sserverless the application Auto scaleson demand because log data can vary andthen again we want to make thisaccessible from on-premisesnow that I've talked about the two usecases I want to go over like basicallywhat do we do as platform team to makesure that we enable Cloud run as aservice sowe use all of these tools available inGoogle Cloud to Aid in setting thepreventive guardrails so with a quickshow of hands how many of you have usedmore than two of these products orservicesall right that's a good number uh howmany of you have used more than fourall right that's a good number okay soI'll just go over quickly like uh howeach of these tool helps us in settingthe right preventive guardrail sostarting from the left I am Grant thisallows who can do what on a resource nowwhat we do is we create custom adminroles for each service we try to onboardon within the Forum so we want to limitthe number of permissions that servicehas uh basically for the developers sowe don't want to Grant basic primitiveroles like owner view or editor or eventhe predefined roles instead we want tohave a set of restrictive permissionswhich our developers can have access toand then this can be used by teamsthemselves as well to control their iamthe next is I am deny this is again avery useful tool which allows you toblock explicitly use of over permissiveresource in resourcesthe next in the slide is VPC servicecontrols I would highlight and probablythis could be a takeaway for a lot offolks who are not using this this islike one of a biggersecurity kind of protecting tool whichwe use where we allow all of ourprojects around that we create a bubblewhich is basically like protected by theperimeter so VPC service control kind ofallows you from a lot protects you froma lot of data exfiltration so I wouldstrongly recommend you guys to checkthis out uh I think orc policy most ofyou are familiar Xiao and even mentionedallows you to enforce guard rails aroundyour resource configurations uh if youguys hadn't attended yesterday's talk Ithink the they are also coming up withcustom or policies so that might againbe very useful in setting some uhresource configuration constraints andthen finally we have tags and policyintelligence which are also useful inlike adding layers of Defenseso now that I've spoken about like thedifferent uh tools which are availableat our disposal to use how do we usethis in combination with Cloud runso I'll give you a quick second to seethe screen basically in this diagram wehave a typical use case of our Cloud runinstance accessing a storage bucket anduh some someone on premises is trying toinvoke the cloud run instance so if youlook at the screen uh the green pathswhich are there from top to bottom arewhat we call as happy paths so these arepaths which are okay to have and there'sno security threats or anything which ispossible in there basically anon-premises server is accessing thecloud run instance via dedicatedinterconnect or be it VPN over privateNetwork and then the storage bucket isagain sitting inside the same project orcould be within a different project inthe same organizationhowever what's important over here isthat the red X's which you see in thediagram are the parts which are I callunhappy Parts like you don't want themto ever be uh like compromised sostarting from the left if you go fromIngress on the left hand sideCloud run being in Google's VPC accessfrom internet or having access from anunauthorized project could lead topublic exposure of private data or itcould lead toyour application being compromised incase of stolen credentials so the way wekind of protect against these threatsare again as I mentioned a combinationof our policies I am and VPC servicecontrol so the green box you see on theslide is basically the service perimeterit's kind of think of it as a bubblearound all of the projects you own orlike you can create multiple VPC servicecontrols depending on like your zones orenvironments and uhdoesn't allow like projects which arenot part of the parameter now moving tothe right hand side for egressum I want to highlight that again Cloudrun being in Google's VPC and has accessto the internet you can exfiltrate datafor example in case of malicious Insideror let's say you have a compromised coderunning you you can basically send datato unauthorized Google apis like GmailGoogle drive or even use the storagecopy from like service to service copyto copy data over to an unauthorizedbucketall right so let's dive deep into like acouple of specific org policies which weset for cloud run Ingress and egress sowe as I mentioned we want to restrictall our traffic to private Network sothe Run dot allowed Ingress is uh set toa value called internal and Cloud loadbalancing this basically prevents allour developers from creating Cloud runinstance open to the publicthe next one is allowed VPC egress weset this value to all trafficthis makes sure that all the trafficwhich is routed from cloud and containeris routed to the serverless accessconnector and as shavan mentioned thiswas basically a lot of operationaloverhead for us to manage uh serverlessaccess connector and with direct VPCegress now being in preview we'll behappy to start using thatthis is another or policy which is uhpreventing unauthenticated access so inGoogle you can have IM binding whichsays allow all users to access basicallymy cloud run this is something we wantto avoid in case of accidentalconfiguration or some malicious intentso the way we do it isset an ALT policy which says only allowpolicy member domains set to ourorganization so this prevents thedevelopers from setting thatfinally I wanted to go over a couple ofcloud and patterns which might befor folks over here which I think is uhone how do you access a cloud run fromon-premises and the second one is how doyou access Google services and otherapis from your cloud and container so inin the diagram over here basically Iwanted to highlight a key componentswhich are interconnect and the privateservice connect endpoint which is in thetransit VPC uhtraffic flows from on-premises computeto the cloud run instance via those andkey thing to keep in mind is the privateservice connect endpoint in transit VPCis of Target type vpcsc this ensuresthatyour traffic only goes to the restrictedGoogle apis which is again uh isprotected by the VPC service controls souh those are the two important thingsand then run.app URL is part of therestricted.googleapis.com so you canpretty much hit any Cloud run serviceacross multiple projects as long as theyall belong to the same parameterall right the next pattern is how do youaccess other Google services and Cloudrun from within a cloud run instance soas I mentioned previously in the orgs ORpolicy slide we require that cloud runtraffic all is routed to the egressconnector so that's the number two overthere and then basically we make surethat the subnet on which the connectoris has private Google access enabled andagain just that configuration itselfmight not be secure enough what you needto make sure is that you have the rightDNS setting to configure that all Googleapis traffic is routed torestricted.google apis this againensures that the traffic can only flowto all the services which are protectedby vpcsc and what we do is any newservice we add like for example Cloudrun we add it to the restricted apislist in the vbc service controls andthis way the access from the subnet tounauthorized Google apis or tounauthorized project is preventedwith that I'd like to conclude my talkand hand it over back to show and thankyou[Applause]all right thank you so Goldman Sachs hasbeen a great customer and it's beensuper fun to work together to meet theirAdvanced needsokay so I'll just take a couple minuteshere at the very end to summarize someof the features that we talked about soplease try out directly PC egress thatlets you easily connect to a VPC it'seasier faster and costs lesstake a look at Ingress and egresssettings that lets you restrict andmanage the traffic to and from yourCloud on servicetake a look at IAM the IEM setting thatlets you add another layer of Defenseuse all policies to enforce specificsettingsnumber five use VPC service controls youknow it really talked about VPC servicecontrols as a as being a very importantpart of their architecture to protectagainst data exfiltrationnumber six take a look at using Googlemaintained base images so you can relyon Google to patch them keep themupdated to keep them up to date andespecially in the case of a you know aof a security vulnerabilityand number seven use binaryauthorization to make sure that youronly your approved images can be run inproduction now we talked about a lot offeatures a lot of great features today Ijust want to mention that we you know wedidn't have time to cover everything andin fact there's one feature that I wantto mention that we didn't get to coverbut I think it's super exciting soum at Cloud next this time we areannouncing that a cloud run now supportsin public preview uh sidecar supportso now you can runa sidecar container next to your maincontainer to add additionalfunctionality so and this is superimportant for security use cases forexample you can run an Envoy proxy as asidecar container or you can run oppaopen policy agent as a sidecar containerto enforce your custom authorizationpolicies and there's a talk at Cloudnext that's dedicated to that feature oncloud run so take a look at thatokay uh sorry people in the wrongdirection all right and I'll finallyfinally I'll leave you with a fewresources if you are getting start ifyou are new take a look at our quickstarts if you want detailstake a look at our security guide andour private networking guide and if youare ready to go ready to automate take alook at our terraform blueprints so withthat thank you all for being a greataudience if you're new to Cloud run Ihope you get a chance to try it out andexperience the joy for yourself[Music]"
