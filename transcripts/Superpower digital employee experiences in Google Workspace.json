Alliance organization andI run our collaboration and workspaceisv ecosystem program I've been atGoogle 14 years that entire time hasbeen dedicated to customer facingpartner-facing roles 100 committed toboth workspace and Google Cloud sotoday's topic about superchargingdigital employee experiences withworkspace is one very near and dear tomy heart and my career here at Google soI'm honored and excited to be here withme is uh my esteemed partner John Radkofrom OpenText uh John do you want tointroduce yourselfI'm the senior vice president ofEnterprise engineering for open text soI I lead the product groups for Contentmanagement business Network digitalexperience and platform and I'm reallyexcited to be here Google's a majorpartner of ours especially for all ofthe engineering teams I lead and we'rereally excited to share with you whatwe're doing with Google workspace greatso without further Ado we're going todive into the content at the end of thesession we have a microphone right uphere in this aisle over here we'll betaking questions so if you have anywrite them down hold them and thenplease feel free to ask those at the endof the session we're going to go througha little bit about the open text inGoogle Cloud partnership what it meansfor us each other as two differentcompanies partnering together buthopefully much more importantly what itmeans for our joint customers we aregoing to dive a little bit intoobviously our new product offering thatwe want to talk to you about core forGoogle workspace most importantly we aregoing to show you what I'm told is awicked cool demo and I've been told todescribe it every time as a wicked cooldemo so we'll get to that point here inthe session and then like I mentionedearlier take questionsthanks go ahead take me to the nextslide if you would mind I just want totell you a little bit about OpenTextbecause I know everyone's not familiarwith us open text is probably thelargest software company that mostpeople have never heard of we are thelargest software company in Canada andwe like to think of ourselves as theinformation company we help Enterprisesmanage their information so they canwork smarter that's our whole themeworking smarter whether it's aroundGeneral content management or arounddigital experience which can includecustomer Communications management aswell as web experience managementor in the area of B2B transactions withthe OpenText business Networkalso outside of the areas I lead we havea major cyber security proumbusiness unit which include things likeArc site which is a security eventsmanager as well as in case for forensicsWebroot and Carbonite some people may beWebroot or Carbonite customers in theroom and then finally with our recentacquisition of microfocus we also doMainframe modernization yes we are oneof the last providers of a Cobaltcompiler I think on the planet Earth soOpenText is a widespread portfolio ofproducts but what unifies them alltogether is information and we prideourselves on meeting customers wherethey are and what I mean by that iswherever customers want to be generatingand collaborating on content we're goingto be working with them there and that'swhat's led us to this stage today withGoogle workspacenow I want to talk a little bit aboutwhy open text in Google this is afantastic partnership and I don't justsay that lightly the best technologyPartnershipsbuild from the strengths of each companyand so if you think about what Google'sgood at we started this partnership fiveyears ago because customers wanted touse our software in gcp and so we builta whole practice with Google aroundoperating our software in gcp but thatwas just the beginning Google helped uson our containerization journey to helpus modernize our software so it coulddeploy and they also helped usunderstand that a lot of customers wereadopting workspace and that was wherethe content we managed for manycustomers was going to be generatedso we wanted to partner with them to dothat that partnership and evolutionyou're going to see the fruits of ittoday but you're also go I also want youto know it continues to evolve and we'llgive kind of a teaser of some of theAviator work we're doing at open textwith Google vertexso as John was talking about ourpartnership started five years ago andit started around a modernizationjourney with their OpenText customerswanting to run in gcp but thepartnership is so much more than thattoday today Google cloud is one of thepreferred the preferred cloud providerfor open text and we do a variety ofthings that John already mentioned andwe're going to talk a few about a few ofthem here todaysecondly they are absolutely a strategicpartner for us delivering I'm sorry forour customers delivering Enterprisescale Information Management Solutionsacross the board and they've been doingthat for years if you take thatexperience of open text and you coupleit with Google's leading spot as a cloudcloud computing vendor bringing toMarket some of the very first EnterpriseSolutions SAS platform andinfrastructure and bring those twotechnology Stacks together that isreally at the core of what we feel makesthis partnership so valuable you have alegacy experience in InformationManagement security and modernizationyou have a leading cloud providerhelping companies innovate and modernizeand you bring those two things togetherand that provides amazing value for ourjoint customersI want to give you a little flavor ofwhat we've done with the partnershipthen we're going to drill into corecontent for Google workspaceum first we're using Google workspacefor its embedded generative AIcapabilities that's our BN Aviatorprogram we use that across ourexperience Suite where customers cangenerate content for outbound marketingCommunications inside of our extremeproduct we're also using that startingin our fourth quarter release in corecontent to allow customers to summarizedocuments and summarize informationabout a business workspace which I'lltalk about in a little bit we also havean integration with our experience Suitewhere customers who are using ourexperience suite for marketing whetherit's outbound or receiving inbound canintegrate to audience management toolson Google because Google is used by mostof our customers for their web marketingefforts so again it's that idea ofintegrating to the strengths of eachcompany so that customers can get themost out of the combination withouthaving to change how they're workingokay so a little bit more of a flavor aswell about some of the joint solutionsfrom open text because before we diveinto core for workspace we really wantto land the point about the breadth anddepth of this partnership and what itmeans for our customers so we talkedabout modernization the word Innovationis a word people use a lot the wordInnovation I think gets thrown around alot but to really be able to innovatefor both yourself and your customers youneed to modernize first and a lot ofwhat open text and Google do is helpingcompanies modernize John talked aboutMainframe modernization and our dual runsolution but there's a host of otherways that we help organizationsmodernize before they can open up theability to innovate togetherthe second thing is really aroundsecurity so both Google and open texthave been leaders in the security spacefor a number of years but in verydifferent ways so whether it's theinformation Management Solutions theSecurity Solutions that John talkedabout OpenText has a really stronghistory there and so does Google byproviding that we've seen all acrossthis show today and you see in everyother talk in every other event in itthat data is absolutely the foundationalbuilding block of almost any companystrategy today in fact most companies nolonger identify themselves with the CoreBusiness they're in they describethemselves as data companies so bringingtogether to vendors helping companiesorganize and secure that data is also ahuge benefit of this partnershipand then finally the speed to Innovationwhen you've got the modernization downwhen you've got the Innovation enginechurning the speed to Innovation istruly something that helps bring thingsto light and where I think thispartnership shines we started talkingabout this product over a year ago thatwe're helping launch right now westarted talking about this demo threemonths ago yet in the last three monthsthe way this partnership is built wehave actually evolved this talk thatwe're giving right now and what thisproduct looks like centered aroundthings like Aviator and Google AI withGoogle cloud with vertex Ai and thatonly is possible when the speed toMarket and the speed of innovation isthereso we've been talking a lot about corefor Google workspace let me talk alittle bit about what it is if we canmove to the next slideGoogle workspace is a fantastic productit's even more fantastic than I thoughtit was yesterday having seen the demosthis morning but there's an interestingquestion so one of the cool demos um dideveryone see the demo where they createdthe the slide presentation dynamicallyfrom looker I think it was that wasamazing okay now we're going to presentthat to someone to a customer to anexecutive what happens then because mostof the use cases we're talking about areindividuals right it's on my drive it'slocal it's here one of the challengesfor large Enterprises today is there'stwo worlds there's this really Dynamicfast-moving world right where you'reusing productivity Suites and you cancollaboratively edit and everything andthen there's like this other world ofcontrolled data records managementapprovals flowsum digital signatures and now I need tobring those two together and how do weinterface those two in a way that worksfor users and I'm not even talking aboutthe third world the third world is theapplications we live inside of for manyof us collaborative tools are where welive that could be something likeworkspace or teams or something else butfor many people they live inside oneapplication predominantly an sap or asales force so what we're trying to dowith core content for Google workspaceis to bring those three worlds togetherin a way that works for end users sothat they can get all the value out ofit but one caveat before we we talk alittle more about it we don't want tolose the good that's in each world so inother words I can't put documents thatoriginated in Google workspace underEnterprise control by tearing it out ofGoogle workspace and sticking at some ithas to still live there right you stillhave to be able to collaboratively edityou've still got to get all the goodstuff so that every time we come back toGoogle next and they get up there on thestage and tell you all the cool stuffthey've done for workspace it stillworks with everything but we need somemore controls and we need some morecapabilities that are part of Enterprisecontent management and that's what thisis all aboutsoumone of the things I want to hit on onemore time and and a little bit deeper iskind of what the value of of workingtogether really means for our customersuh smarter digital experiences you knowGoogle was at the very beginning of theSAS collaboration uh Evolution orrevolution a number of years ago in factwe helped Define and drive that thatchange and really what we've been doingis we've been helping change the waypeople do work all around the world forthe better half of 15 or 16 years in theproduct Suite that we call Googleworkspace today and at the heart of thatproduct Suite is really collaborationand one of the things that workspace didis it drove a fundamental shift in theWay employees work together the way theyget together the way they talk the waythey create the way they do their job ona day-to-day basis workspace was at theheart of driving that nowthe key thing about Google workspacewhich I think we're trying to land heretoday is that workspace besides being aproduct more importantly is a platformand it's a platform that allows anecosystem to grow around it of strongPartners whether it be open text butpartners that can extend the abilityinto individual use cases of a company avertical an industry a geography andthat platform approach helps bringscalable and Secure Solutions to ourcustomers and finally it's just best ofbreed content management and at the endof the day it has to be best of breedand what John was saying earlier it hasto integrate into those applicationsthat your users use today on a dailybasis whether it be Salesforce or sap orsomething elseall right okay sothe wicked cool demo right so aconfession first this is a recorded demoI freely admit that we had ManyAdventures when we were getting ready todo this but if there are doubters in theroom and I'm a doubter so it's fine youcan walk over to the booth I challengeyou to find the booth with a guy wearinggoggles in an office chair is rocketingup with with rocket engines it's in thatdirection and and Torsten will show youthis demo live as well as some otherdemos so we wanted to make sure that wespent our time on the features so I didthat one other caveatlong before the Google OpenTextpartnership we each decided to use aword this is not uncommon in thetechnology sector and that word isworkspace so you're going to hear a lotabout workspaces and taking documentsfrom Google workspace and putting theminto a business workspace so just I'llbe very careful to say businessworkspace when I talk about businessworkspace it's an entity it's a locationthat I'm going to talk a little bitabout that's part of core contenteverybody with meokayso the first thing I wanted to show wasjust the home interface this is notgoing to be the world'sare we goingyep we're good okayoh let me go back can you take me back Ican do thatokaythis is our content management systemwhoopmesee this is why I gave you the heads upthis is our home interface I won't Iwon't run the okayour home interface and what it has is ithas an Enterprise repository it's gotfolders and it's got a few other thingsthat may not be obvious so let me talkthrough itI'm gonna have to play it I guessokayhere you're going to see integration toSalesforce there you're going to seeintegration to sapI don't know what it's doing hereapologiesyep I'm going to pause it for you youmay pause itokay so the uhin that on that home screen you have apretty typical content management typesystem you can drill into Enterprisedata now what's the difference betweenthis and a folder structure this iscorporate data so this will be dataabout your customers it'll be about yourprojects maybe your department thanksum and and it gives you your home pagehere I want you to remember thisinterface because if if this doesn'tseem like an interface someone mightwant to use like a sales person we'regoing to address that in a few minutesokayover here the pointers to this globaltrade global trade looks like it mightbe a file but it's not and I want totalk about this because this is such acritical concept for usis itgoing or do I have to all right yeahI'll just pause it there we go okaythanks so this is the business workspaceI talked about and it's global tradeglobal trade is a customer everybodyknows what a customer is rightsoas we go overwait did it keep going yep I'll pause itfor youokay if we can go back we can havemultiple business workspaces tiedtogether so you have a customer you haveprojects you have um you have bills youhave rfps that are pending salesopportunities invoices and the wholeidea of a business workspace is that youcreate a structure in your system thatties together documents workflows andmetadata that's what we're seeing hereso this at the top is metadata and whatI want to because of this is a customerthe metadata is actually being pulledover from Salesforce this structureunder here the say the folder structurethat's a standard whenever I create acustomer and I pull the data over fromSalesforce I will create this structureall rightyou tell me when to play and I'll justhit pause I'll just I'll I'll go herewe'll just remote control it a littlemore intensely go for itapologies for the technical difficultiesokayso this is the business workspace on thetop you'll see the metadata why doesthis even matter because sometimes youwant some structure to your informationwe talk about content in contextthis could be the in this case it linksover to Salesforce but if it was aproject it could be a link to a projectmanagement system we could have aproject manager who's assigned to itthis is metadata that's not in any ofthe documents so let me move forward alittle bit and talk about the Googleworkspace integrationhere what you'll see is relatedworkspaces so each of these is aworkspace that that you could go to thathas its own folder structure its ownworkflows and these are also tied in oneis tied into Salesforce one is told intied into sapnow let's drill into a given folder andwhat we're doing here is we're lookingat the properties of a folder this isall additive to what Google workspacedoes we can associate metadata and trackspecific versions the versions come overfrom the Google workspacenow this is a Google doc but we can dothe exact same thing for any other docsPDFs word docs all in that sameworkspace now these are actually storedin different places and you can see wehave the ability to open those documentsup in Google Google Docs and applydifferent features as we goso now we're going to drill in and takea look at an actual documentand you can see that we're opening thisparticular document the contract this isin Google Docs you'll see up there it'sa Google Docs it has single sign-inacross the two so that end users areworking where they're most comfortablethey can go into Google workspace we'regoing to show in a moment how to add anew documentas we hover over here these are some ofthe capabilities that core contentbrings the ability to place retentionpolicies once you have a contract if youretain it for a certain amount of periodcertain amount that's a policyassociated with the contract workspaceand you get that for free as it were ifyou move your contract if you go aheadand add it to the business workspacelikewise you can request a signature andcore content will manage the Gatheringof that signature you can also insert itfor a workflow so one of the documentswe're going to show later is we're goingto pull a pitch in it's a pitch deck toa customer that's a fairly commonscenario in fact some of the really coolworkspace demos I've seen have shown AIto help generate a pitch deck for acustomer but maybe in your organizationthose decks get reviewed before they goout like like these decks did for thisevent you can actually put it into aworkflow and it'll track it but it neverleaves Google drive it stays in therethe whole timeso now we're going to add a documentfrom Google Driveand I'm going to capture this as we goin we're going to your local GoogleDrive we're going into the global tradefolder we're going to select a documentand we're going to add it back into thebusiness workspacethere's a couple of key points I want tomake here in just a momentwhat's going on here first just likewhen you're uploading from your localdrive this is taking a copy and this isgoing to be a controlled copy in thebusiness workspace what's going on hereit's so subtle you could miss it iswe're adding metadata we picked a typethis is a sales force contract and sowe'll talk about has it been signed andwhat's the signing date so we'veAssociated metadata for this that'll goin the business workspace and we'll staywith the document for the rest of itslife as long as it's in core content youcan add whatever metadata you want andthat's part of what makes it anEnterprise content management system theability to do thatthe last thing I really wanted to showhere was we talked earlier about meetingcustomers where they areand in this casewhat we're demonstrating is our salesforce integration I'm going to pause itfor a moment this is anyone recognizesalesforce.com anyone familiar with theSalesforce and okay this is theSalesforce Center excellent things thisis the Salesforce interface but you maynot be used to seeing this documents topbecause that's coming from core contentand it's a view into a businessworkspace that's associated earlier Ishowed you the metadata in the othersystem this is the exact same set ofdata but someone working here is able toactually interact with content directlyin Salesforce now that content will besubject to all the same Enterprise rulesand and and policies that are present soin this case what you're going to see iswe're importing a pitch deckfrom Google Drivewe go in we navigate into the folder weselect the deck and we're going to bringit up it's in the meetingsso it'll get added hereand now just to prove it we're going toopen it upnowI apologize for the glitches with therecording here but what I want toexplain is what's going on heresomeone's able to go in Salesforcethey're able to pull a document off ofGoogle Drive maybe it's something theyuse duet to generate maybe they did itthe old-fashioned way but now it'sAssociated to a meeting that's inSalesforce with that documents top whydo you care let me turn it around for asecond we're in a bunch of HR processesback at back at the ranch right now andthe ability to go from our HR Systeminto documents and back and forth isreally helpful for sales leaders it'sthe same thing when I'm visiting aclient as an executive sponsor I want toknow what the client was told if I cango into Salesforce and I can go find alist of the last meetings and look atthe decks and maybe copy them andunderstand and ask people questionsabout it that's very powerful a lot ofpeople in our organization don'tnecessarily have access to Salesforcethey may not have access to sap but byusing this integration we'll have thebusiness workspaces integrated acrossthe the net hereum and that is the the end of the demothe net here is that Google workspace isa fantastic collaboration platformbut it can be even more powerful bylayering on Enterprise level featuresthat let you put policies that let youorganize the content into an Enterpriseframe and that let you give that contentin context we're excited about thepartnership and what we're doingtogether and hope you have a fantasticweek here at Google Cloud next thank youso much[Music]foreign"
