interesting foryou we are going to be talking aboutmeet video conferencing hybrid workand this will be a moderated panel andwe have our guests on stageuh I am haruko sorry I'm haruko I workon workspace and meet Partnerships forGoogleand with me we haveThomas usaki from brandlive Brian Thomasfrom Lenovo and Dan lawyer from lucidrightThomas sure what do you do in my lifehello everyone I'm Thomas from brandlivewhere I run the product organization atbrandlive we're really focused onReinventing larger meetings specificallypresentation based meetings things likeTown Halls webinars that type of thingand our products are designed to helphosts put onwell-produced differentiated compellingcontent for those occasions that's it'sapart from the day-to-day world of videoconferencing in some cases andthis edition of cloud next is a is avery special moment for us and ourpartnership with Google as we'reactually here announcing a productintegration with Google meet which we'requite excited about and there's anothersession about on demand if if you wantto learn moreyeah uh so thanks for having me heretoday I'm excited to be here at GoogleMax my name is Brian Thomas I'm thesenior director of smart collaborationportfolio on alliances at Lenovo ourbusiness is really focused on helpingour customers Implement hybrid worksolutions for both in the office and athome employees as part of that effortwe've partnered with Google and Googleseries one over the last three years todeliver a room solution that reallyhelps our customers get the most out oftheir meeting room experiences throughleveraging both audio and video AITechnologies and be happy to talk alittle bit more about that today andwe've got a booth down below where wecan demonstrate that as wellthanks Brianand then Dan I'm Dan lawyer I'm thechief product officer at Lucid Softwareand Lucid has had a long history withGoogle we've enjoyed a partnership withthem for a long time in fact back in2010 that's in the way back machine wewere one of the launch partners with theworkspace Marketplace and we've beenbuilding Integrations ever since we'veenjoyed a really good kind of top levelleadership engagement Lucid what our ourco-founder one of our co-founders andnow chairman of the board it was anearly googler it was over patents andBusiness Development things like thatand so we've had a lot of relationshipsover time with Google and and togetheryou know it's been really fun as Googlehas built out their product Suite webuilt out our product suite and andtogether we've been able to helpmillions of people to really experiencethe value of visual collaboration asthey've engaged and used what is now 13Integrations that we've done with Googleworkspace and and more to come I'm wehave yet more Integrations that we thinkstill need to be there so we're excitedabout itthanks Danall rightum just before we dive into thequestions uh I want to frame theconversation a bit about where we aretoday and I know the previous sessionwas talking about productivity we'regoing to focus on hybrid work and meetthere's lots of lots of words that havebeen floating around here that aresimilar but um we've gotten back to theoffice but video meetings have stayedand we've continued to have the need forreal-time Communications and hybrid workrequires effort and you know we want tomake sure that everyone is able toparticipate in discussions and feelconnected and many organizations I thinkare looking for better tools to engageinattendees and make video feel as closeto in-person connections as possibleand as part of that effort Google hasaddressed these challenges by engagingin a growing number of our ecosystemPartners three of whom are here todayand a lot of our partners are inEnterprise productivity tools engagementtools used in the classrooms digitalcollaboration tools and HardwarePartners like Lenovo who help us buildthe best in class meeting experiencesand I'm looking forward to hearing howour leaders in Industry are thinking ofhybrid workawesome great so we will dive into thequestions the current state ofcommunication and productivity toolsum so Thomas let's start with youTrends challenges opportunities what arethe challenges you see in meeting andcollaboration what kinds of issues arecompanies facing and what are thebiggest areas of opportunitysure so Trend wise I think maybe I'llstart from an employee or an end userperspective it is easier than ever tomeet we are working hybrid or remote andand so we're hopping on meetings andmore compelled to meet than ever beforemeeting technology is built into all ofthe tools that we're using on aday-to-day basis and this fluidcommunication style leads to moremeetingsall the timeand from a company perspective so takingthe flip side you see an increase in thevolume of meetings and we have morecommunication channels in some casesthan we know how to deal with or knowhow to manage and so it's important Ithink as companies look at the effectthat coming out of the pandemic andmoving into a hybrid world it'simportant to to think about the toolsthat you're offering to employeesbecause work is going to occupy the toolset or the channels that you offer itand so companies as they see somealarming Trends perhaps to some folks interms of the volume of meetings and thetime spent in meetings relative to workbefore the pandemic our need to takeinto consider consideration meetingculture as an aspect of culture at largeand potentially an area where you canthink about creating competitiveadvantages inside of your team and yourorganizationrightall right Brianso how do you think about this so frommy perspective and at Lenovo you knowwe're continually hearing about back tooffice initiatives from our customersum they're all struggling to find TheSweet Spot on that and the fact of thematter is you know we're seeing reallyno customers that are successfullyimplementing a full-backed officeenvironment and so that really createshybrid as a trend right I mean we'retalking about hybrid but hybrid is thereality of the situation and how do wedeal with an environment where you havesome employees in the office and someemployees that are remoteso that's really the the key Trend we'reseeing but the challenge that we see onthat is really around when you'relooking to try to get employees backinto the office we only have about 15 xactually fewer than that of meetingspaces that are video enabled so we'recoming from a space where employees havebeen at home and all of their meetingshave been video enabled and then you'retrying to get them back into an officewhere they're likely to walk into aspace and they're going to have aconference to call a speakerphone on thetable and they have no video and that'snot an appealing environment to getsomeone back in the office to have thattype of trade-off and experience sothat's the key challenge that we seethat kind of brings us on to anopportunityso obviously if we're able to videoenable those rooms with basic video USBcamera USB video that's good but itcreates an opportunity in what we callan equitable meeting space so when youlook at just basic USB video USB audioin a video space yes you're getting avideo stream out but it's not anequitable experience so you're used toin the pandemic this Mass video adoptionwhere everybody really had an equalplaying field right everybody would lookthe same in the meeting they had thesame level of visual and audioexperience when you go into an officespace you have this unequal plane wherethe people in the office have a singlevideo stream and the people that areremote are struggling to see who's inthe space who's saying what what thereactions are Etc so creating thatEquitable meeting experience is is theopportunity that we have and thistechnologies that we have such as ourGoogle series one room system that'swhat it was designed to do is to try todeliver a more actionable experience andthat meeting room space so when you comeback in the office you're not having anytype of trade-off remote participantsare able to be seen and heard people inthe office are be able to be seen andheard and it's an actionable experienceacross the boardit's almost like the office is behindthe virtual experiences rightwhat about you Dan you know it'sinteresting I think we've all seen thisreally dramatic shift in how people workand I don't think any of us think thatthat's going to be isolated to just afew years post pandemic it's probablyhere to stay and so as we engage withour customers we've noticed you knowseveral Trends and maybe I'll just capoff on three of them real quick like thefirst thing that we're seeing is duringthe pandemic you saw these I.T teams inparticular do you know amazing things toenable their workforces and the amountof change that was introduced and whatthey had to do you know they were doingthings in you know two or three daysthat they would have taken months oryears to do to just enable their teamsnow what we're seeing is that they'regoing back and they're having torationalize all those decisions they'retrying to figure out how do theystreamline their Tech stack how do theysimplify their spend and reduce theirspend how do they increase productivityand they're looking to do that bystandardizing on their softwareportfolio uh so that's one Trend thesecond term we're seeing of course tiesto hybrid work and we're going to talk alot about that today but they're tryingto figure out what is our approach tohybrid work how do we enable our teamshow do we facilitate hybrid work in away that we don't lose the creativityand The Innovation that we can keepteams together and connected and alignedas they go through their work togetherand so they're looking for solutions tomake sure the teams are equipped in away to continue to facilitate that andthen the third Trend that that I'llbring up today really comes toum you know why while companies tend tobe as Innovative and really push theenvelope on Innovation as much as everbefore their tolerance for failure inthat Innovation process seems lower thanever before and so they're looking forhow do we help our teams of knowledgeworkers to be able tomore reliably predict you know what arethe Investments what are the projectsthat are going to succeed and they'regoing to win they're going to help us toyou know quickly execute and be able toyou know maintain or gain market shareor be able to create a new Revenuestream or be able to create that reallydelightful customer experience and do itin a way where there's likely lessfailure in the process and and thesecross-functional teams they needsolutions that help them to get thoseproducts to Market or their Solutionsout to their to their Workforce fasterand be able to do that all the way fromlike the earliest idea through to ournow it's a reality and so Lucid isleading in across the board with ourcustomers and our partners to try andsolve all those problems uh uh you knowa little bit for us to dothe bar is definitely higher and I thinkthat's a good thingokay so hybrid workum Brian we're going to start with youuh how many companies have remote andand on-site as you talked about how canmeeting Technology support effectivecollaboration we are behind there's away there's a need to update the officesto have better Technologies in theoffice what strategies do you recommendfor organizations and how can companiesprovide flexibility boost engagementFoster better connectionsyeah so great questionum on that so as I stated before meetingEquity is the key opportunity all rightand you know we're looking to bringtechnology forward to help address thisthrough leveraging Ai and both audio andvideo experience that is delivered forboth the remote and the localparticipants now first we'll talk aboutvideo so you know at the very basiclevel with video AI we're doing thingssuch as identifying things in the roomsuch as white boards we're identifyingthe whiteboards we're Keystone applyingKeystone and image correction andenhancement to those white boards andwe're passing that over through video tothe remote participants so they can seewhat's going on in that room and feellike they're part of that room and thatexperience but that's just the firststep you know the next step from a videostandpoint as I said before was how dowe take that single video stream of aroom where you might have somebodysitting 15 feet away from the camera atthe end of the table and that personmight be the most important person inthe room the leader in the room and howdo we take that experience and enhancethat while we're doing that throughreally doing multiple video streams sowe can take a single video stream we canstart to enhance that and providemultiple video streams so individuals inthe room can start to be pulled out andpresented in an individual video streamto the remote participants that allowsthose remote participants to be able tomore easily see what's going on in theroom the reactions of the people in theroom to things they may be saying orwhat other people may be saying bringingagain those remote participants into theroomthat's on a video side and on audio sideuh again we're looking to leverage AI toenhance the audio experience again forremote participants how do we use audioAI to remove background noise rightannoying things such as keyboardsclicking bags crunching backgroundconversations that might be happening ina more open uh meeting environmentthat's actually a leadership positionthat we have with Google series onewe've got some of the best capabilitieson audio filtering so that those remoteparticipants aren't distracted by thesebackground noises and they're able tohear clearly what's going on the meetingengage with people in the meeting thenext step of it is using AI to alignspatial audio so you know we are allused to that Brady Bunch view that wesee of a meeting space with with peopleyou know scattered throughout on theboard and we've all had that experiencewhen we've been our home office wheresomebody starts speaking we're searchingthroughout that Brady Bunch board forwho is it is talking well withpositional audio when you have thatscreen at the front of the room inside ameeting room you can start to have aright hand side speaker matched to aright hand side person as that personstarts speaking the audio comes out ofthere the audio is a clear view to youto turn your head and engage your eyesin the direction of that to help helpthe people in the room better understandwho's speaking and and provide a littlebit less confusion in that experience sothe implementation of these Technologiesreally creates a more collaborativeengaging work experience helps to makeemployees have a better overallexperience and be more productiveoverallthanksand how do you think about hybrid workyeah I mean uh it's a combination youknow all the stuff that Brian and hiscompany is doing to like facilitate thatum you know the video conference thecommunication that part thecommunication is one side collaborationis another part of it and they they kindof work hand in hand and and I think youknow the old ways that people work tothe old ways that people collaboratedum were really dependent on doing thingsexclusively in person uh and and I thinkthat you know during the pandemic therewas this really rapid rate of changethat put a lot of pressure on thesecollaboration patterns uh and and itreally brought uh to the Forefront a lotof things that were broken that maybe wehad just become numb to or we'd gottenused to and then suddenly it doesn'twork anymore uh and so I think a lot ofthat pain comes down to a reallyfundamental problem which is that uhlanguage whether it's written or spokenlanguage is imprecise and so humansspend a lot of time trying to understandeach other and we've come up with allthese ways over time to try and augmentthat communication so whether that'sriding on a cave wall or riding on awhiteboard which are remarkably similarbehaviorsseparated by thousands of years rightbut uh but there's really really similarbehaviors or we get into the same roomso that we can see each other's bodylanguage or we you know create a visualand we get in the same room it's thatpattern of the past was like just sodependent on being at this in the sametime the same place with somebody so wecould have that visual experiencetogether to augment the communication sovisual collaboration you know is asolution for that it goes beyond thatand it helps teams so they can worktogether visually we often talk about itas side by side on the same canvaswhether that's in real time orasynchronously regardless of wherethey're located at in the world and soit's a fantastic solution for bridgingthose gaps and it's one of the mainreasons behind our Lucid spark webadd-on for Google meme it enables usersto collaborate together during any calland really pretty much any meeting thata team is involved with you know aworkshop or meeting a session is goingto be improved if they you know do someplanning ahead of time on this canvas ifthey facilitate and then do follow-up ona shared canvas together is going toenhance that experience for them so thevisual collaboration enables teams in ahybrid work environment to be able tocommunicate and collaborate and the waythat they work best that's visually andit supports teams not just in thatupfront ideating but really it needs tosupport them on that entire Journey fromthe earliest idea all the way throughreality so we often think about thisidea to reality journey and how we needto support hybrid work throughout thatwhole journeythanks Dan Thomas you're in a slightlydifferent space than uh Dan's world buthow do you think about hybrid work yeswell I think I mean first of all withoutmeeting Equity there is no hybrid workand collaboration as as Dan was sharinghand in hand with that but I I will Iguess take our conversation to thinkabout communication and meeting atdifferent scales and at brandlive wereally think about the importance oflarge scale meetings so that might be adepartment-wide it might be acompany-wide it might just be a newpresentation or a meaningfulpresentation introducing Concepts thatare meant to align the audience orenergize the audience and thoseoccasions in a hybrid sense are are evenmore important than ever before becauseyou have folks who are not in the sameplace the energy in the room is not aconcept that exists when you have halfof the attendees joining on a video calland so we would really you know wereally push our customers and ourpartners to invest in those occasionswhen they will be presenting to abroader audience and and the benefitsare are multiple but a couple benefitsare you know they it's those occasionsand the quality that you put forwardwhen you're engaging the entire companyit sets sets the tone for thecommunication that should happenunderneath inside the organization andthey also help to create the right Focuswe're distributed we're hybrid and sothose come together those times when wehave the opportunity to create alignmentwe need to invest in those occasions andand make sure that they stand out fromthe day to day whether we're talkingabout you know a typical hour-longpresentation or whether we're breakingmeetings into shorter chunks meant to beconsumedsynchronously we need to be thinkingabout making meeting content in thoselarger occasions that's worth watchingit can't look like this this is it can'tlook like a recording of a stand-up or arecording of the meeting that everybodyjust clicked over from when there's amore important message when there's abroader audience it's it's important toinvest in that in the hybrid sensebecause those opportunities to leveragefocus and Alignment across theorganization are more more important asfolks are spread across differentlocationsokaylast topicAI for meetingswe're going to start with Dio Danumcan businesses use AI for meetingswhat's already availablehow does AI evolve the way we meet andcommunicate and what does it enable forthe futureyeah so I mean the short answer is yesyes they can use itum uh and then there's obviously alonger answer uh in thereum but it's it's been fascinating to seethe evolution of AI like so rapidly andas I've watched it and and seen what'shappening it's like there's this Coregroup of entities that are evolving andBuilding Things uh at the core like llmslike Bard right that then there's awhole another ecosystem that's buildingon top of that really rapidly and as Ilook at it it's funny because sometimesI see all the experiments happening ontop of these llms I'm like it kind oflooks like random acts of AI like it'snot I like like it's not alwayscomprehensive or holistic or evenmeaningful at timesum but that's that's the nature ofexperimentation right that's the natureof Rapid learning so so it's okay andthen we are starting to see sweet spotsthough where like AI is doing reallyreally well for example one of the usecases that we see and that you'veprobably all experienced is is AI isgreat at summarizing content like it'slike home run every time that I use itfor that and so that's that can be asummary during or after a meeting rightthat it does that at least the way thatwe're thinking about it you know werecently released our first beta of aseries of features we call collaborativeAi and our customers seem to appreciatethat the way we did it wasn't random itwas focused on one really specificworkflow it was on this workflow how doyou help a team in their brainstormprocess so with from the earliest partof ideation to kind of synthesizing thethoughts summarizing that contentturning it into actionable insights so acomplete workflow assisted by AI to helpa team get through it and we thinkthere's a lot more that we can do thatway that will help teams in the contextof meetings or in their day-to-day workand and we kind of Chunk it into fourcategories the first of course isgenerative AI which we're all used toand the use case there in a lucidcontext is you could say or write someprompt that would basically say Hey youknow an example would be the last promptI did was uh you know show me a diagramof how to determine where eligibility inthe United States and it could justgenerate that for you wouldn't that benice and uh and so so that's one exampleof the generative then we go to acategory we call assistive and anassistive is interesting you can almostthink of it as where AI becomes the userinterface and so it's like you've gotsome set of contentand instead of like the old school waywhich is the old school is as a team oras an individual I have to go and clickaround the user interface and figure outwhere stuff is and and invoke differentfeatures and capabilities the new waywith assistive AI in there is is I justsay something like heyum get all of the cards uh move themover to the right the ones that are atrisk make them red the ones that are ontarget make them green and thenprioritize them you know order them byparty and it would just do all thatthose are all things you could domanually if you knew where to click butit can just do that for you so it's likeit's becoming the assistant it's it'svery intuitive that way the the thirdbucket we talk about as interrogativeand interrogative is like this querypattern where where the answer to yourquestion is explicitly found on thatCanvas OR in the data associated withthat canvas and so you can ask aquestion like hey how many seniorEngineers are working on our most mostimportant project and the AI couldanswer that question for you explicitlythere's a discrete answer to thatquestion and then the fourth book wethink about is inferential Ai and youcan imagine this in a team setting maybethe AI is participating in the meetingwith you and so as a team you're askingquestions and maybe you come up with aquestion together in that meeting of howmight we speed up this process and theinferential AI I'd like the answer tothat question isn't explicitly found onthe canvas you're working on or in thedata Associated but could be inferredwith some analysis or some logic appliedand so what that might look like is howmight we speed up this process by 10percent it's going to go it's going tofind the likely constraints in thatprocess look for common ways to offsetthose bottlenecks come back with a fewrecommendations and what the likelyimpact and outcome of thoseimplementations would be on this processthat's a pretty sophisticated thing foran AI to be able to do so that's theinferential Ai and we think all thosethings are attainable and all this canhappen in the meeting context they canhappen you know as I work individuallygo through it and that's that's kind ofour you know how we think about theworld and how we drive it forward andmake it really tangible for peoplethat sounds amazingumokay Thomas yeah agreed amazing I thinkI'll try to build on that answer a bitwe we may be entering well I think weare entering a period where some of thethe technologies that were justmentioned do apply to the meetingcontext we six months ago or 12 monthsago we were in a world where a lot of AIproducts were coming out and it wasn'tquite clear what's meaningful what'sapplicable and now we're getting to atime where we we can think about AIapplied to the context of meeting andcollaboration and the lens I would urgefolks to think about is quality and sowhen we think about bringing AI to themeeting context how can we increase thequality of the communication happeninghow can we raise the bar in terms ofwhat the experience is like inside ofthose meetings and it can be done in afew ways and these are just thoughtstarters butI would break it down into before themeeting or prep during the meeting asyou're actively in conversation orcollaboration and then after the meetingin terms of what why did we have themeeting what's supposed to happen infollow-up and so if we look at beforethe meeting I think generative AI is isa slam dunk here we can prepare morethoughtful more meaningful presentationmaterial we can actually lean on AI toplan meetings ahead of time and keep ushonest in terms of the agendas that weare running through as a group when wedo spend that valuable time together andso pre-meeting I think the toolsavailable to us on a generative AI basisand some of the cool pieces that we sawfrom duet AI earlier in the week offermeeting hosts and attendees theopportunity to improve the inputs to themeeting and then once folks get thereand they're in the room I thinkthe idea of bringing AI to create betterfocus in the room it is really a big oneand we heard about AI to improve meetingEquity we also have seen this week Ithink awesome examples of improvingimage and sound quality to have a moretrue conversation with those folksyou're in conversation with and thenwhat got me excited across this week wasseeing a lot of the updates to automatedmeeting notes automated meetingsummarization these tools that giveparticipants confidence to be fullypresent in a meeting in conversation andcomfortable knowing that they're notgoing to miss they're not going to missanything and so I think enabling thosetools for employees is is a big piece ofhelping to drive quality inside themeeting experience with AI and it allleads to you know this notes commentkind of takes us to after the meeting weshould be leaning on these tools to keepus accountable we don't want to behaving meetings the classic meetingwhere a day later people follow up anddon't know why they why we met or whatwe're supposed to do next we should beleaning on AI to keep us accountable andhopefully you know that that experienceof getting feedback from your meeting ina Punchy and Powerful way does trainpeople toum you know come back to the front ofthat cycle I just discussed and put moreeffort into The Upfront preparation andthe rest will followthe AI is training us a little bitall right Brian how do you think aboutAi and mediaso you know Dan painted a great pictureof kind of the art of the possible of AIand you know Thomas was talking about acouple different aspects and I'm goingto latch on to one specifically the postmeeting aspectum so you know transcription issomething that's been around uh for alittle while uh with full remoteparticipants but again as we have thishybrid environment we start to pullpeople back into the officetranscription has some challenges withinside a meeting room where you havemultiple people and identifying who'sactually saying what right attributingwhat's being said to who's saying itwith inside that meeting room and that'swhere AI is coming in again that videoin the audio AI we're leveraging theaudio to understand the direction thatsomething's being said we're leveragingvideo to look in that direction identifywho that is that's actually saying thatand then attribute that to them uh thatperson in the in the transcription ofthat meeting but that's you know that'shappening right now the next step ofthat is applying large language modelum and and some of the the capabilitiesthat Dan spoke aboutum how do we take that transcription andhow do we make it relevant to people whoaren't in that meeting uh so for exampleif your manager was in meeting and yourmanager was talking about something youprobably want to know what it was theywere saying especially if there wereaction itemsum and ownership uh items that werecoming out of that that your managermight have said heyso and so on my team will take that wellyou really want to know that and youwant to avoid a potentially embarrassingsituation where you were identified asan owner of an action item and maybeyour manager forgot to tell you that Iknow that's never happened to anyonebefore but that's where AI can help in asituation like that but that's just thetip of the icebergwith AI if we know who's saying what andwe can use AI from a video standpoint toactually understand engagement orsentiment on someone's face whensomething's being said so if you comparethose two things together you can startto use AI in a proactive way to educateemployees right to to proactively letthem know after a presentation that theyprovided or a meeting that they weretalking in and presenting or puttingforward an idea you can actually letthem know potentially let them know whatuh what was the reaction of some of thepeople in the room to some of the thingsthey said and then potentially whatcould be a more effective way to presentthat idea right so then we're taking Aiand we're using AI to actually helpimprove our employees communication andby improving the employee'scommunication we make more effectivemore productive employees overall sothat's the next step that's theevolution of where we're seeing AI inthe meeting room space Brad justimagining a snore scoreI hope you don't do that well you know Iif if I was putting someone to sleep Ithink I'd rather have ai tell me thatthan my manager so okay there arePartners who are building things likethat for sure like on our platform we'reseeing Partners who are analyzing likeyou just said people's um engagementlevel what their facial expressions areand I did hear if you're moving yourhead more that it's like your audienceis engaged versus like if there's reallystill on video it means they're doingother thingsum great thank youum well thank you Thomas Ryan Dan forall of your Insight it's reallyinteresting to hear the differentperspectives you guys have I know you'rein different parts of the business andbut sort of all sort of working ondifferent elements of meeting and soit's it's great to hear your latestthoughts on thatumthere is more you can check out on theworkspace Marketplace online Danmentioned Lucid has a bunch of add-onsthere a lot of our partners are in themarketplace there and there are alsodemos I know the expo hall is closingout butum there are some demos you can ask tosee as well for some of our partnershere so please go down and check thatout please give a land of a pause to ourpanelists todaythank youthank you for joining us and we'll bearound if you would like to talk"
