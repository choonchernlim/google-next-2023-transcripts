I'm really delighted towork in this industry which I think isthe best industry in the worldthere's many reasons for that the famethe fortune the glamorand I can't imagine anywhere else whereyou could create barberheimerthe global phenomenon of Barbie andOppenheimerso I'm going to spend the next fiveminutes setting the scene just giving aview of what we're seeing in the marketand how Google cloud is helping totransform your businessesso it's no surprisethat's streamingis boominghow many streaming apps do you thinkthere are globally I'm going to ask abit of audience participation here 50.actually I'm going to give a prizewhoever gets it gets this limitededition Google Cloud padwhat's that51 higher higher100.who said 200.there's over 200 in Worlds there you goI promise he wasn't a plan okayum how many households uh how manysubscriptions you have in your householdif you have more than four put your handupwowyou're perfectly normalthe average household has four or moresubscriptionsand with that comes a lot of expense buta lot of power so you have the power toswitchwhich means media companies have tospend billions of dollars creatingcontent to keep youa really good example is Ted lassoso in the UKum I haven't got the stats but I know alot of people subscribe to Apple TV justto watch Ted lassoit's actually filmed in my hometown ofRichmond so if you come to London let meknow I'll give you a personal tour TedLotto tool freeum but yes streaming is here to stayand we're seeing just fantasticallylots of pressure consumer expectationswanting more personalization morerecommendations more interaction thiscombined with the macroeconomicconditions cost of living crisis rightto strike you know all of this is comingtogether to put a lot of pressure onmedia companiesand marketing have got multipleplatforms now to try and attract andbetraying customers so with thatcomplexity this is where technology canreally affect the business outcomesand if you can provide personalizationin real timewe can see a 50 increase in CustomerLoyalty it's very powerfulour mission at Google cloud is to helpmedia companies on your transformationjourney to in to improve your audienceexperiences through innovationI've been told I get a nickel every timeI mention gen AIum sothere's lots of areas of focus forinvestmentand there's three areas of innovationthat we see ourselves play one iscreation so content creation one isdistribution how to distribute contentto relevant audiencesand the other is engagement how toengage your audience and get moremonetizationa good example top of mind is Tick Tockso two years ago it was a billion dollarcompany now it's nearly 10 billionthe subscribers the average subscriberspends one and a half hours a dayscrolling through short form video whichisjust phenomenal and so we want to workwith Innovative companies you see somehere I've got some that I'm going tointroduce to you in a momentwhere we can really help accelerate thatjourney to transformationthis four main solution pillars well welook at to Future proof and innovate inyour businessthe first one is around increasingcontent productionthe next one delivering cloud enabledlive broadcast experiences thenstreaming transformation and thencreating more value with data and AIand we see some really top use casescoming out of thoseso some examples here but these are theones that we've been working with inyour industry to either save costsincrease enablementincrease revenue streamsso anything fromthe um VFX rendering to production thecloudtoum multi-cloudmulti-cloud management and then also ofcourse data and Ai and therecommendation AIsupercharging the personalizationJourneyso the nickel slide that's gen AIhow can we work with you to accelerateso perhaps things that you're doingalready using gen AI whether it be incontent creationin the personalization of audienceexperiences or improving monetizationand getting more revenue streams to hiton all those challenges that I talkedabout at the beginningso I think this is the perfect moment tointroduce my guests we've got twofantastic real-life clients Paramountand Fox Sports who are going to talkwith Anil about their Journey using genAi and the cloud thank you[Applause]foreignit's a good crowdthey're here for you I can feel theenergy it's not quite Taylor Swift crowdyeah anyway good to see you all thankyou thank you Juliaum so my name is Anil Jain I lead ourstrategic consumer Industries at GoogleCloudum now which spans media andentertainment games retail and cpg happyto talk to you about all of those butwe're here for media and entertainmentwhich I spent the bulk of my time atGoogle Cloud building up uh with mygreat colleagues here in the audienceand with a number of you in the audienceas wellI have the distinct pleasure of havingthese two gentlemen both his colleaguesand Friends uh and so we're going tojust Dive Right into a conversationum we do have a mic here so after we gothrough a little bit ofdialogue uh sharing insights on andperspectives on the applications Ai andmedia and entertainment now and in thefuture uh we're happy to open it up toquestionsum and then we always have plenty totalk about so even if you don't havequestions we'll keep going so maybe whatwe can do is fill if you would start offand then go to Dustin just introduceyourselfyour role responsibility company andthen uh maybe spend a little bit of timeon areas of AI application in yourbusiness right now and that way we kickit off and we can dive into questionsafterwards great yeah again hi everybodyI'm Phil wiser I run technology andoperations at Paramount which is acollection of media assets and Brandsyou would recognize like CVSclearly we've got Paramount Pictures andour Paramount plus and Pluto streamingservices showtime and then a largecollection of Brands like MTV ComedyCentral and then many recognizablebrands on the franchise level SpongeBobbeing one of my favorites andYellowstone obviously being in theZeitgeist of popular culture right nowand we we brought all these companies totogether really about four years agowhat was initially Viacom CBS when wemerged them and then rebranded that allto be Paramount and we work across thetraditional businesses and the streamingbusinesses to create you know technologyand operational ecosystem that can scaleup to deliver these experiences whetherit's going to a traditional provider orgoing through one of our streamingplatforms or somebody else's streamingplatformsum as we're all you know continuing todiversify our business so it's really aninteresting dynamic in the industryright now where we were focused on hypergrowth of streaming and now we're reallyfocused on continued growth of streamingbut also you know getting the economicsof the business right-sized reallyaround production which is where wespend the bulk of our money productionof content and marketing so we'relooking at that and then AI is somethingwe've had in our culture for quite along time we had an applied machinelearning group back at CVS actually atCBS Interactive probably in the 2016time frame and that group has built allthe recommendation systems that go intoParamount plus and increasingly intoother services like Pluto but we havealso in in what I was jokingly referringto as OG AIum you know the 2017 era AI where youcould go in and do object recognitionand things like that and I saw the democongrats on the keynote of Fox Sportsbut just pulling images out so we couldidentify those for things like editingand then you know identifying new assetsthat we want to get get at but we'reusing that also to create Snippets orsummaries so when you Mouse over anasset in the UI at Paramount plus that15 or 30 second reel is generated byMachine learning and it was a human inthe loop obviously to make sure itrepresents what we want but we've beenapplying that and now as we get into genAI which will be the interesting topictoday we can take all that to the nextlevel particularly around production youabsolutely and by the way this is aboutAi and media entertainment so it couldbe OG AI or gen AI because I thinkhonestly uh the applications ofartificial intelligence machine learningin driving transformation media andentertainment are quite significant andvaried so feel free to touch upon andall of it yeah I'm uh I'm Dustin Myers Irun production operations for Fox Sportswe are the home of the NFL World Seriesand the FIFA World Cup and I focus a loton using AI for Content production thoseof you who saw our keynote yesterday yousaw what the great job you guys didshowing off what we call the intelligentasset service which is the isit has taken our entire Library dumpedin basically 27 28 years of Fox Sportsand it's basically what weaffectionately call Fox YouTube so wecan find more or less anything we wantin there and it enhances our group sowhere we're at now though is we'relooking at well what's next right rightso it's it's Ai and we've used OG AI aswell right you know we trained models onwhat's a touchdown what's a home runwhere are all these different componentsand it's enabled us to find our media ifyou're a Storyteller that's that's itright it's the ingredients of findingthe right shop finding the right clipfinding the right emotion that you needto tell your story but we're trying totake it to another place now we'retrying to take it to how do we enhanceour creatives how do we give them thetools across the globe to tell storiesdifferently and I think that's wherethat's where gen AI comes in is wherewe're trying to create not replacepeople but create a collaborationpartner for production that you now havetool sets that will do the first fewsteps for you or get you down thecreative path in a way that you haven'tbeforethank you both for being here appreciateit by the way how many of you watchedthe keynote yesterday and saw the FoxSports demothat's something that that we spent along time working on and we're prettyproud of so I'm happy to see how manypeople saw thatum you know Juliet put up a slideearlier that identified you know what Ilike to refer to as kind of the threelenses you know of how you look at theapplications of generative AI but thetruth is those are the same lenses you'duse for traditional you know existing Aiand machine learning as well that waspre-generativebecause fundamentally the application ofgenerative AI also has to still conformto driving the same kpis that a businessand media an entertainment company needsto uh needs care about so just as areminder those where you know contentcreation production and management rightwhich is what both of you have spokenabout enabling more engaging andpersonalized experiences because I thinkyou know the North Star in many casesfor media and entertainment is aboutincreasingly hyper personalization ofexperience is and we can talk aboutgenerative AI we can debate that onebecause I think people have gone alittle off the rails on that but that'llbe fine okay I'm gonna be happy actuallydebate would be greatum and then third of course isincreasing enhancing monetization solet's start first in the production areabecause you both have touched upon thatso just continue to spend a little moretime detailing what exactly happens wellhow about how about we do it this waytalk about the before State and then thecurrent state and if you could uh maybeunderscore why that's important in termsof value for the business becauseultimately we can all work on incrediblescience and technology projects but theyhave to affect the business in a waythat creates value at least value thatis understood and perceived regardlessof whether it's quantifiable or not yeahno I mean that's a good point you make Imean we started off with an attitude ofwell let's change how people work we hadan Antiquated system and I'll take youthrough it because someone will laugh ifyou worked at Fox Sports you know in inyou know 2010 and you were trying to doa piece let's let's pick World Cup youwant to do a story on Messi and youwanted to find material for him well youwould you know you could go into ourexisting ma'am and you could try to findit and you'd get about you knowthousands of clips that were named dateand some other long titles and youwouldn't know what it was and then you'dgo to YouTube and you'd find out whatyou were looking for and then you'd getthe key date and then you'd go back tothe Mammon eventually you'd find it it'dtake a while thoughum and so what we did is we went outinto the into the marketplace and wewent to NAB like anyone else and wetalked to everyone there there was like33 companies my team's over here and Iknow they're laughing about this but umwe talked to everyone we could and andno one could do it so we went to Googleand you guys said sure let's try thisand why that's important is like whenyou make afeature film like these guys do or youdo pre-game shows like we do or any kindof content you don't ever really finishyou run out of time and you run out ofmoney right yeah and what enabled us isnow that we've taken the whole Libraryput it in run the machine learning on ituse speech to text and use all theassociative things you can search for aperson and a person that comes up youknow for our ad sales team you cansearch for you know a truck and a talentand it comes up which is all wonderfullyuseful but what it's really done thevalue in it is it has it has made thatthe finding of material which was a hugehurdle for us it's more or less takingit away and hats off to our team who'vedone this so you've taken processes thatwere two days two weeks to two hours twominutes and the value in that is it'schanged how we work you no longer sitback and say well we am we don't haveenough time to do that because you youcan and I think it it's it's changed ourbusiness in a way that we didn't seecoming we knew it would be good we knewwe would you know we would affect thesupply chain to an extent but we didn'tsee is that it would affect the companythat now the Marketing Group can come inand they have access to our contentExecutives no matter where they are inthe world can can access our content wecan all collaborate on that contentbecause of what we've doneyeah amazing you know just uh somethingyou said a couple times and there isaboutchanging the way you work and you knowobviously you can't walk around GoogleCloud next or talk to anybody in cloudand not talk about the wordtransformation right and sofundamentally when you think aboutbusiness transformation or digitaltransformationthe definition I like best is reallyabout reimagining the way you work rightthe way the business operates and sothis is a classic example of exactlythat right where you're changing the wayin which many functions within thebusiness operate and we'll talk a littlebit about where you think that can go Iwas going to just build on somethingjust a second I think it's reallyimportant what you didn't know was goingto come out of the process right rightand we talk about emergent properties ofthese systems maybe we call theseemergent outcomes but you really I thinkyou know to getting momentum within thecompany around this you have to developa belief system that this is really goodand we know that really good things aregoing to happen we're not going to go inand analyze exactly how many hours ofsomeone's day is going to be safe bydoing it yeah because it's really kindof a waste of time but you need to go inand understand like it's not a scienceexperiment it gets to the core of peopledoing work and that's what we're tryingto do you know across Paramount analysisget the tools in the hands of the peoplethat are doing this work and thenobserve what comes out of it and I thinkthat's that's really important because Isee a lot of people get hung up ondigging into specific use cases goingreally deep on analysis and the Market'sgoing to move past them while we'redeploying these tools you know I'm goingto diverge fromthe direction we were going just becauseof something you said Phil so uh wouldbe really I think useful for not justthis crowd but pretty much anybody who'sin this uh who's at the conference todaysomething you said right there isgetting moving forward withouthaving the Precision or theuh expected Precision of what theoutcome is going to be right becausethere will be emergent outcomes thereare things it's like when I uh I wasspeaking to a reporter yesterday andasked you know where what would be yourone piece of advice to a company thathasn't started their Cloud Journey onwhere to start I said you start with thedata right but because you don't knowwhat's going to come of it until you'veactually started to organize acollecting you have a lot of ideas butyou don't really know until you do it soin that type of scenariowe're all Technologies here running youknow functional you know variousfunctions of businesses throughout ourcareers how do you convince the CFOthat you need to make these Investmentswhen there isn't a clear value equationor assessment or economic model or Roithat can be calculated I don't alwaysconvince them and I think that's reallyimportant but but we'll move ahead withit because we know that the outcome isgoing to be there but in all seriousnesslike we go in with some of these andreally try and identify small bats thatwe can make without needing that levelof precision in the output to say lookit's a relatively small bet we're goingto do this and then we're going to learnand then just like a good venturecapitalist will increase the next roundswhen we see the results in the previousround and we try to do that in all ofour investments but for the bigger oneslet's say we want to take our wholearchive right and convert that which isnot a trivial effort it's prettystraightforward to put rough numbers inthere and identify pain points and justyou know looking historically at thingswe've already done with previousTransformations and I referenced thecloud quite a bit because it's a greatparallel we had the same exactconversation replace AI with cloud yeahhow do you convince your CFO that movingto the cloud is going to be better andyou know we know what happened tocompanies that spent three years youknow wringing their hands trying toanalyze every potential outcome they gotleft behind and ended up doing anotherspin of a capital investmentdepreciation cycle while the rest of uswere running and operating that way theother thing I do in getting away fromjust the financial analysis is alsolooking it through the lens of thestartup if I was going into the businesstoday as a startup and wanted to operatethis how would I do it would I hire abunch of people to go in and tag thoseimages or scenes or would I be applyingAI obviously you know you'd be applyingAi and we've run everything in the cloudso I think that kind of mentality issaying how would I do it today to becompetitive with someone that's going toeat my lunch coming into the market issomewhat convincing from a fearperspective It's very effective but I doyou know I think I'm not downplayinganalytics I obsess over dollars everyday but I think you just have to balancethat out with strategyI think though it that's your point ofif you started your journey here I thinkthere's a few things we learned is tryto create an environment where peopleare not afraid to fail it's not becausebecause I think this is a this is ashift this is not about like look we putit we start using Ai and we're gonna youknow these assistants Are Gonna Savethree hours a day I think it's that'sthat's the wrong way to look at ityou're investing in people and sayingwe're going to take the mundane tasksand maybe take them off your hands andwe're also going to take tasks that youcan't do and see if we can help you dothem and then you're going to focus onthe human work in the middle and you'regoing to get better and better and us asa brand will get better because of thatCollective effort I don't think it'sthis traditional Roi model to your pointlike there's a certain amount of like wecan go down this path of the of thedepreciative investment or we can try togo this way and invest in our people andour brand well building on that too it'simportant to go after where you spendmost of your money which is why when wewere looking at it Paramount we saidfocus on production that's where wespend the large largest amount ofcapital every year creating content andwe know there's a lot of painfulprocesses involved in inefficientprocesses involved in the billions ofdollars that we put into that content sowhen you enter and like hey if we getyou know a a incremental Improvementagainst that very large number obviouslyit's worth making a relatively smallinvestment yeah yeah that makes a lotthank you both for sharing that Phil inParamount focusing on production whichobviously you know tremendousspan of of work that gets done inParamount to serve kind of multipleendpoints if you will in distributionchannels where do you think the greatestopportunities lie to leverage AI in theproduction pipeline and and by the wayis it pre-productionwell let's start with what works today Imean you know we know that transferlearning or deep fakes work so we lookat those things we know work todayreally well and figure out where thathits or production pipeline clearlydubbing and subbing where you're tryingto take the tone or style of an originalvoice and have that go into a differentlanguage is a great application so a lotof people in the industry are looking atglobalization as an opportunity andglobalization is not just dubbing andsubbing it's also different edits fordifferent markets based on standards orcultural issues which takes a lot oftime so that's I think a quick win thateverybody's looking at right now themundane editing work like going in anddoing image correction or creatingobjects replacing objects or changingstyle those are all things that thetechnology does really well right now soI think that's huge where I think a lotof people have gotten you know offcourse is this Green Field videogeneration where AI is going to generatea new episode or a new feature filmanyone that's played around with itknows that you get three or so secondsof video and then a bunch of peopleStitch those three seconds together andyou get a video that kind of looks likemost of the other AI generated videosfor the most for the most part like it'sgoing to get there yeah but I think thatbeing pragmatic about what works todayand then applying that to the businessthat's what I'm most energized about andwe've got examples like this that wehave on The Late Show with Colbert oneof our editors had to do a quick turnbecause they do the day of news they gettogether in the early afternoon generateideas and then hey there's a bit we'regoing to have a three minute episode andthe editors furiously go and try and getit done in six hours and sometimesthey're like I just can't do that intime and we had one example where wejust had to place this Ben and Jerry'sice cream character and a bunch of funnyscenes which normally was a lot oflinear editing work that took five tosix hours this editor did it in 10minutes with an off-the-shelf tool sothose kind of proof points are where youwin the hearts and minds of the peoplethat are in the creative Community Ithink it's really as you said Dustinimportant I always tack back to thecreative community and what they'rereally going to embrace what's going tomake their life betterawesomeJustin you've spent all this time youand the team and and we know it well inthe trenches making you know this thisbeautiful solution work with startingwith 27 petabytes of content and tens ofthousands of hours of footage everymonth to do exactly what you explainedearlier and you also do a lot ofcollaboration across Fox Sports onworkspaceand you know which of course a lot ofannouncements this week as well on thatbut if you look at kind of the startingpoint as the intelligent asset servicewhich it fundamentally allows you knowAi and ml based search and workspacewhere do you seeum uh this is kind of a loaded questionbecause I know you have a very longroadmapum but where do you seeum future opportunities that are reallyexciting to apply generally AI on top ofthe work you guys have already doneI mean I think I think for me and andit's things that you know we kick aroundin the The Art of what's possible butwe're here and we're talking about itI'd like to train the mom I would liketo get models that we that know what'sfunny know what's sad and I'd like tostart start like take it from aninterviewand run a model on it and have it parseout the parts of the interview thatmatch a criteria I'd love you know tohave our producers write a script andanalyze it for what and score a song tomatch it you know and to really createsomething from the data we already havebecause like you think about when youhave your in your entire Library more orless there why can't you take and yousaid workspaces like why can you startto point instead of the royalty-freelibrary that slides uses point it atyour library right and as your marketingteams are looking to create materialsand instead of you know oh I need a shotof create it or or pull from yourlibrary to enhance it and start learningyour style for your company I mean lookwhat what is the UI of the IIs it's justa portal into our library what's workworkspaces was described earlier todayso as a portal into gen AI for a duetbasically right that's all these shouldbe is portals into something so maybe westart combining those abilities and yourcontent can just be the building blocksand AI is the tool to help you get toplaces you couldn't go beforeyeah I was just going to build on thatactually because I do think what you hiton you know there's a challenge for allmedia companies with a scale oflibraries you know how are we going tobuild our models that are proprietaryyes and and really take advantage ofthose get higher Fidelity outputs basedon our existing IP to generate new IPand we're all trying to figure that outlike do we go with you knowoff-the-shelf existing models andfine-tune them do we build net newmodels I mean that that to me is goingto be a really interesting Evolutionover the next couple years to figure outwhat's the right architecture and thenyou know how are we going to you knowturn that into a usable tool within thecompany yeah I I mean I we literallythis morning had a conversation with anumber of media and gaming executivesand some consumer uh companies as wellabout this very topicum and I think that you know there is noSilver Bullet here right there's a lotof experimentation and exploration thathas to happen and you know this is alsofundamentally why we you know you oftenhear me say we don't believe in onemodel to rule them all right there's awhole range of models that can beutilizedum you know fit for purposeum based on performance accuracyproprietary data and then the ability ofcourse to train your own models rightbased on the rights that you havewhether you own the assets or not ofcourse the agreements with you know uhlicensors will also change accordinglyum so before we go into questionsbecause I'm sure we have a fewumjust a couple more real quickuh you touched on something that I wasgoing to ask you and you said it earlierpart ofum part of the the worlds that you guyslive in right because you're in verylargeestablished top 10 vertically integratedmedia companies that have you knowproduction through distribution rightum you know linear as well as live aswell as digital and more rightum and uh part of what the capabilitiesthat have just been announced you knowthis last year with General AI part ofwhat they enable is this democratizationof you know a Content generation as wellas the availability of capabilities thatyou know most small companies orindividuals could not previously accessright that's the dream in many caseswhat is the attitude you have at Foxmaybe and then we'll go to Paramount onthe landscape and whether there aregoing to bestartups and other companies that comein and move faster and provide you knowcompetitive alternatives to what it isyou're doingI mean I thinkI think in sports to have a newcomercome to in technology yes but in sportsis governed by rights so I think thatwhat you could see is people start tocarve off tools that can be used bypeople like Phil and I and then overtime they gain share and then eventuallythey get to a point where maybe they'reoffering something that we're not but Ithink as far as the content generationwhat we're doing is we're tellingstories based on Sports because we havethe rights to that right I do think thatthere are plenty of opportunities thoughfor startups to partner with us and tocreate something that we've neverthought of and to change the audiencewhat the audience gets at home rightthere are there's someone here who willcome up with something we don't do rightand we will go we need that or ouraudience decides they want that I thinkI don't know what it is but I thinkthat's what will happenokay well I was just open was sayingthere's no more powerful force in mediaand entertainment than fomo yeaheverybody has fomo right now becauseshe's been so hyped up which is a greatthing for a big company who's nowinstead of pushing change andtransformation we've got people pushingon us to enable them to use the tools soI think that bodes well for people beingcurious but I do think if you look atsome of the really amazing creators thatare using these tools today they are youknow a year or more ahead of anyonegenerally within our company in terms ofyou know sophistication of manipulatingmodels sure you know what they're doingwith prompting and queuing things up soI do think it's gonna you know it'sgonna have to be a combination of uslooking at those creators hopefullybringing them in or working with them onnew ideas and Productions but I don'tthink it's going to fundamentally shiftthe landscape of of the ecosystem itreally is another big technology Trendwe've seen many of them before is wedon't have people in rooms cutting filmanymore and that's right sure shift thedynamic of the industry so we'llthere'll be a disruption but I think itwill settle out I just hope there's youknow a larger volume of high qualitycontent that comes out of it because itshould be generally cheaper to produceand take some of the non-creative costsout of the creative output and if we canaccomplish that I think it's going to begood for creators yeah absolutely Iagree I I do want to highlight that Ithink one thing that's a commonality uhbetween what both of you said is itcomes down to when you say rights or yousaid the content depth like it'sintellectual property right and you guysboth have a very strong base there thething that I do think about a lot is newforms of entertainment yeah right thatemerge and generally may I potentiallyplays a role in making that happen andare you exploringumways of engaging audiences anddelivering compelling storytelling Philthat go outside of you know the videoplays when I press playwell this is this gets back to thedebatable point yes because everybodylogically goes to hyper personalizedcontent created on the Fly for anindividual based on their interestsrightI'm really skeptical of that sure havingjust seen the challenges of that sort ofyou know customized content outside ofreally great marketingum but I do think that there's a greatopportunity in content Discovery whereyou know we're still searching we'restill clicking and browsing on tiles ofthings yeah and that feels very archaicin a modern world so I don't know if youknow there's a new user navigationexperience it's much more intelligentthat you know it's kind of a companionyou know maybe clippy for those thatremember clippy clippy comes to lifefinally they're 30 years later I thinkwe're allowed to say clip you at aGoogle conference but yeah yeahit's a negative so yeah do you thinkthat content Discovery will get muchmore interesting because you know asDustin said you're not going in andmanually tagging things and organizingthem you know it will auto organize in adifferent way so I do think there's someopportunity there just just if I can addI think there's an interesting pointthough where we'll see anothergeneration of storytellers andtechnologists who grew up for lack of abetter term with the technologies thatwe're putting so they never dug aroundfor footage they've never looked attapes they started with something thatoffers it up to them oh they starteddigital right and I think that there'ssomething to be said out of that processand that learning what you you may getan evolution or you may get to a placewe haven't gotten yet and I think we'veseen that in some of the fast Servicesobviously we're very proud of of Plutoand what they've done Pioneer in thatspacebefore those Services came on nobodywould have really thought apseudo-linear experience where it feelslike an old channel guide but it'spersonalized reviewing like those arethings that are kind of emergent youknow businesses that are really superinteresting so I think you're right likewe have to learn from you know reels andTick Tock and others in terms of thatauto feed push type of experience andsee how it plays with longer formcontent nobody solved that one yet soit's an interesting one so with thatthank you both gentlemen I applaud thework you've done[Music]foreign"
