and access management this isgoing to be a power packed 45 minutesand I'm gonna give you a full Whirlwindtour of everything that Google cloud hasfor you in terms of identity and accessmanagementlet's quickly get started as folks arewalking in there are some seats here butplease do settle in really quick let'sstart off by talking about what we aregoing to cover over the next 45 minutesI'm going to start off by giving you asense of some of the trends that we arewatching as Google now these Trends arebased on what customers tell us whatanalysts tell us what's generallyhappening with the industry but I'mgoing to share a few that are ofparticular interest to Google I'm goingto talk about how that translates intothe full stack identity and accessmanagement that we have on Google Cloudwe're then going to start go deeper andtalk about identity policy policyintelligence and some emerging scenariosin the space of identity and accessmanagementI also have some demos towards the endand I promise to leave some time for Q abut if we run over my team and I we aresitting in the first row we are happy tomeet you outside the session over afavorite beverage and we can continuethe conversationwith that let's quickly get started withintroductions so what we're going to dois we're going to go around the room andwe're going to come up with two truthsand a lienotoo much pressure to come up with a lieall right so let's keep it simple let mequickly introduce you to myself my nameis Abhishek I'm a director of product atGoogle my team and I build the identityand access management capabilities onGoogle Cloudso let's start off by some key identityand access management trends that webelieve all of us should be payingattention tothis onenow customers routinely tell us that itis becoming very very difficult to thinkabout their Cloud deployments as secureby default now the good news is with theadvancements in infrastructures codepolicy s code generative AI it'sstarting to become very real to thinkabout self-securing and as I like tothink about them as self-healing Clouddeployments so the notion of secure bydefault in the cloud is an importantarea and you'll see us invest more inthat particular domainthe next one is around just the properidentity and access management spaceitself like a lot of people talk abouthow identity systems are Legacy accessmanagement capabilities are Legacy wellthe reality is in the cloud contextbuilding Cloud first identity and accessmanagement privilege access managementaccount takeover prevention fine grainAccess Control just-in-time access theseare in many ways emerging capabilitiesand vendors are starting to build moreand more cloud-first Cloud nativeTechnologies in this area now the way Ilike to think about them is these arenot just point solutions they need to bea set of woven tools that work acrossyour identity and access managementcapabilities both from uh admin timecapability point of view and a runtimecapability point of view so in one ofthe subsequent sections I'll go throughhow I like to think about the Spectrumor the Continuum of access managementcapabilities but the good news is thisis an emerging space so all of us is Iam practitioners it's a great space tobe inthe next one is around the just the purenotion of entitlements now there is datathat's available that across all of theclouds95 principles use less than threepercent of the permissions that theyhave been granted so all of us in thisroom are sitting with 97 entitlements onan average that we do not use now that'sa problem it's a problem because wecould all become accidental orintentional malicious insiders or or ouraccounts might get taken over and it maycause an identity breach so the notionof entitlement management is becomingsuper important from a I am point ofviewthe fourth one isone is a Eventing account takeovers bothfor human and machine identities andwhat that really means is investments inlogin fraud detection Step Upauthentication and other strategies thatcan both solve the user experienceduring the during the authenticatedsession but also prevent any kind ofaccount takeovers now this is aninteresting data from Microsoft thatover 78 of the Azure ad client base doesnot have MFA turned on so even though weare investing in more capabilities inthis area even basic things like MFAaren't turned on and if you think abouthow popularly Azure ID gets used I thinkthat's a huge problem so we need to getto broader MFA adoption and then finallyidentity is the ultimate threat surfacebut it can also be the ultimate controlsurface and that's the direction that wewant to move the industry towards sowith that let's quickly start talkingabout how does this start representingat Google cloud and what we think aboutas the full stack Cloud IM I'm going tostart off by talking about our missionas a company we are on a path to enableidentity first AI ml powered andpolicy-based security for your users foryour infra for your data and for yourapplications so the three things tofocus on are identity first AI mlpowered and policy based so thesubsequent portion of my conversationthis session is going to focus on thoseexact three areaswhat that really translates into is afull stack IM that can be representedthe way it's going to get built out onthe screen starting with the identityplatform so in terms of identity we havea broad spectrum of capabilitiesavailable for you in terms of cloudidentity Workforce identity Federationworkload identity Federation a veryrobust certificate management platformand also for your customer identitymanagement scenarios the gcip capabilityso from Workforce workload and cim youhave end-to-end capabilities availableas part of the Google identity platformnow if you go a step about that that'swhere access management starts cominginto the play and our view of accessmanagement is an end-to-end policy-basedaccess control system and notice I talkabout both admin time authorization andruntime authorization so capabilitieslike identity governance things that youdo when a new employee joins or on anoccasional basis for an audit that's anadmin time capability versus givingsomebody privileged access approvals atruntime that's a runtime authorizationcapability but notice the spectrum ofruntime authorization capabilities isnow starting to more prominently featurethings like fine grain access control oraccount takeover prevention or thingslike MPA and MFAand then finally if you have a robustidentity and access management stack youcan then start thinking aboutdifferentiated scenarios that IM lightsup for your applications and for yourdeployments scenarios like itdr identitythreat detection and response but alsofor your application the notion ofapplication security or fraud preventionall of these capabilities require IIM tobe robust and to work well with eachother so I see a lot of you have camerasin your in the air taking a photographthis is perhaps the most important slidein my conversation today so I'd urge youto take a photograph but this is whatwe're going to talk about over the nextfew sectionsso with that let's start going deeperall right all rightfantasticlet's start talking about identity sowhat I'm going to do is I'm going totalk about two aspects of identity I'mgoing to talk about human identities orWorkforce identity Federation and I'mgoing to talk about machine identitiesor workload identity and Federation andif I keep mixing up Workforce workload Iwant you all to be in mind Mill with meand exactly get what I mean but I'mgoing to try not to mess up those twothingsso when it comes to Workforceauthentication scenarios this is what wehear from customers as yourselfnow many customers who use gcp todayalready use cloud identity Cloudidentity offers the capability ofsynchronizing your existing identityprovider so your users and your groupsget synchronized over to Google cloudand then you can start managing yourGoogle cloud services now the feedbackthat customers have given us over theyears isthe first one you know customers haveextended Workforce or partners that theydo not want to onboard to their primaryidentity provider and occasionally theyhave a secondary IDP for them and theywant to just for those specific usersonboard that secondary identity providerwithout having to synchronize it withouthaving to go through all of thatinvestment so that's an extendedWorkforce scenario scenario that wetypically didn't have until now and thenthe second one is I'm a net new GoogleCloud user can I just start by nothaving to synchronize my IDP so I useOCTA or Azure ad and I just want to getstarted with Google not having to worryabout investing and synchronizing or anycompliance that comes with it so thosetwo scenarios now the good news is we'venow built an enabled workload identityFederation Workforce identity Federationwhich allows you to achieve exactly thatso you could be a pure play Google Cloudcustomer today that's using Cloudidentity which synchronizes your usersand your groups from your IDP over toGoogle in a sense making them Cloudidentitiesor you can use the workforce identityFederation feature in addition to Cloudidentity and what that allows you to dois onboard a secondary IDP withouthaving to synchronize it but the goodnews is you could start by choosing justto be a Workforce identity Federationcustomer meaning bring your ad bringyour octa no need to synchronizeanything no need to worry aboutcompliance or any additional Investmentsyou can get started with Google cloud ina matter of a few minutes so in one ofmy demos I'm going to actually show youhow this new capability of Workforceidentity Federation actually works in asense unlocking those two scenarios anew customer onboarding without havingto synchronize or existing customergetting to onboard an extended Workforcewith Google Cloudnow the workforce identity identityFederation feature is designed toleverage your existing identityInvestments you simply have youridentity provider where your users andyour groups and their claims are basedour tokenization service takes care ofall of the authentication and thepass-through in a sense enabling accessto Google Cloud apis the console and SDKseamless experience and we'll see thatin the demoso in terms of announcements at next areWorkforce identity Federation capabilitynow supports 76 Google cloud servicesincluding important services like GCEand that coverage is dramatically goingto expand over the next few months andby the end of the year you should havecomprehensive coverage across all of gcpservices and then just in terms of newfeatures a whole bunch of features onthe screen the one that I want toparticularly call out is that thesupport for authorization code flow whenyou're using openid connect in terms ofsetting up that Federationall right now let's move on and talkabout workload authentication scenariosnow just as Workforce authentication hasa few scenarios machine authenticationalso can have two prominent scenariosyou may have a scenario where you wantto authenticate your workloads to GoogleCloud apis so your workloads that arerunning on GCE on gke cloud runserverless or workloads that are runningon-prem or on AWS or Azure you may wantto authenticate them with Google Cloudapisor you may have a scenario when you wantto authenticate your workloads withother workloads so let's say you have aworkload running on gke and you want toauthenticate that workload with aworkload that's on-prem using spiffy allof these scenarios are already coveredby the Google Cloud workload identitycapabilities for workload authenticationso for example you could be on gke andto authenticate with Google Cloud apisyou could use gke workload identity oryou could be on AWS Azure or on-prem andyou can use workload identity Federationto authenticate with Google Cloud apisnow in terms of coverage for workloadauthentication scenarios from serviceaccounts to gke workload identity toworkload identity Federation and meshidentity we believe we have end-to-endcapabilities that are robust work for avariety of scenarios the customer wastelling me about a scenario where theyhave a hybrid deployment these are theoptions that would work for them todaybut we believe that Google has anopportunity to keep innovating in thisarea so what you're going to see us isbuild a unified identity across allenvironments which has strong life cyclemanagement security and industry-basednomenclature so we're going tostandardize on spiffy so over time whatyou're going to see is our entiremanaged workload identity platform andthe notion of a workload identity poolwill become unified across all types ofscenarios so if you're authenticatingwith Google cloud services for workloadsrunning on Google cloud or workloadsrunning on non-google cloud on-prem orin other clouds you'll be able to use aconsistent workload identity City Poolbacked by a certificate Authorityservice to carry out those scenarios nowthat's not a super Future Vision in factthis is happening now so by the end ofthis year you'll see a streamlinemultiple identity Types on Google Cloudwe'll start off by streamlining the gkeand Google Cloud workload identity poolssome announcements on the screenavailable in terms of the workloadauthentication area the one that I'dcall for you to pay attention to is theability for Now setting service countkey expiration this is an importantimportant feature it allows you to havebetter posture and better securityrelated to your workload authenticationwith service accountsall right so that's a you know highlevel view of everything that we'redoing in identity later today we have adedicated session on identity where myteam's gonna bring Goldman Sachs on thestage and take the theory into theactual practical on how a customerimplements some of these capabilitiesand I strongly encourage you to attendthat towards the end I'll have sessioncodes that will give you theunderstanding of what those sessions areso with identityout of the way let's talk aboutpolicy-based access control and as Imentioned we think about this as admintime and runtime capabilities for accessmanagement all using a unified policyplatform now when it comes topolicy-based controls we have threecategories of controls controls thathelp you with resource accesscontrols that help help you withresource configuration and controls thathelp you with resource boundary so theexample of a resource Access Controlwould be a resource-centric policy whichhelps determine what kind of permissiondoes a principal have against a resourceso an example of that would be doesAbhishek have the ability to create avirtual machine in a project that's aresource-centric policy or a resourceaccess control the second class ofcontrols is around resourceconfigurations this is organizationpolicies and customer organizationpolicies and what that really tellstalks about is what can kind ofconfigurations are allowed or denied sothat they can be enforced right when theresource is being created in a sensehelping you to get towards secure bydefault so for example can I create abucket with Public Access if I have anorganization policy that prohibits thata bucket with such access would never beable to get created so that's resourceconfiguration and then there's a thirdclass of emerging controls that we nowhave which ensure that you can set guardrails around which organizations canyour resources actually deal with nowthat's a very important control becauseit can help you in terms of dataexfiltration and Insider risk scenariosso you can set organization restrictionsto say my admin cannot even interactwith an organization that's not theorganization that I have configured forthem so those are controls that are setat the resource boundary in a sensebetween resource access resource configand resource boundary you get defense indepth across your deploy momentso let's start talking about GoogleCloud IM I'm going to talk about the sixprinciples that went into when we builtGoogle Cloud IM starting with the firstone which is centered around Simplicitywe have a universal notion of resourcehierarchy in Google which is cloudresource manager and a universalidentity and access managementexperience that works across all of thegcp services now that's importantbecause we can all agree identity andaccess management tends to be a complexarea but it's also an area that you needto really get through quicker so thatyou can start dealing with deployinginfrastructure and applications andmanaging your workloads in the cloud soSimplicity goes a long way to make iteasy for customers to adopt the GoogleCloud platform the second one is aroundmake identity easy so everything that Ispoke about in terms of Workforceidentity Federation the options that younow have use cloud Identity or bringyour own identity with Workforceidentity Federation don't have tosynchronize them or use a combination ofboth that makes identity easy so we areno longer mandating an approach thatshould be used you can decide whatapproach works best for you and get tothe more important aspects of your Clouddeploymentthe third one is the ability to rightsize roles now this is almost intuitivebut oftentimes not followed mapping jobfunctions to the correct roles so thatusers have exactly the permissions thatthey need to perform their jobs but thereality is all of us have 97entitlements that we don't use andthat's where access control nativelyfrom the platform is super important sowe have capabilities like I am rolerecommender which can periodically tellyou permissions that you never use butyou're still holding on to themthe next one is around the ability toset context to make an authenticationdecision context such as what's thesecurity status of my device what's theIP address that I'm coming from what'sthe date and the time what's thelocation these are important attributesthat can help make a strong decisionaround the reputation of the sessionitselfand then finally a comprehensive audittrail that allows you to have a deepunderstanding of when were permissionsgranted what privileges were escalatedyour ability to attest from a compliancepoint of view so these are the sixprinciples around which the Google Cloudidentity and access management platformwas built now I know I spoke about admintime and runtime so over the next twoslides I'm going to take you through avery very important admin timecapability this is the third time I'mgoing to say it in this session 95percent of us have 97 permissions thatwe do not use we need to start lockingthose down because that's an identitythreat service surface waiting to becompromised so at Google we have an AIml powered capability called IM rolerecommender that helps you do just thatand we had Ai and IM role recommendereven before it was cooler to say AI inevery sentence but the way I am rolerecommender works is let's say you havea set of permissions that have beengranted to youover a period of time you tend to useonly few of those permissions so maybeyou're using half of those in theory theadministrator should be able to go inand take away the rest of thepermissions now what customers tell usis yes that makes sense I should takeaway the permissions but I don't knowwhen the user may actually need thosepermissions and when they do need thepermissions it can cause a lot oftrouble it can hamper productivity sohow do you take away the permissionsthat the user will never need but stillleave behind permissions that they mayneed even if they have not used andthat's where the AIML aspect of the IMroad recommender comes in we are able tolook at your usage in the past 90 daysat a user level but then also look atdata at a broader organization level tomake predictions on permissions that mayget used even if they were not used overthe last 90 days what that allows you todo is right size permissions in the mosteffective manner in a sense enablingleast privilege with least effort soyour recommendations are based on 90days data we leverage Ai and ml to makethe right size recommendation we alsorecommend roles that are going to be thebest roles for the particular role to befine-tuned to and the best part youdon't need any configuration or anysetup to use the IM role recommender sotake away number one from this sessionis if you haven't looked at I am rolerecommender in Google Cloud I'dencourage you to check it out it's apretty cool feature it works by defaultand it can really tell you stuff thatyou don't need in there in terms ofpermission across your across your userbase so that's admin time authorizationenabled with entitlement Management onIM role recommendernow when it comes to runtimeauthorization capabilities this is aspectrum of capabilities nowunfortunately the way we've alltraditionally implemented thesecapabilities is that we tend toimplement them in silos and we need tostart moving away from that all of theidentity and access management systemsneed to talk to each other because whenan identity threat is in progress thatTelemetry that's unified across IM iswhat can help you protect your IMsystems and your Cloud deployments so interms of just-in-time and privilegedaccess you may wonder if Google cloudhas privileged access managementnatively we already do have capabilitiesthat can help you set up what kind ofroles need additional entitlements whatkind of users need additionalentitlements can there be a requestercan there be an approver over time whatyou'll see us do is build that even morenatively into the platform right nowit's available as a capability that yourun on cloud run in your targeteddeployment you'll see this become a morenative platform capability in the comingmonths or you can do something like atime-based condition in an IM policywhich allows you to enable break glassaccess for an administrator so let's saysomebody needs access at to troubleshoota production issue but if you use atime-based condition that access can berevoked within a few hours that way theuser is not sitting with permission thatthey don't need after the productionissue is overthe other aspect is around multi-factorauthentication so if you're a cloudidentity user you have variety ofmethods available for your second Factoryou can use backup codes you can use theauthenticator app you can use the Googleprompt and you can use security Keys aswe do at Google if you're on boardingyour third party identity provider usingthe workforce identity Federationfeature we will honor the MFA setting inthat identity provider as well so if youare one of those 22 Azure 80 users thatare using MFA we will honor the MFA butthe reality is that MFA adoption needsto get betterthe next one is around fine grain accessnow the way I think about fine grainaccess is you can think about access ata resource hierarchy getting finer socan somebody get access at an org levelat a folder level at a project level ata resource level you can do that with IMpolicy so I can go and get accessdirectly at a virtual machine or at aproject where that virtual machine isbased so that's fineness in terms ofresource hierarchy but there's also thenotion of fine grain access in terms ofdata so am I allowed to query data thatis already classified as pii so withcapabilities available in bigquery andspanner you can already do that today soboth in terms of resource and data youhave fine-grained access capabilitiesavailable and then the final one isaccount takeover prevention where you'llsee a lot more activity from uscurrently in Cloud identity you can goand configure the session length afterwhich a session is get it getsre-authenticated by the system itselfwhat we are now working on is for selectsend sensitive actions you'll be able toconfigure policies which force areauthentication on the principle solet's say somebody is trying to downloada service account key that's a sensitiveaction and if a user is trying to carryout that action even if they'reauthenticated and there were no otherrisk indicators because you have apolicy in place which says every timesomebody tries to download a serviceaccount key force them tore-authenticate so that there is nocookie theft or account takeover riskwe'll be able to honor that intent soacross runtime authorizationcapabilities I would strongly encourageyou to look at just in time privilegeaccess MFA fine grain access control andfinally the account takeover preventioncapabilities built into the gcp platformall right so that's policy let's quicklytalk about policy intelligence and thenwe'll talk about you know some of theemerging scenarios in this space nowwhen it comes to policies somebody wasasking me yesterday when they looked atthis diagram they were like Abhishekwhere does it start and where does itend the reality is it starts only on dayone when you create your policies forthe first time it never ends becausethat's how posture is you need toconstantly keep evolving and fine-tuningyour posture to make it more robust soyou can design your policies using ourrecommender capabilities but over timeas you deploy them you need to be surethat this deployment is not going tobreak something this is another feedbackthat we hear from customers that I knowI need to roll out this control but I'mafraid literally that usage I'm afraidto roll out the control because I don'tknow what's going to break so you havecapabilities like dry run and simulatoras part of policy intelligence that canlook at data over the last 90 days orlonger and can tell you if this changewere to roll out this is what you'relooking at in terms of breakage soeither account for it ahead of time orrevisit how you've defined the controland then more importantly you don't juststop there you're constantly analyzingdoing what-if analysis to figure out amI constantly meeting compliance am Itaking away permissions that peopledon't need and that's the analyzercapability so it's a Continuum of policyintelligence from recommender simulatorand analyzer and that's availablenatively in the IM platform and I'llshow you a demo of that so in terms ofpolicy and policy intelligence here theset of announcements that are ofInterest a new control which talks aboutorganization restrictions uh helps youto ensure that you can prevent dataexfiltration due to any kind of phishingor Insider attacks within yourorganization in a sense whatorganization boundary do you want to setfor your principles and then you can nowachieve greater control on yourorganization policies with customconstraints embedded into yourorganization policy and I'll show you ademo of that in terms of policyintelligence the ability to do customorder policy policy simulator and dryrun is now in public preview and thenshow off answer how many of you arealready using I am denyfew it's important that you start usingI am deny it's a very very importantcontrol now available in gcp but as youroll out I am deny you also need to beable to troubleshoot access issuesbecause of I am deny so policyintelligence capability fortroubleshooting access issues for imd9is now available in public previewall right one final section and thendemos and then q a so in terms ofemerging scenarios now one thing Imentioned in the beginning is thatidentity is the ultimate threat surfaceit is also the ultimate control surfaceso one area where directionally a lot ofinvestment is happening is identitythreat detection and response we'vealready started making thesecapabilities available in the securityCommand Center so if you use even threaddetection in security Command Center youcan get curated rules for identityrelated events so let's say you have adormant account getting used all of asudden or anybody trying to Grantanomalous access to somebody these kindof events using user analytics will getsurfaced in security Command Center youhave built-in custom detections and alsoplaybooks currently for Google Cloudidentity in SCC over time you'll see USexpand this for Workforce identityFederation and other scenarios in asense you can get findings in SCC whichbasically tell you you have problemsrelated to how your identities aregetting used now if you remember when wespoke about entitlement management wesaid that's an admin time activity rightif we are all taking care of thosepermissions ahead of time we wouldn'treally have an identity issue but thereality is no prevention is hundredpercent so you need a runtime catch andthat's what identity threat detectionand response does real time or near realtime can I surface a finding for youwhen it looks like something ismalicious with how your identities aregetting used and that's what thisfeature allows you to do so I wouldencourage you to check this out insecurity Command Center premium overtime this is going to enhance moreall right let's quickly look at somedemos so just like we did with thesession we started off by talking aboutidentity we spoke about policy andaccess control and then we spoke aboutpolicy intelligence we'll do the exactsame thing in these three next demoswe're going to start off by looking atWorkforce identity Federation and thenew method of onboarding azure ad orOCTA as a syncless identity provider inyour system so what you're seeing inthis demo is the new Workforce identityFederation capability this is going tostart rolling out to your systems in thenext few weeks I can start off bycreating a poolwhen I create a pool I need to provideit a name so I'm going to call my poolprimary Azure ad poolonce the pool gets created it says twominutes but that's the magic of demos Ican fast forward so in this case thepoll gets created fairly quickly I canthen start configuring my provider sowhat you're seeing in the screen is meconfiguring my Azure ad tenant to workin that tool so I provided provide theissuer URL the assertion claims thesecret I can then specify how do the howdoes the attribute schema map between mysource IDP and Google so in this caseI'm basically asserting how do thesubject and how do the groups translatewith each other I click continue andsubmit and what that's going to do iscreate my pool it's going to create myprovider I'll execute a few commands onthe Azure 80 side and from that point onI'll be able to use Azure ad in asyncless manner to access Google cloudservices it is actually as simple asthat so this is the new Workforceidentity Federation configuration UI andit's going to start rolling out to youto your deployments in the next fewweeks and it's going to show up under Iam right under workload identityFederation so that's how you onboardyour third party identity providerwithout having to synchronize itthe next demo that I have on the screenis let's say you have a resource Centricpolicy that takes care of certainbehavior that the resources shouldn'tfollow so for example in GCS GoogleCloud Storage you have a canned policyor an inbuilt policy which enforcesPublic Access prevention that means thatthese buckets cannot be publiclyaccessed and if this policy is enabledat a project level it applies to allbuckets in that project now you may havescenarios where you do want a fewbuckets to have public access and theonly way that you achieve that right nowis you actually move those buckets to adifferent project and you don't applythe policy on the other project andthat's how you achieve the separationbetween and that's not really you knowuseful it's actually pretty cumbersometo have to create a different projectjust to apply a policy a different wayso in this demo what you'll see is Ihave the canned enforced Public Accessprevention policy that's available inevery accountI can now add a custom constraint orcustom policy within the org policyitself what this one says is that if Ihave a resource tag as allow PublicAccess yes this could be whatever tagyou want to use in my case I said if Iever have a resource which says allowPublic Access yes override the policy sohere I have two buckets confidentialimages and public images currentlynotice tags are empty for both of themI try to load the public access and itwon'tso what I'm going to do is I'm going togo back to the buckets View and I'mgoing to add that tag to the publicaccess bucket and this is using the newsecure tax capability that's availablein Im so I'm going to specify allowPublic Access yes I click save it goesthrough in a few seconds the Dax shouldstart showing up on that screen let's goload that bucket again and hopefullythis time the image will loadthere you have it so this allows you toconfigure your organization policieswith custom constraints and moreimportantly use capabilities likeresource tags which are echoed in a veryrobust manner to really have thepositive that you need and not have tocreate multiple projects just to havedifferent policies apply against youragainst your bucket so this is alsoavailable now so this is customizingpolicies with resource tags and thenfinally we spoke about policyintelligence and the importance of I amdeny so I am deny if it's applicablewithin your organization or if aprincipal has an IM deny policyconfigured against them and if theydon't see the right access typicallythey're like usually confused why am Inot seeing this access so now you canuse the policy intelligencetroubleshooter to really figure out whya principle is not getting the accessthat they think that they should have soback in our GCS storage view you'll seemy create option for creating a newbucket is currently grayed out so I'mnot able to create a bucket if I I hoverover it it tells me that maybe you havean I am deny that's blocking you go talkto your administrator and have themfigure out why you don't have access sowith segregation of Duties in play youwould create a ticket for youradministrator previously youradministrator would look at a bunch ofpolicies and try to troubleshoot it nowwhat they can do is they can go run areport for your principle and for thepermission that you expect to see withina matter of a few seconds the reportcomes back and says your principal wasright in that they did have allowed forthem but we wrote a deny policy on topof it which explicitly said in this caseit says for me you're not allowed tocreate a bucket and that's why denytrumps allow and the access is not goingthrough but it's just the ability totroubleshoot that access issue you canimagine I am deny is an importantcontrol but when you roll out a controlalong with it comes Toil and more workfor people but if you have capabilitieslike these you can roll allow thecontrol in a risk-free manner but thenalso have ability to support yourprinciples when they run into accessissues and give them the rightinformation on what's really happeningthis capability is also now in publicpreview available in policy intelligenceright under IMall right with that I am through withthe planned content well within time wehave nine minutes for Q aum I before we get to q a I'm gonnaencourage you to take a screenshot ortake a photograph of this particularslide two sessions that I stronglyrecommend later today security 201 whichis about defining security Baseline somy team is going to walk you throughpolicy based Investments a targetedpolicy section from the session andthey'll have snap and box on stage withthem and then security 300 which isgoing to go deeper into the identityarea and the team's gonna have GoldmanSachs with them on stage so all of thestuff that I gave you the theory thecustomers are going to tell you how theyactually implement it and there might besome great learnings for all of us as acommunity[Music]foreign"
