the internet in the public Cloud soto kind of get us started I waspracticing this presentation with my 10year old daughter she lovesinfrastructure and uh she's like Dad yougot to start with a joke so I tried anumber of jokes they all failed and sothen I was like all right well this isGoogle I went to Bard set it in mypresentation and so here it is here's mybarred joke for youwhat's the differencebetween a sovereign cloud and the publicclouda sovereign Cloud wears a crownobviouslyyou're welcome you can you can take thatback tell that to anybody who you areso I'm very excited to be here we'regonna have a great panel coming up latertodaywe're going to talk all kinds aboutsovereignty and about what Google's beendoing to help address those air-gappedworkloads and environments and for thelast 10 years Google has been aninnovating and driving public cloud inenabling people to take advantage of alot of our infrastructure and servicesbut air gap workloads have not been ableto take advantage of thatand they've been left out and customershave been coming to us saying how canyou help us in these type ofenvironments and that's what we're hereto talk about todayso a little bit about myself my name isBrad Bonnett and I am the director ofproduct management for Googledistributed cloudand with us today we're going to have apanel of Industry Specialists fromaround the world that we're going tobring up to talk about a little bitabout how they've been using GDC andwhat they've seen in the marketbut before we get started with the panelI want to talk to you a little bit aboutGoogle distributed cloudwhat we've been building and what we'verecently announcedso firstwhy did we build Google distributedCloud which is we know that not allworkloads can move to the public cloudthis might be because you have aworkload that needs to run in a store orof a fulfillment centerand can't handle downtime for yourmission critical point of saleapplication or routing applicationor sometimes it might be you just arecreating so much datavia cameras and streaming analytics thatyou can't pipe that up to the cloud andso you need to process that locallytoday we're going to be spending more ofour timetalking about regulations and policythat really dictates that you need to berunning your applications in theseenvironments that are completelydisconnected from the public internet orair gappednow there's many examples that we see inpublic sectoralong these lineswhether that's building uh Financialdetection algorithmsand highly regulated environments incountries like France or Germanyor that's running National Defensesimulations in a country like Singaporewe know that the public cloud is not anoption for many of these workloadsand we also knowthat similar constraints exist forpublic companies as welland that might be workloads acrossbusinesses in financein healthcareor in many other manufacturing andregulated Industriesjust like these government agenciesdepartments and private sectorcompanies are looking for ways tomodernize their legacy I.Twhile meeting the strict data complianceand security requirements of theirparticular jurisdictionand this is where Google distributedCloud can helpso Google distributed cloud or GDC as welike to call itis purpose-built full stack solutionconsisting of hardware and software thatextends Google's infrastructureinto the edge and in your data centersit's built for AI and data workloadsmaking it easy to run things like vertexAI or manage database servicesit also has flexible deployment optionsin terms of different Hardware formfactorsand operational models that allow you tomeet the particular compliancerequirements you need it can be operatedby Google or it could be operated by oneof our tested partnersand lastlybecause of Google's open strategyand that's a core thing of what we doit's built with an open ecosystemenabling you to accelerate yourapplication development by leveragingbest-in-class servicesso we have a long history at Google ofbuilding AI into everything we do andthen bringing that to our customersso let's take a closer look at how youcan leverage Google distributed cloudin our Ai and data capabilitiesso first vertex AI on GDC offersworkbench and pre-trained models forspeech translation and optical characterrecognitionthis allows governments to do thingslike take handwrittenforms that are filled out by refugeesturn them using OCR intoreadable machine readable text and thentranslate them into the language thatthey needand soon you're going to be able to usethings like vertex pipelines andprediction to automate custom modeldevelopmentand document translation AI foron-demand translation of MicrosoftOffice documents and PDF documents withformatting retainedlastlywe have plans for Jeep new gpus and newsoftware to accelerate AI Innovation aswell as we're working through gen AImodel serving and fine-tuningso next on the database sidewe just announced that customers lookingto generate insights and unlock valuefrom their data can now take advantageof alloy DB Omni as a new manageddatabase offeringwe're really excited about alloy DB asit gives more than 2x faster thanstandard postgres SQLand develop delivers up to 100 x fasteranalytical queries than standardpostgreson top of alloy DB we're also enablingdataproc Sparkfor data and Analyticsand we know that this helps customers onon Google Cloud run spark at almost a 54lower TCOadditionally to make it even easier fordevelopers to build on air-gappedenvironments we're also expanding ourgdch Marketplaceto include mongodb Enterprise Advancedand elasticsearch so that customers withas easy as one click to can deploy thesoftware into their regulatedenvironmentsnext let's look at how we enable you theindependence and control you need withour flexible deployment optionsso we have a wide range of Hardware thatwe continue to add to with GDCspecifically today I'm going to talk alittle bit about the things that we'vebuilt and designed for these highlyregulated environmentsfirst we have new form factors thatwe're bringing to Marketruggedized tactical Edge devicesand modular data centers we also havenew hardware that we're bringing intoour customers that gives customers up to140 percentbetter performance for particularworkloadsas well as ddrm5ipc5 to analogue allow you to do morewith lessthese improvements enable fasterdecision making for customersas well as lowering their TCOif you haven't seen it yet you can godown and see the hardware verse and getto meet our equipment Hands-On andexperience some of our live demoson top of that open ecosystemor on top of that we also like I saidhave an open ecosystemand with this we're continuing to buildand add new partners and new isvs toenable youto better leverage their technology inwhatever environment you choosewe talked a little bit around elasticand mongodband this adds to our already robustecosystem of Partners and best-in-classHardware vendors that we continue topartner withlastly one thing that I'm very excitedabout that we recently announcedwe're bringing sapuh btp platform to gdchand this will be the only air gappedprivate Cloud infrastructure that willsupport their btp environmentso we've been doing a lot of work acrossour ecosystem enabling Partners enablingisvs and enabling different vendors sothat we can best support our customerswhere they need and how they need it tomeet whatever requirements that theyhaveso with that let's bring up our panelwe're going to have our panelistsdiscussionso I have a couple people with us todayfrom a variety of placeswe have Ryan McArthur I think Ryan youhave one of the long longest titles thatI've ever seen uh but I think you saidjust to say you're from JCC and jwcc anddisa yeah[Applause]you have quite the quite the fan clubyeahKristoff uh you're one of our firstpartner operators with the proximusgroup and I'm not even going to try tosay your last nameum and then last but not least we haveRoan Grover who works in the GDC sidehe's the director of product managementso Ryan I'm going to go to you firstsince you're closest so congratulationsyeahum I guess my first question to you iswhat are the benefits that organizationsthat you're working with they're reallylooking forby leveraging the cloud and the types oftools and environments that they seeum so I mean like from an AI perspectivelike what we're really looking at islike the chief data officer so one ofthe ones that they're looking at is dataCentric uh you'll see that they're doinga lot of pilot efforts to to use AI toreally get after enabling the departmentto streamline the capabilities that theyhave you also see organizations liketranscom the F-35 program trying to getafter efforts using AI to streamlinecost equipmentum just really trying to get after andunderstand what AI brings to the tableand then you'll also see organizationslike cyber command jfhq dodin some ofthe like the smaller organizations likeR cyberuh the Air Force cyber organizationswhat they can use from a securityperspectiveum to to Really harness the power of AIto to find threats and neutralize thembecause we have access to so much datathat we don't even know how to processit by just human means AI really allowsus to expand on that to the nth degreethat's wonderful I have to say Ryan youguys have the best names for things Ithink Rohan we should think about forGDC uh Kristoff what about you on onyour side with proximus and and all thethings that we've announced there do yousee places that you're trying toleverage kind of some of those advancesin AI for your constituents andcustomers yeah we see actually a lot ofgovernmental Ministries administrationshaving a lot of interest in AI Servicesreally a lot of interestand when we take a few use cases maybeas an illustration we have for examplecomputer visionto basically spot drug smuggling incontainers in the ports we see forexample tax returns analysis to identifypatterns to identify a fraudand even for tuned cars and motorcyclesI know you're into motorcycles there isa noise analysis to spot illegal tuningso um and that's actually really the thetension in which the public sector orthe government is because at least inEuropethey want to move from on-premise to thecloud because they want to benefit fromAI but on the other hand they are a bitscared to do so because of Regulationand compliance and I think gdchis really a solution that is spot on toresolve that tension yeah and Rohan haveyou seen this in we've heard a littlebit from from Ryan and from Kristoffhave you heard this from other customersas well yes we're seeing similarrequirements even outside of publicsector you mentioned a few of those uhthe semiconductor space manufacturing isconsidered National criticalinfrastructure and they have some of thesame compliance requirements you look atthe financial companies out there theyneed to secure their financial data andall of them have the requirement to tolead with AI workloads and they reallydon't have an option to do that todaywith their existing kind of Legacyon-prem capabilities and they don't havean option to go to public Cloud so Ithink what we are what we have built andwhat we're bringing to Market is reallya sweet spot to address all these needsyeah all right well let's pivot a littlebit uh from Ai and just look at some ofthe ways that you're leveraging kind ofcloud capabilities to provide you knowsecure services so Kristoff you talked alittle bit about that how do you thinkuh you're trying to leverage Cloudcapabilities to kind of levels theservices for your governments and yourconstituents well when we look atgovernments or regulated Enterprisesthey are considering multiple factorswhen identifying the right workload inthe right Cloud they are thinking aboutscale and cost of course aboutregulation compliance they're thinkingabout feature set they are thinkingabout avoiding lock-in vendor lock-in soit's multiple factors but the generalTrend we see is a need for sovereigntyin Europe and compliance on on the cloudand and why is that it's actually on onehand regulation gdpr shrimps 2 actuallystrictly regulating access to personaldatathere is a a general policy if I can sayit like that in Europe where there is awillingness to claim back solventtechnological sovereignty we see it inchip set with but also in the cloud andwe have also customers actually that areconcerned about where is my data who hasaccess to my data and you you forexample in France when when I wasdriving uh for the holidays there werewas a some some marketing around anapplication and they immediately saidand the data is hosted in France so justto illustrate you that there is thisthis this customer sentiment and um webelieve actually as I said before thatgdch is is spot on in in addressing thatand why it's because it brings basicallyThe Best of Both Worlds uh it bringsthat feature set from the public cloudor not all but a big part of it backinto on-premise and private privateCloud so we we call it the best of bothworlds uh and um we we have a uniquepartnership I believe with Google butalso with with Luke's connect who isowning the data centers and proximus whois operating it locally we have a uniqueproposition in the market and we haveactually quite a lot of customer demandsnow when we are doing uh the the roadshows for that for that offeringum just a follow-up to that it's greatwhere you kind of I don't know if therest of the the room understands exactlyhow that partnership Works what do youthink is is so important to thecustomers that you're speaking to aroundhaving Lux connect and having proximusin there to partner together well whatis important for them is on one hand itis operated locally by proximus proximusis the incumbent Telecom operator inBelgium and Luxembourg so it's a namethey know they trust it's a trustedNetwork provided provider on the otherhand the data is located in the datacenters of looks connect to hisgovernment owned so there is this localtouchon the other hand there is also Googlewho brings the Innovation the featureset and finally it is air gapped so thatI think that is also the the veryimportant uh element in in the mix isthatthere is no connection with Google orthe internet so basically if there arefeature sets we screen them and thenupload them in in the in the platformbut there is no direct connection to uhto Google and that is very importantyeah now Ryan I think yours is going tobe a little bit different to this youranswer to this one but same thing to youwhat are some of the cloud capabilitiesthat you're looking to to provide kindof secure services for government uhprograms well I mean so so jwcc being acontract vehicle you know the the intentfor the the Department of Defenseobviously from it's not citizens it'sit's for the Warfighter so our Focus forthe all the csps was to deliverclassified Cloudum for the entire departmentum the defense agencies the militarydepartments the fourth estateum the intent that Google had to deliveron was an air gapped cloud and not justan air gap Cloud that you know was aspecific need you had to deliver asolution set that met what you're livingin the commercial space and then bringit into the classified space what you'vedone with gdch is uniqueum and we've talked about this yesterdayin our discussionsum you know you guys have gone after itfrom a tactical perspective gone afterit from a classified perspective you'vematched it both in in secret and NTSbut what we're what we're reallyinterested in what you're going to beable to do with it is from the softwareperspective you're not you don't reallyit doesn't really matter what your yourpartner is it's really what you're doingfrom the software perspective and whatyou're deliveringum and then being able to take that andput it on the smallest form factor orthe largest form factor be able to scaleit across but the secure services thatwe're really looking for is it justcomes back down to how your meeting ourrequirements and how you're meeting theregulations that we've been put in placethat it doesn't just come after from usbut it also comes out with our partnersin the ICum that really is at the end of the dayis what fits the bill no I think that'sgreat andum Rohan you talked a little bit aboutdifferent form factors and how we'remaking it consistentumthat's another one I think is differentthan the proximus angle but are youhearing that from other uh customers inother places in the world yeah and Ithink it's an important point right ourengineering team some of whom aresitting here have done a fabulous job ofmaking sure that the software stack isconsistent whether it's a data centerClass Type product or a modular datacenter or a tactical Edge product rightthe services at these differentdeployments may not be exactly the samebecause you may not require a databaseat a tactical Edge but we've made itconsistent across the board so atwhatever classification level thatyou're at you can kind of support thosetype of capabilities and I'll say onemore comment on this right so Googlecalls itself the workload optimizedcloud and I think on a distributed Cloudside we've tried to do the same wetalked a lot about kind of AI workloadswhich are critical but they're also kindof modern workloads that use kubernetesand we have the Google kubernetes enginenow part of GDC right that's a great wayfor develop developers to take advantageof modern application developmentpractices we you just announced alloy DBavailable on Google distributed cloudand then lastly but certainly not leasta lot of public sector organizations arestill working with Legacy Enterpriseworkloads right and we have to be ableto cater to those I would venture that avast majority of workloads in publicsector are still VM based today right sowe haven't like we're spending a lot oftime making sure that our capabilitieson Virtual machines as well as Legacyworkloads are also available sap btp isa clear example of how we are innovatingnot just on AI and kubernetes but we'realso bringing these traditionalEnterprise applications on Googledistributed Cloud which will allow us todrive adoption in public sector that'sgreat and actually Kristoff is thatsomething you also hear from yourcustomers is that combination of Legacyworkloads as well as new forward-facingworkloads absolutely but I think the thethe common denominator is really thesensitivity of the data I think that'suh is it data which is related to uh toSocial Security about uh basically theidentity of the customers it's reallymore that type of data independent ofwhat type of application it is that isthe driving the need for gdch wonderfulumand actually Ron I'm going to ask youone more question before I get back tothese two gentlemen so you talked alittle bit about the different formfactors and some of the things we'redoing on Legacy is there other thingsthat you guys you and the team are doinguh to provide secure servicesand make it easier for customers toadopt these capabilities yeah I thinkI'll just follow up on what Kristoffsaid right when we build this platformwe started off with the premise that itis absolutely air-gapped right we didn'ttake existing infrastructure and try toretrofit it to a operator Gap right orfirst operating principles were that itwill never ever connect to the Internetor the public cloud and and since it wasnot an afterthought like everything thatwe do on the platform is based on thosezero trust security principles and thatbasically means that when we go throughsome compliance Acquisitions and ofcourse the U.S government has verystrict accreditation requirements as asRyan knows very well and I forget howmany pages of uh acquisition documentarysubmitted for the program uh but webuilt it from day one like it wasn't anafterthought a lot of products thinkabout compliance and acquisition afterGA right we knew we could not make thisgenerally available until we had metthose compliance requirements not justfor the US government but for you knowour the European governments that havetheir own set of requirements andcandidly everybody has differentclassification levels and we have builtthis for the highest possible levelacross the boardyeahum actually Brian I'm going to put youon the spot on this onebecause I think uh Rohan brings upcompliance right and I know both of youhave been talking about your operate inhighly regulated environmentsum how are you how do you ensure theworkloads that you're working with arearemeeting those kind of requirements andare within that compliance envelope wellI said you know first it's important tounderstand that we start with a baselineright so the Baseline starts with thepartnership that we have with Googlewhich is or any CSP and and that startswith the provisional authorizationprocess which is what we call on the dodon the IC it's called the ATO processbut that's the Baseline that any cloudservice provider goes through and at alevel so for gdch that's going to be theimpact level six for classified forsecret and you have TS and that's thethe pages and pages of testing and Pentesting that you have to go through toactually get your foot in the door toactually put something on the tableum that that's that starts with apartnership between us the governmentand in the CSP that really starts thewhole process for for us once once we'vedone that we've put the environment inplace then it really starts to go to thethe ATO process that we call the ATO andthe dod which allows for a workload toget done by a mission partner so if theArmy wanted to do something specificallyso we're talking about like the F-35program if they're working on somethingspecifically for themselves if they'reworking on trying to get after that AIinitiative that they want to build outthey would go frame it they'd take it totheir risk Authority and then that thatATO would get approved based off of aset of risks but again it goes back tothe original Baseline that we've we'vealready garnered so that's why that thathuge testing process that Google or anyother CSP has to go through up front alot of that work is so arduousApprentice so that we can move morequickly down the road so that heavyregulation in the beginning is so thatthe government can move more quickly inthe classified in on the cloud and theunclassified space later on down theroad yeah and I will say from theteeny's perspective I think it's been awonderful Journey with us working withwith jwcc we've learned a lot and Ithink the product is is much better forit so it's been a great partnership theentire time and we really appreciatethat now Kristoff I'm going to go to youbecause yours is different but how doyou uh kind of ensure that you'recompliant with your regulations I justwant toumthere is one extra angle to this it'snot only about regulation it's alsoaboutpublic perception so customers arereally concerned on where their data isso it's not only regulation it's publicperception it's also survivability andother key I think that's also veryimportant we we had in Europe a branchof a big financial institution that wascut off of the cloud because ofsanctions Etc and actually a lot ofDutch customers could not dotransactions Financial transactions sothere's also a notion of survivabilityand other key and then what we have alot of customers that have that go evenBeyond regulation it's about classifiedand which really have a very rigorousprocesses and process needs so I justwant to add that it's not only aboutregulation but multiple multiple factorsI think how we ensure compliance withregulation it is about and we are veryintensively working together on that isabout clarifying A really the operatingmodeland that is like what are theresponsibilities of each site at theGoogle site and us from our side as alocal operator and making sure thatthere is indeed showing anddemonstrating that in that operatingmodel there is absolutely no connectionto the internet or the public cloud is akey factor I think what helps also isthe physical segregation betweencustomers on the platform there islogical segregation within a customerbut physical between the the customersand then the local operationsso it's really done locally through alocal providerum actually that's a great segue forRohan I I think it'd be good to talk alittle bit more about what we mean bypartner operated uh so can you explainto the the group what we mean when wesay partner operated yeah absolutely soGDC hosted was built from day one to bea fully air gapped managed private Cloudsolution and that means that we're notjust sending hardware and software uh toa customer site and asking them tooperate it uh we have two models ofoperations in one model we are buildingout a very capable operations team theseare googlers that will manage deploymentfor example with the US government rightlet's say Google managed offering and wewill do this for uh certain countriesthe us being one of them and maybe a fewothers within Europe we understandsovereignty is a is a key principle andEurope wants to have local trustedoperating Partners like proximus theywant to know that the operations teamare EU citizens and at their data andtheir operating model are kind of securewithin the country within the datacenters like Lux connect is thegovernment owned entity and our gdchproduct will be in those data centersoperated by a trusted local entity likeproximus I think outside of the USwe're going to see this partner operatedmodel beingvery pervasive it makes sense this isthe principle of sovereignty and at theend of the day I think it comes down totrust that Google is a relatively newentrant in this space right some of ourcompetitors have been here longer but wetruly believe that we've built a productthat starts from first principles and wehave to earn the trust we have to ownthe trust of the US government we haveto own the trust of Europe in generaland across the world I think we're doingour best to get there yeah and I want togo back to this a little bit this isthis is great so Kristoff the firstdeployment that we have is in Luxembourgis that just for Luxembourg uhcorporations and customers or do you seethat as being something for for morewell we are ambitious huh so uh so wewould like uh really to to claimsovereignty at the center of Europe sowe want to really expand it uh to uh toBelgium to potentially the Netherlandsand you you can ask yourselfum why not uh attract workloads acrossEurope in the center of of Europe so uhuh in Luxembourg so uh we we are we areAmbitions we want to to move Beyond andbecause you could do a parallel with uhfinancial institutions you have a lot offinancial institutions that are locateduh within Luxembourg because there is avery strict regulation we could have thesame with the workloads yeahum speaking of that Ron uhwhat are some of the things so we talkeda little bit about compliance actually alot about compliance we've talked a lotabout kind of some of the reasons whyum what are some things that we do ontop of that from an engineeringperspective around enabling complianceas kind of a piece of the product itselfyes I'm glad you asked so as I saidsecurity is built by Design in theproduct let's start off withmulti-tenancy right so we expect that aGDC Zone will consist of multiple racksand will be shared by multipleorganizations now we have to ensure thatthere is absolutely no data leakagebetween one organization and the otherand we've created our kind of tenantboundary at a server level right we knowthat you know in the recent past therehave been you know cyber security issueswhen you share a server and try tosegregate workloads betweenorganizations within the same server wedecided we would not do that like wewould allocate a server or more one ormore servers to a particularorganization Asian or a tenant andensure that there is absolutely nochance of data ever Crossing thoseboundaries and I think that's going tobe critical for like proximas when theybuild out a GDC Zone and onboardmultiple customers on the platform theyhave to be sure that one customer's datais segregated within that set of serversor compute racks and on the USgovernment side I don't know how muchthe agencies share with each other butif they do choose to share then youcould have some some multi-tenantrequirements there as well we shareum it's a interesting story we met anumber of different agencies uhyesterday with with Ryan and apparentlyit's not very common to have all ofthose agencies in the same room at thesame time so it was nice to meet all ofthem at the same timeum but in addition to multi-tenancy andkind of making sure the segregation isat the server level like every part ofour process is secure we follow oursecure supply chain so the point oforigin of the hardware right if it isdestined to the US government it has tooriginate in the US and we must trackeach of those individual components fromthe point of origin to where it'sdelivered uh similarly in Europe rightwhen we go send Hardware to Europe itmust be in a facility that is located inthe EU the secure software supply chainas well like everything must be signedand you know the customers must beconvinced that there is no way foranybody to Tamper along the way and soall of this was built again from day oneright we knew that we would have toadhere to the strictest kind of securityregulations and these are just a coupleof examples in which we're making surethat we do that yeahum you brought up some interestingthings there and I want to go back toyou Ryanwe've talked about kind of some of theflexibility and the configurations ofGDC and specifically you can get assmall as I think Rohan you said fourracks three racks actually no yeah uh soyou can get this down as small as threeracks but it can grow to hundredswhat is for the jwcc and the differentdepartments are you looking just for onegiant kind of uh deployment or does thatlead to things that like you think itcan be helpful for your customers well Ithink it just really depends on on theuse case right and and that's the thespace that the Department's trying to towork through today so obviously today wehave the requirements that are laid outin the contract from the classifiedspace which is you know our data centerrequirement of three uh three datacenters both in in the secret NTS spaceoutside of that when you go to theTactical Edge it really comes down tothe the specific Mission partner and itreally really is specific to how theArmy may want to operate or how a co-commay want to operateum and it also depends on when what'sgoing onum if you go back as far as when we werein Afghanistan like that's a completelydifferent setup if you go to where wewhat's going on in Ukraine completelydifferent setup so it really depends onon the aor that you're in Indo paycomthat aor is is is a completely differentsetup gdch I think uh has a lot ofdifferent applicabilities across theboard with what the Department's tryingto douh so a lot of the other csps have hasoptions as well but I think gdch is aninteresting uh is an interestingopportunity for the Department uh longterm yeahum that's great Kristoff I'm going to goto youso we talked a little bit about the sizeand shapes but you talked a little a lotabout how we were operating and Rohantalked about some of thoseconfigurationsfrom your perspective right because youmanage multiple uh different companycountries in your role does each countryin Europe have the same configurationthat they're going to need are theygoing to have different compliancerequirementsum that you're going to have to kind ofsnap to yeah I think there is a tendencyor a willingness in Europe to harmonizea bit the the requirements uh howeverwhat uh what we see from some of thediscussions uh that we're having with uhthe the customers in in differentcountries is that some customers arevery open to have their dataactuallylocated in Luxembourg even if they arein another countryhowever some customers really want thatthat the data resides in the countryso I would imagine that there will bemultiple platformsacross multiple countries but we werequite surprised that actually customerswere open to have actually their data inanother country but in Europewonderful well thank you all very muchhave a great rest of next and uh we'llhope to see you in the future[Music]"
