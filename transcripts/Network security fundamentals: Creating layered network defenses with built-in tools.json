    "transcript": "foreign[Music]we're going to cover the fundamentals ofnetwork security using Google's built-inprotection tools today you're going tohear from Susan Wu who's a greatoutbound product manager that I get towork with on our network securityproducts my name is Peter Bloom I run agreat team of product managers some ofwho are here in the audience and theycover the products that we're going totalk about today and then we're superlucky to have Dennis from our customerWix he came all the way out from Israel15-hour flight to join us and he's goingto talk about how Wix uses some of ourTechnologies to protect their websiteso I'm going to start by giving anoverview of an example application I'mgoing to use a complex multi-cloudapplication and we'll use thatthroughout the session to talk about thedifferent layers of defense that you canuse to protect applicationsI'm going to break this into two majorscenarios the first is around protectingservices like a website or API that isexposed to the public internet so we'lltalk about the layers of protection thatyou get against the raw elements of theinternet uh Dennis is then going to comeup and talk about how Wix uses some ofour products to protect them from DDOSattacks and their massive cloud serviceand then Susan's going to come up andtalk about the products that you can useto protect your applicationinfrastructure things like the VMScontainers serverless and even serviceslike bigquery and Google storage and atthe end we'll leave some time for Q athere's a microphone over here and soyou can make a line there we're alsohappy to stick around in the hallway toanswer any questions you have andthere's a bunch of the PMS for theindividual products here as wellso let's get started so this is I'mgoing to paint the picture of a complexmulti-cloud application I'm going to usea complex application but everythingthat we're talking about scales down toeven a single monolithic application ina single Cloud pointing to internalusers but I wanted to use a complex casebecause it helps show you all thedifferent layers of protection that youcan deployso it all starts with users coming infrom the public internet and servicestrying to access your apis they connectto something called a global front endthat's responsible for deliveringscaling and protecting your applicationsthen there's a primary Cloud assemblypoint we generally find that someonepicks the cloud that's going to be wheremost of the services are and so I'll usethat of course in Google Cloud for thisexampleincreasingly people are running this incontainers and even serverless and inturn those services are connecting todifferent public cloud services sothings like vertex AI bigquery evenGoogle cloud storage and so we'll talkabout things that you can use to protecteach one of those layersand now it's very common that some ofthe services are running in other cloudsso that's the multi-cloud aspect so forexample a product database and then wesee a lot of people incorporating SASServices into their applications as welland so a good example of this is SMSServices right if you're going to sendpeople text messages you can hook intosomething like twiliosoapplications are getting big and complexand one of the big things that weannounced at the show in the keynotethis morning you saw TK and we're goingto talk about it more is somethingcalled the cross Cloud Network and thisallows you to really simplify thedelivery scaling and protection ofcross-cloud applications and so we'regoing to focus on the protection aspectsin this section session but tomorrow wehave a drill down session just on thecross Cloud Network it's the arc 202session I'd invite you to come to thatwe've got a lot of connectivity optionsas well that we'll talk about thereokay so let's talkit's toxic scenarios so I'm going tothrough the services that you'd use toprotect an internet facing service so anAPI or website that's facing the publicinternetand that can be for you know using ourGlobal front end for services that arein our Cloud but it can also beapplications that are in other clouds oreven on-prem or in colos and thenSusan's going to come up and talk aboutthe application or the products that youuse to protect services that are in ourcloud or across other clouds so she'llcome up after Dennis so the cross CloudNetwork covers both scenarios withml-powered protection the highest threatefficacy of any public cloud and we'llhave a drill down session right afterthis it's actually talking about somenew announcements around thatand then lower total cost of ownershipversus doing a per Cloud solution sothis session as I said is going to coverprotection but if you want to hear aboutthe whole cross-cloud network story youcan come tomorrow to the arc 202 sessionor we have a keynote for networking inthe morning as wellso let's get into talking aboutprotecting Global application front endsso serving applications and contentsfrom different clouds in the past hasrequired customers to build a complexmulti-vendor front end and you end uphaving different security controlsdifferent ways of using the productdifferent features in each one thecrosscloud network provides a simplifiedand unified solution so it's built on ontop of our Cloud Network that'savailable in 200 countries around theworld it's backed by our own massiveprivate backbone and this is actuallysomething we built originally to powerYouTube map search and it Powers thenetwork for Google Cloudso it has vast connectivity we have ourown private backbone we have underseacables the amount of capacity on thisthing boggles the minduh and then we have privateinterconnection points so there's 187places around the globe where you canactually interconnect your networks yourColo into our Network and you can getsuper fast reliable performance and thenwe have dedicated Connections in otherclouds like AWS and Azure and then onthe public side we have massive peeringwith isps so with over a thousand ispsaround the world so everybody wants tooffload their YouTube traffic and so wehave massive interconnectivity with allthe last mile networks whether it'sgoing to consumers or officesand so this lets us provide a singleglobal global front-end service that cansit in front of apps and art cloud orother clouds and have great performanceand connectivity so now what I'd like todo is start talking through the layersof protection I'll start at a high leveland then we'll keep drilling downso first is cloud DNS this provides GoGlobal public and private DNSresolutions we have super fastperformance and high scales that letsyou soak up things like dns-based DDOSattacksnext up is cloud armor which providesDDOS protection and a web applicationfirewall so this thing has blocked someof the biggest attacks on the internetso we've got a great blog that Emil overhere wrote that talks about I think itwas 46 million requests per second allHBS traffic and we were able to blockthat with Cloud armor and this coversboth Network and application basedattacksnext is recaptcha Enterprise which helpsprotect against fraudulent activity andabuse all without creating friction forthe users it's provided globally forapps all these things are providedglobally for apps that are running inour Cloud other clouds or even on-premand Colo now let's dig into each one ofthese in a little more detail so CloudDNS is our Global managed DNS servicethat provides name resolution and DNSserving it's deployed globally and weuse anycast networking which allows usto localize the requests from the usersso it means they get fast performanceand high reliability and with massivescalability it can instantly handlelegitimate spikes to your applicationlike a flash sale or a bunch of peoplecoming in for a new release butimportantly it can soak up massivedns-based DDOS attacks as well and youget a single solution across both DNSServices as well as private DNS withinyour cloudsome of the recent Innovations in CloudDNS we've made some DNS securityimprovements to protect against zonesbeing poisoned in Downstream resolversusing DNS cookies and then Cloud DNS isNow the default DNS service for gke whenyou're using our managed kubernetes orkubernetes service then you can actuallyit's just going to have Cloud DNS bydefault and you can manage DNS throughkubernetes apis and configuration andthen we recently introduced amulti-provider DNS solution that letsyou synchronize DNS records acrossmultiple providers so you havereliability by using multiple DNSproviders and so it allows you tosimplify operations but really improvereliabilitynext step is cloud armor which providesDDOS Protection Plus a web applicationfirewall to protect your internet facingservices from both known and unknownattacks so it has built-in rules forcommon attacks things like SQL injectioncross-site scripting log4j which youknow we all remember from a couple yearsago and then it has an AI IML so youknow AI is Big at the show we've had ourAIML system for a couple years now it'llmodel your traffic in an hour to learntraffic to your service and then it'llstart detecting unknown attacks and itused to be that you had to go throughand and say okay and deploy a rule I'lltalk in a second about a new auto deploysystem in addition to being able toprotect web protocols websites web appsapis for mobile applications Cloud armorcan also protect custom protocols sothings like anything with TCP or UDPprotocol gaming Services VoIP Serviceswe even have some customers thatterminate their own https they can runthat through Cloud armor and we canprotect it in addition to providing theservice we also haveresponse services so when you're underattack you can pick up the phone or youcan email us and we'll help you during aDDOS attack and will also provide DDOSfeed protection so if you incur a lot ofnetworking charges during a big DDOSattack will actually give you a creditbacksome of the most recent Innovationsaround Clark armor are custom rulecreation for TCP and udb basedapplications so this is for gaming andVOIP we actually allow you to bitematching on your own custom protocols soit allows you to let just your protocolthrough and block the attacks and thenCloud armor has been a global Servicefor a number of years ever since wereleased it but we introduced at theshow a new Regional version of cloudarmor that's integrated into ourregional web load balancer and thatallows you to keep configurations andTelemetry within a certain area to meetsovereignty and compliance requirementsand also to allow for very high-endreliability scenariosand then the last thing is auto deployso I talked about adaptive protectionour AIML system it used to be that you'dlook and see the the alert and you'd sayyep please go block it and now we have asystem where you can basically have usas soon as we detect an issue willautomatically deploy the mitigation andblock the the traffic for youNext Stepapplication toolkit that we we'vereleased at the show that allows you toprotect and deliver your internetapplications more easily our with ourGlobal front end so This integratesCloud armor Cloud load balancer andCloud CDN with popular CI CD platformsso things like Jenkins gitlab and ourown cloud build system and it's anopinionated approach with best practicesbuilt in based on our experiencedeploying it with thousands of customersand it's a toolkit so you can use thewhole thing or you can just taketerraform pieces you can take the pieceswe use to integrate with Jenkins orgitlaband it includes recommended settingsacross the products for delivering andprotecting your web applications it haspre-created workflows so you can youknow within a couple minutes you canspin up a whole Global front-end stackyou can spin up one in development onein staging one in production it lets youmove settings it lets you do rollbackacross those applications and then wespend a lot of time on simplifiedworkloads for things like Canarydeployment so if you have a new versionof your service you can deploy it outinto production and you can give it justa little bit of traffic test thateverything's going okay ramp up or youcan roll back if there's a problemand so you can find a link to our GitHubwith all the code and Snippets that youcan get therethe next thing is recaptcha Enterpriseso this helps protect Global front endsfrom Fraud and Abuse it combines aglobal cloud service with code on theendpoint to help detect and stop Fraudand Abuse it has an Adaptive riskscoring system so if you think someone'sa little sketchy you can send them asecond Factor authentication if you knowit's fraud or you know it's Automationin use you can just outright block themor redirect them to alternate contentand despite the name it's frictionlessso nobody has to solve puzzles itactually has code that runs either in amobile app or in the browser to collecta bunch of signals in Telemetry andfigure out if it's fraudulent activityor a real human and recapture Enterpriseis integrated with Cloud armor so itmakes it simple deploy and take actionsthings like blocking or redirecting toalternate content we have some customersthat block scraping attacks they sendthem off with fake content fake you knowimages and prices and things like thatso some of the recent Innovations inrecapture Enterprise have been a mobileSDK so you can actually integrate theclient-side system to pull signals intoAndroid and iOS applications and ithelps protect against a wider set ofon-device fraud this complements theJavaScript code that runs in the browserfor recapture Enterprise accountDefender which helps protect against awider range of account takeover attacksplus it gives you the ability to triggerthat multi-factor authentication if youthink if you're getting a higher riskscore back and now we can help protectagainst financial and credit fraud withdetections for things like passwordleaks you can actually tell a user heyyour password's been leakedfraudulent credit cards and even SMSfraud protection so those are theproducts that help you protect yourGlobal Internet front end and with thatI'd like to hand it over to Dennis fromWix to come talk about how they're usingsome of our products to protect theirbig service here you go Dennisthank youhiShalom to everybody my name is Dennisshartov I'm in charge of the Adidasprotection Solutions in the vixnetworking grouppart of theproduction infrastructure Departmentweeks is is an Israeli company thatprovides a cloud-based web developmentand hosting servicesreal mobile users to create websitesplease online drag and drop tools evenwithout deep knowledgein Vietnammixed audiences is several bigcategorieseach of them represented by manydifferent types of sizerestaurants and loggers agencies and uhEnterprise customers and moreweeks is one of the largestCrossing services in the worldwe have more than 200 millions ofregistered usersand the corresponding numbers of sizeI want to highlight the skill of thesolutionso let's talk about protectioneach site can be attacked and our clientsites alsosince we support millions of sites ourinfrastructureis constantly under attackmost often our our clients sites areunder attackbut there are also attack on ourinfrastructure websites are rendered andstoredlet's imagine the site your siteto createprotection rules for the site you needto know a traffic profile of the siteminimum and maximum load volumes andrates some base Lanesgeography of visitors and a lot ofdifferent a lot of different thingsyou can create profilesyou can create protection rulescorresponding to well-known profiles ofthe siteit's not so trivial but not a rocketscienceand now imagine you have millions ofdifferent sites with different profilesof traffic for each of themat weeks we need to protect millions ofsites these different loads withdifferent geography of visitorsall differencebut each side or group of sites shouldbe protected differentlyit's not an easy task in itself anddidos attacks are growing last time thisis a challengehow to protect millions of differentsites with high efficiency and withoutfalse positiveswe tested several existing Solutions butgot unsatisfactory resultsand we decided to develop our ownsolution for detecting and mitigatingthose attacksAdidas production itselfit's a two big different thingsfirst of all we need to detect maliciousrequestsrecognize attackand generate actions or protectionpolicies second part we need to applythe policy to inbound trafficas close as possible to source of theattackand so far I suppose as far as possiblefrom our infrastructurewe have built an effective solutionfor detecting and mitigating the doseattacks to our infrastructure and ourclient sites but we wanted to improveour DDOSdetector worked fine but we have aseveral we had several questions withfilteringbefore Cloud armor we had severallocations these in-house dedosprotectionoperating in different layers andenvironmentswe have some questions withthis filtering as I mentionedhard tomanage and make a changes because wedidn't have a single endpoint formanagement we use the different systemsfor example for layer 3 4 and layer 7filtering located in different placesand different layersuhlimited capacity problem for example ifwe havea production bandwidth of one megabitper second then to protect againstvolumetric attacks we need to havecapacity 10 times largerand the same situation we have with theweb application firewall we need onlyone for production but we should have10. and pay for 10. and we can't easilyand simply increase our capacitysometimes it takes advancesand we can only assume the size ofattack in the futureit is also a problem of gross planningin terms of estimating capacity andcostswe started to use cloud armor protectionwhy Cloud armorwe have several advantages here first ofall this is a centralized management wehave a single endpointfor layer 3 4 and layer 7 filteringmanagement managementthese flexible and Powerful rulesbecause we have a single point formanagementwe can easily integrate it with ourexisting those detection systemalso ability to grow and absorb biggerthose attacksum Cloud armor has unlimited ISP andfirewall capacity from our perspectivewe don't need to think aboutin increased capacity about the capacityplanningwe will think about itGoogle has a good SLA with many pointsof presencewe can connect to the Google Network inHDC or even use public internet forconnectivitylatencylast but not leastit's a partnership we already hadsuccessful cooperation in the past withthe Google teams in other projectsasI mentioned we have built an effectivesolution fordetecting those attacksand we can easily use it to manage Cloudarmor protectionas a flexibleunlimited and Powerful firewall on theedge of our Networkas close as possible to the source ofthe DDOS attackson the diagram you can seeDynamic mitigation process of the DDOSdos detectoranalyze access logs detect maliciousrequestsrecognize attacks and generate theactions those Enforcerperforms actionsto Cloud armor this Google API andattack is mitigated by Cloud armorprotectionthis process works constantly andconstantly adjusts the protection rulesaccording to the detected attackin theater of the attack will be changeda new attack will be created it will bealso mitigating during the nextiteration of the processthis approachallows us to build powerful resilientand flexible DDOS protection Solutionsthis is an example example probablylargest attacklast yearon the top picture you see the graph ofthe blocked requests by Cloud armor siteon the bottom a graph of the requestpass it to our back end after thefiltering at the same time framethere are no any deviation on the bottomgraph becauseDDOS was blocked on the cloud armor sitewithout any negative impact to ourbackendthere are no any digits on the bottomgraph but it was a very large attackmillions of requests per secondthe describe it approach has proven itsEffectiveness in practiceit's not just a theoryit workswhat we already achievedwe are sleeping better at night it'svery importantwe Block in automatic mode big DDOSattacks without negative impact to ourbackend and to our clientswe decrease it amount of requests passit to our backend and save money a lotof money because we don't need to scaleup our backend during the DDOS attacksnowuh despite theincreased volume and frequency of DDOSattacks we don't need to change ourinfrastructure often because we have noany capacity issues nowand we have a platformwith those remediation systems thatallow us to improve and develop themitigation systemin the futureabout the futureevery protection its endless battle andwe want to improve itwe plan to reduce the time fromdetection to mitigation of the attackthey think how to improve our detectionalgorithms using AIwe want to create dashboardsVisa saved money not only with the positand blocked requestsand we are developing our system toprotectthe infrastructure from new types ofattacks in the futureforeignI would be happyshare some practice examples but I hopeyou all understand why I didn't do itI tried to shareprinciples and approaches how to buildan effective and reliability ofprotection SolutionsI hope it will be helpful for youis that so thank you very much forattention[Applause]hi everybody I'm here to talk about howto protect that multi-app infrastructureso organizations are building thesedistributed apps and they're spanningmore than one cloud and they'reassembling the best suited componentsand managed Services across these Cloudproviders when you get app ownersbenefit with this feature velocity andtime to Market but at the same time itintroduces some Securities concerns forthe organization and so that's why we'reoffering thismulti-layered security approach toprotect the application and theinfrastructure underneath theapplicationstarting with Cloud firewall we have Faein the audience she's a product managerfor cauliflower wall so this is uhevolving to the cloud next-gen firewallso this is comprised of cloud firewalland intrusion detection this is builtinto the Google Cloud Fabric and itprovides the protection for perimeterand workloads with the leading threatintelligence from Palo Alto and thethreat Intel from mandian Googlemandiantlet me add the next one the next layerof protection is called the cloud secureweb proxy so so this monitors andprovides monitoring and securing the webegress traffic we also have a PM hemight be in this audience I mean ifyou're there anyway if you havequestions for Naveen and Faye feel freeto come through and so this providesprotects your workloads that access theSAS and internetthe next one the next layer ofprotection is the cloud Nat is thisright let me seecorrect okay so this is a managedNetwork address translation service Ihave the PM for cloudnet here we didsorry to draw your attention but it'sall fun and games here so cloudnetprovides a managed Network addresstranslation service and for trafficthat's traversing going out to theinternet and for between the vpcs thismakes Network assetsvery private and simplenext up we have VPC service controlit provides a virtual perimeter aroundyour Google services and helps toprevent the data exfiltration byattackers so that's a very commontechnique by you know ransomware andattackerslastly we have a gke network policy sothis provides a comprehensive securityprotection for your gke workloads sofirst using that cloud firewall that wetalked about and the secure web proxy tocontrol the and protect the trafficthat's going in and out of the Clustersand then lastly we also enhance thenetworkpolicy in kubernetes to provideadditional controls for your workloadsso let me spend a little bit of time totalk about that first layer ofprotection which is like Cloud NGfirewall so this layer of protection isum protects your workloads Cloudworkloads but it provides thatoperational simplicity so I mentionedthis is built by Google cloud and thisprotects that provides a threatprotection for both intrusion detectionIDs and IPS intrusion prevention andthis is enabled by the threatTechnologies from Palo Alto and with thethreatened Intel from Google mandian sothis is a distributed firewall this isbuilt into the Google Fabric and itprovides a Simplicity scale and coverageof perimeter of both the perimeter andthe workloads all without networkchanges all without routing changes sosecurity follows the workloadso Cloud NG firewall provides a uniquehierarchical firewall policies that canbe applied organizationally wide so itcould be applied globally across yournetwork and application layers and itprovides a consistent networks carrypolicy control for youso there's some innovations that we putin in this uh Cloud NG firewall I talkedaboutum IDs and IPS so this has a um throughthe work of a third-party uh tooling wewere able to demonstrate High efficacyfor this uh solution meaning uh thecloudfirewall has shown that it can have thathas a high efficacy across all threatsof severity levels it has the ability toblock attacks against vulnerabilities itcould be malware it could be command andcontrol and again I mentioned this fromthreat Palo also based on Palo AltoTechnologies and it works on encryptingand unencrypted trafficthe another additional feature is theability to provide the Geo and threatIntel and F2 qdn policies so theseadditional controls can block or allowtraffic based on the country or based onthe threat Intel from the Google mandianso this is a along with the controlswith the fully qualified domain namethe last uh feature Innovation that wehave in Cloud NG firewall is this is aunified policy for perimeter andworkloads across layer 3 4 and 7.um it's based on the IEM backed orgwhite tags so it means that because it'sa tag based system you haveinstantaneous control over any infectedsystems so that is uh also releasedah we also have a session uh please comeby right after to see the cloud NGfirewall session it is at 4 pm rightafter this one please join usso the next layer of protection comesfrom cloud secure web proxy as Imentioned so it monitors and secure theegress it ensures that your Cloudworkloads do not connect connect to sayunknown destination why is thisimportant so customers who are tellingus that they don't want to send data tomaybe some unknown destinations maybebecause due to some misconfigurationerror that they madeso the four main reasons for using Cloudsecure web proxy is um you protect thistraffic with a native service instead ofusing a VM and maybe putting thesecurity controls into a VM so this is anative service and it protects thatcloud workload from these maliciousactivities so it inspects the webtraffic and then it blocks the untrustedaccess and it's easy to deploy becauseit's a managed service and it scalesbecause as I managed service and itautomatically updates as wellso this is a very effective if you'reimplementing uh like kind of like a zerotrust principle so this could give youthe granular controls over the webtrafficand so that this could be used forcompliance use cases so meaning thiscould allow you to monitor your usageyou know discover and you know disruptany threats that's happening in thenetwork you can spot command and controltraffic or any malicious data transfersso if the Auditors show up at your dooryou can say that you have implementedthe controls because you have all thelogs to prove thatand let me show you some of the latestfeatures that are latest Innovations inCloud secure web proxy so what's beenadded is uh there's a granular egressaccess policies so this limits thetraffic based on the source identitiesand identities could be tags or serviceaccounts destinations HTTP types headersEtc and then in the second set ofInnovations is support for TLSinspection so meaning you can interceptthe TLs traffic and then you Monitor andenforce the policies and this is alsointegrated with a certificate manager soyou could have certificates that's usedwith the TLs inspectioncloudnetis a managed Network address translationservice so meaning some of the resourcesmay not have external IPS but usingcloudnet you can create these outboundconnections to access the internet andyou can use them in between vpcs so thisworks in line with Cloud firewallthere are two main use cases forcloudnet so maybe some of the workflowsyou don't want to expose to the Internetso this is one use case a second usecase is you might have a group of VMSand you maybe only want to expose onepublic IP address for the whole groupand so this would allow you to havethese netted traffic for the whole groupand then that to on-prem so cloudnet isbuilt also on Google's distributed CloudFabric and it simplifies thisconfiguration operations all withoutforwarding routing changesuh Cloud now actually works with avariety of workloads for example forcould be VM instances without externalIP it could be the private gke clustersit could be Cloud run it could be acloud function app engine instances thatyou want to expose through theserverless VPC so there are someInnovations for cloudnet that's comingaround so the big one is uh Nat forstandard tier meaning you can use nowcloudnet to support the standard tier anetworking egress traffic and and nowyou can also mix and match between yourpremium and standard using the same NatGateway the second Innovation is also inpreview is the private VPC privateinterview VPC Nat so meaning you canhave private IPtranslation for the community Nationsbetween two overlapping you know privateIP resources and they could be indifferent vpcs or even in differentcross regions so those are theInnovations for clouduh VPC let me show you another layer ofsecurity controls so VPC securitycontrolis actually for Google cloud servicesand it prevents the data exfiltration itisolates the services so it makes itdifficult to extract data so for examplethe sensitive data can only be authoraccessed through these authorizednetworks and so this will keep provideyou with the granular controls for saybetween your on-prem and your otherenvironments and meaning allunauthorized networks are blocked andthis works um these operations uh thethis helps with the cloud securityoperations because you can now restrictyour Google service apis based on sayidentities or GEOS and maybe based ontrusted clients so this is just anotherlayer of security control we haveadditional Innovations for this productso there's a two to ten times uhImprovement in scale and the other oneis there's a private address supportwhich is in preview so you can use theseprivate addressing in VPC servicecontrol and again this would provide youmore granular control over differentenvironments say between on-prem and toother environments so that one is inpreviewagain we also have a great session forVPC service control this is in August30th which is tomorrow again 3 30 p.mthe session number is securitythree one uh sorry misspoke security twoone three uh visit the session and hearfrom the other areas of the productmanagers so gke one of the very veryintriguing things a lot how many folksare running gke in the audience justcurious oh very very awesomeum so gke we offer this comprehensivelayered security for GK workloads so wehave both Cloud firewall and Cloudsecure web proxy to protect it inIngress and egress traffic coming in andout of the Clusters and then we enhancethe kubernetes network policy that'salready providing the namespaceisolation so in I spoke a lot about thecloud firewall earlier in gke weactually have full life cycle managementof cloud firewall so includingprotecting the pods and thecommunication you actually don't have todo anything it's full complete full lifecycle managementuh for uh just typically an upstreamkubernetes the general breast practiceis kind of to deny all traffic to a podsand then you can use the concept oflabels uh say maybe everything theylabeled uh project a all the pods inProject a can talk to each other or youmight do something with namespaces likeall the pods and namespace blue I cantalk to each other all the namespace redwon't be able to talk to each other soin this in this case in gke what we havedone is we enhance the network policy intransit with the metadata and we addedlogging to the cloud the networkpolicies and then we also addedadditional Innovations let me talk tothe the kubernetes policy logging inparticular so troubleshooting Networkpolicies uh is is kind of a lot easierbased on what we have done so what wehave done is we kept a record of all thenetwork policy sees and then we actuallyuploaded all of these logs into Cloudlogging so that's an innovation that wehave done to enhance uh you knowupstream kubernetes and the other thingthat we have done is we added thisflexible fqdn matching conditions sowhat we're doing is we're limiting theegress traffic and meaning you couldlook at the picture so all the ones inlet's say the operator defined that theones in namespace blue can talk to theegress traffic and so what we have doneis we've added both thefqdn for both the host name and thedoname domain name so which it makes itpossible for us to protect the gkeworkloads from accessing The Unwanteddomains so in the picture you know allthe pods in the red those are notaccessible you know in the becausethey're in the namespace red so thoseare the things that we have done for gkeuh all both of them are released but forfqedn that's uh in previewso now let me bring Peter back up for toput everything togetherso just to wrap up hopefully you've seenwe've got a broad set of layeredsolutions that allow you first toprotect the global front end frominternet-facing attacks right you've gotCloud DNS for high scale DNS and DDOSprotection Cloud armor for network andapplication layer DDOS protectionrecapture Enterprise for bot fraudprotection and then you know Susan justtook us through all the solutions thatyou have for protecting the applicationinfrastructure in our cloud andmulti-cloud firewall and IDs along withthe great new stuff we're announcing atthe show really the evolution of cloudnext-gen firewall with the Palo Altonetworks technology Cloud Nat forNetwork privacy cloudswip for egress weband egress traffic to other clouds andthen VPC service controls so with thatwe'll stick around afterwards if you'renot feeling like asking a question infront of the whole audience[Applause]thank you"
