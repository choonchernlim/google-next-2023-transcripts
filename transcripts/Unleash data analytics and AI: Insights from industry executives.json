partnersum Executives and the product andEngineering side of things we also havea former googler up here as well withdebonjin we'd like to keep thisinteractive so there's a my care iffolks would like to come up and askquestions at different points we'regoing to go through a series ofquestions but again we'd love to keepthis interactive with this audienceso with that I'm going to kick this offI'm Claude Robinson I lead our dataanalytics partner marketing team and myteam has the luxury of partnering withthese great companies databricks datarobot and mongodb many customers outthere that have deployed the solutionsacross these three organizations and umwithout going to kick it off withintroducing each of these gentlemen sofirst upwe have David Meyer from David didbricksand we have sahirazam from mongodbso David tell us a little bit about yourcompany yeah so I've been withdatabricks we were just talking about itfor about six years it was a lot smallerthenum and you know it's a platform fordoing data and AI togetherand one of the main you know it startedoff with things like spark and innovateda lot on top of that but really it'sfoundational architecture is what wecall the lake house which is taking allthe kind of abilities of a warehouse andputting them directly into the data Lakeand with that you can manage all of yourdata in one place you don't have to moveit data scientists don't have to work ina different stovepipe than datawarehouse people and it yields enormousefficiencies it wasn't possible fiveyears ago but with a lot of advances itis and now we work with a lot of theGoogle fundamental things like bigqueryon the same formats in the lake so youcan do all of your analytics and machinelearning and llms and generational AIall of these things in one place so it'sreally exciting to be here with uh myfriendsall right and quick question for theaudience how many guys looking at databricks today or playing around with itor touching things show of handsawesome and feel free to grab meafterwards if you have any detailedquestionsnext up we have debonjin from data robotso uh you know as Claudia was sayingthis is almost like homecoming I was inGoogle for uh three years runningbigquery which I hear has now becomebigger and some of the other productssome of the other products which waslike lake has now become big lake but Ihave always been a robot and finallyfound the right company to work for indata robot so data robot by the way youknow if you don't know about what we dowe call ourselves the systems ofintelligence it's kind of fancy way ofsaying that we sit between the datalayer and the application layer and weextract Insight from data and we makeapplications more intelligent and youknow if you look at double click thatlittle bit what is that we actually dothere are two fundamental things that wedo one is what I call the AI command andcontrol center there are a lot of ourcustomers who have a lot of models builtover a period of time using variousdifferent tools many of them are kind ofin spreadsheets they are trying tomanage them deploying them in variousdifferent environment is not easy andmonitoring them is a pain in the buttokay excuse my French so what we do iskind of put all of these things intoelectricity history so that people canmanage them from one place we deploythem in whatever endpoints we want todeploy them on and then we manage andmonitor them from a single pin of glassso that's one piece of what we do theother part of it is essentially buildingthose models right so there are ofcourse people have a lot of data and wefeature engineering and featureDiscovery so that we can identify whatare those data points which makes realdifference to people's business then webuild those models and compare them withvarious different Alternatives peoplehave so that they can see which modelsworks best and then make it availablefor deployment so these are the twopieces of what we do and of course wework with both data breaks and mongodband a lot of our customers have thatdata environment and of course withGoogle thank you very much same questionto the audience how many of you guyshave been looking at data robot or kindof kicking the tires show of hands I seea lot of opportunities[Laughter]and the last step we have so here frommongodb I've been working with you andyour team for a while so tell me alittle about your company so here sureso uh thank you for having us and thankyou all for joining um I've been withmongodb leading the product Organizationfor seven or so years I originallyjoined to lead our transition to thecloud so I've been lucky to work withGoogle Cloud for over seven years interms of Shifting our platform from anopen source Enterprise softwaretechnology to a cloud database platformin close partnership with all thehyperscalers so for those of you who arenot familiar mongodb is the leadingmodern operational data store in themarket today we are in all 37 Googleregions I think that's the most recentcount it's constantly changing and wereally serve developers and you knowwith the big wave of generative AI nowpulling ML and models much more to theForefront of operational applicationsthe Live customer experience we'rereally seeing a big acceleration ofadoption of our technology and we'reworking closely with Partners likeGoogle databricks and data robotempowering sort of an end-to-end Loop ofmore intelligent applicationsthank you and again for the audience howmany of you guys are either using orkind of checking out mongodbnice niceso gentlemen we're going to make thiskind of an interactive discussionbetween the three of you so we saw a lotof discussion today from Thomas andothers around gen Ai and the power ofGenera that we're bringing toEnterprisesif an organization is kind of driving astrategy around data and analytics whatdo they need to look at when they'rekind of integrating that with Gen AI forInnovation and growth what are you guysseeingwho wants to start yeah sure I mean youknow that way I can disagree with youso the dnai by the way I mean it is theiPhone moment for the whole world rightI mean AI has been around for a longtime I mean thepeople who have been using AI for a longtime but I have never seen somethinglike this uh in a long long time I wasin an investor conference if you uhmonths back Morgan Stanley and everyinvestor of course asked me about gen AIon the way back the Uber driver quizzedme for half an hour about jnai and Irealized that yeah that's when wearrived he's worried about it replacinghim yeah that's right well you know thatwould be a different kind of jai but uhthe power of Jane AI is you know the wayI kind of view this AI of course can doa lot of things I mean if you look atpredictive AI it has been very veryvaluable in a lot of Industries but it'snot easy to explain it to people right Imean you need some basic knowledge ofmaths or statistics even if you automateeverything that's not the case with jnaiit's texting text out people can veryeasily understand what it is and it'salso very easy to figure out very verylow hanging you know use cases that cangenerate immediate Roi for people rightmaking essentially the workforce veryvery productive and that's what kind ofis so striking about it I mean you knowone of our investors actually alwaystalk about so what is the boardingproblem you are trying to solve AI ofcourse solve a lot of very veryinteresting problem but Jai can solve alot of really boring problem which iswhat is driving a lot of businessinterest in it on the other end of thespectrum there is a lot of very veryinterest interesting problem scientificproblem which can change the way peoplelive their lives or many societalchanges can actually come from that thatis also very very exciting and this isof course a great opportunity for all ofus and I know David you are kind ofwaiting for this I mean I actually thinkthat there is a lot of of courseexcitement about models that's going onI remember you know 10 years back eightyears back everybody was talking aboutwhat algorithm people are using forpredictive AI hyper parameter tuning andall of this none of those matter allthat much right now I think in anothercouple of years which model you're usingis probably going to be less useful andand I think ultimately people haveaccess to all the data that they need inorder to train those models yeahultimately you know it's actually goingto be how do you create value from thesemodels mapping the business problem intoAI problem and actually solving it in away which creates value for the businessis what's going to be where most of theaction is going to be yeah I I agree ina lot of is the the joke of ofdisagreement was he was saying 20 of theproblem is data and I was saying eightypercent he's like you're a data guy ofcourse 95and 95.a colleague of mine with a customeryesterday was describing it as you knowthe the the data platformsyou know obviously there's a lot of thatat Google is the cakeand then there's some great cherries youcan put on it which are the models but Ithink you're I totally agree with thebonding that the the the cultural shiftsand how you're applying ityou can do really really dumb thingswith llmsyou know and you can have a bunch oflike failed projects because they'rejust like whims so the and we'll talkabout this more but like the theobviously you know one problem with llmsis hallucinations but you can change thetraining set and stuff like that withdata that's curated to eliminate thosebut then you need the data to be rightand that's a lot of the problem of theUpstream you know so so a lot of it isgetting your data in a place thateverybody in your ward can leverage itincluding through llms and then figuringout all the you know operationalizationof that which is hardSarah do you want to add on to that yeahit's uh one of the things we'reobserving it's in you know to doLondon's point the idea of models and AIhas been around a long time andcertainly the Gen AI chat GPT boom iscertainly unlocked all of ourimaginations in terms of theapplicability of it and created all thisuh current hype around it but I think ina lot of ways what we're seeing with AIand ml is a shift left you know if yougo back 10 years you saw operations giveway to devops and that shift left intosoftware that automated processes wethen see the same thing happening insecurity you're seeing security movefrom a centralized security team to beembedded in the life cycle ofdevelopment up front so you can managethat much more from a development pointof view I think the same thing isstarting to happen with the move fromlarge-scale training to much more aroundreal-time inference on the backs ofevery development team in all of ourbusinesses needing to think about how AIcan power these smarter applicationexperiences so a big part of what we arefocused on is really democratizing theexperience of taking these models takingthe proprietary data that all of ourorganizations have which in many ways isour core value but making itoperationally capable for any teambuilding amazing software and userexperiences yeah and you know just onewithin databricks we classify these intothree categories and you probably do foryour own business okayokay so there's uh exposing uh you knowco-pilot like chat Bots withindatabricks that's one class so we'reexposing llm to the userwe also have a platform so companies canbuild their own models and llms sothat's giving them the platform to buildtheir own tooling and then we also usethese a lot inside totally invisible tothe customer to run better as a companyand those are kind of whenever we talkabout it at e-staff or whatever we wantto say is it you know type one two orthree to classify them same ones yeahso let me ask you this like if you canlook at the audience and you know with adifferent show of hands of differentplatforms people are looking atlet's say you know individuals aretrying to implement something at theircompany what are some of the keyconsiderations to look at when you'relooking at different data sources anddifferent platforms across you know and Google cloud and data robotand databricks as they're starting outso here you want to take thatyeah I think um you know our lensobviously on the kind of developer oroperational end of the spectrum is howdo we bring the skill set that'stypically been in sort of a centralizedteam Walled Garden specialization ofdata science or ML and embed that now inevery operating team that's building andshipping the Production Services andthere's different organizational modelsand skill set kind of changes that needto happen for that but I think to reallyUnleash the Power of whether it's gen AIor just ml more broadly in anorganization I do think it needs to beviewed as a core competency of a muchbroader set of ecosystem even if thereis a domain Specialist Team you know orthe experts so I think focusing on thatgetting that whether it's a matrix modelor just building up the skill set WithinThese groups certainly is somethingwe've done internally to enable sort ofthe capabilities in our own platform butas I go up to the 40 000 plus customerswe have and see like the best practicethe most Cutting Edge teams don't viewdata science as you know data they throwover a wall to a team that trains it andthen they get a model that's a black boxback back and then they executed they'rereally got that that data science teamembedded just like a designer is anengineering lead is a product manager isas part of that core development processwhat do you see when you're out therekind of looking at that consideration tobuild on those various data platformsusing these Technologies I I think youknow one of the big problems inEnterprises are really the data silosright if you think about you know theassets an organization has it's theircustomers you know various differentphysical or non-physical assets thatthey have their employees and their I.Tassets right and and typically you havethis vertically Integrated Systems whereall of these kind of siled in variousdifferent systems of records and whichis integrated with the systems ofEngagementand you get much more value if you cankind of cut across these variousdifferent silos right so for example youknow you have your data in Salesforcewhich is very useful in figuring out ifa particular customer is going to churnbut that customer is also calling thecall center and if they're havingproblem with the product I think if youcan map this too you get a lot moreintelligence right and I think that'swhat people are trying to figure out howexactly to do that I mean are they goingto put them in a lake housethat would be one way of doing that Ithink you know then they have to keepdoing that all the time and by the waythat's one solution to that other optionwould be to integrate them at themodeling operational data storeand integrate the very modeling there sothat you don't have to move data aroundand all of both of these are by the wayyeahviable good solution so what it reallymeans that you need a system where youhave open interfaces and open dataformat right without that you cannotreally do that and what I would also saythat's kind of a table state for how youbuild this composable system right Imean we also work for example with databreaks and Google in order to dodeeper product integration so that weare not just giving people Lego blockswe fit with each other but also showingthem how to fit them together yep yeah Ithink I think standards and abstractionsare two really really key things so weare talking to I was talking to a largemultinational Bank yesterdayum and they were saying you know theybasically have gone deep in to open AIright and I was like well be carefulbecause there will be a plurality ofmodels we know you know there's Lama twothere's all these other ones and they'regoing to keep evolving right and youmight want to be building your own soyou you want to have the rightabstractionand they said yeah but our developerssay open AI is easy and all the otherplatforms are really hardand that that might have been true for aminute but now we all have thoseabstractions so you can initialize withopenai you can initialize with llama youcan initialize with any type of modelbut unless you do that your business isgonnaget deep tendrils into one modelwhich will be perhaps Irrelevant forsome of your use cases or or not usableso the other pieces to the rightstandards and the right levels ofabstraction and thenyou got to have someone in your legaldepartment get smart on this stuffbecause the problem is it's so easythat it's so easy to really screw up andhurt your IP and get yourself intotrouble so you need to have someoneeducated in likelegal responsible AI different countriesare having different regimes is that'sgoing to affect your practices aroundthese things in the futureyeah we've seen the same thing I mean onone hand we want to make sure we'resafely consuming all these technologiesthat are popping up everywhere and soyou know we want legal we want um I.Tsecurity all the on the governanceprocess but at the same time we wantteams to be independent and move as fastas possible because there's so muchInnovation happening right now sofinding a way to kind of have acentralized group that can at leastshare best practices but still not feellike everything has to be top downstandardized has been a tricky balanceto sort of strike it gets back todistractions and standards exactlyyou're out there talking to customerslike what advantages do you see with youknow kind of Google's core dataplatforms and AI with both bigquery andvertex AI well you know I have of coursea sub corner for bigquery yeah I used toreturn that for some time so uh bigqueryis probably one of the best datawarehousesbut[Laughter]but there are a lot of customers that wework with they have their data inbigquery and what we have done is a verydeep integration with bigquery right sofor examplewe have our feature engineering andfeature discovery that we can push downto bigquery by the way we're doing thatfor data bricks also right so that youdon't have to take data out you canactually do a lot of this filtering workin terms of what are the importantfeatures which is going to drive outcomeinside the data warehouse itself thenyou build the model you can also run themodel within bigquery so that if youwant to do for example batch predictionsyou don't have to take it out and thenwrite it back and not only that I thinkthe difficult thing in all of this AIbusiness is really the monitoring aspectof it right I mean this is what by theway I believe the biggest issue in jnaiI mean you can ask a question to chatGPT you get a nonsense answer you canlaugh at it but when you apply that inan Enterprise setting that's no laughingmatter right and I think it is very veryimportant important to build thoseguardrails and the scaffolding so thatpeople have confidence in the outputthat they're getting it's safe it'saccurate and that's where I see a lot ofcollaboration that you can do with notonly bigquery but also with vertex Aiand we have done some of that andcontinue to do that so here with yourcompany I know you we do a lot withAtlas you know how this is kind of thefirst choice for developers as they'rebuilding new apps and you guys are doingwork with us with bigquery and vertexyou want to add a little bit onto thatyeah I think our collaboration with bothvertex and bigquery has been quiteinteresting that you know we'retypically complementary to both in termsof either vertex sitting on top ofoperational data in orgenerating all this business data aspart of your application stack but howdo we feed that as a source Downstreamto bigquery or to lake house and we'vegot Integrations both ways so that'sbeen a common sort of architecturalpattern that we've seen these days oneof the newer things that we've beenworking on and certainly getting a lotof demand for is everyone's like how doI embed AI in my application well thebig hot thing is Vector storage andretrieval and managing embeddings andyou know the reality is any AI drivenapplication fundamentally is still atapplication it needs transactionalcharacteristics if I need keyword orrelevance based search or you need timeseries capabilities or whatever it mightbe and so a big part of what we'retrying to focus on is how do we simplifythe experience so as you're building anapplication sure you might need a vectorcapability now you may need some searchcapabilities but you also may havemetadata or Source data in your coredatabase should that be four systems orcan we integrate that for a developer ina much more elegant way and Google'sbeen a great partner in driving thatinto the market and partnering with ussince seven years ago when we started onthe platformDavid you want anything under that yeahI mean I think Google's been there sincethe beginning of all of this you knowdatabricks got created out of AcademiaCal Berkeley creating spark but that wasan inspiration to generalize what theysaw happening at Google to run searchlike it's all started back at you knowGoogle and a handful of otherhyperscalers and then you know you knowall of the initial AI stuff inside torun Google has manifested into thingslike vertex so with all of these thingsyou need you need scale you needperformance and you need data at theheart of all of it and that kind ofexemplifies bigquery and uh and vertexso we work deeply with both sets ofTechnologiesum and it's one reason why you know it'sa very fun Cloud platform to partnerdeeply with because of all the originsso like about 10 plus years ago you knowI was kind of this whole in this move ofdigital transformation like let's movestuff to the cloud you guys talked alittle bit about openness like why is anopen data data and AI ecosystemimportant to this audience as this nextphase of digital transformation happensyou want to take that onelookyou have data gravityin the three major clouds all three ofthem everybody does and you need tofigure out how to leverage that andthere's a bunch of toolkits on thisstage to help you with that butfundamentally data has gravityand for example in these Lake formats soyou have a data Lake and they've beenenriched with things you know we createdDelta there's iceberg there's hoodie allthree of those are great formats fortaking all the data in a lake andreadying it for AI and ml in kind ofthese Technologies and the fact is nowthey interoperate because of Standardsthose standards have increased the valueof so many things people have donebecause you don't have to get lock in inthe data itselfand it's it's the core of so much thesedays so basically it future proofs yourInvestments uh the Technologiesunderneath will change the models willrotate the things you can do on top ofthese formats will change vectorembeddings and these kind of things aregoing to transform you know a lot ofthese applications but you knowworking together in in consortiums onthese standards is really important forexample I think there's going to bestandard llm model interfaces so youknow we have our version and data brickswhere you can initialize with open AI orllama or these other ones but we'regoing to standardize that because it'sgood for the industry and then all of uscan work on our core competencies andkind of raise the you know the water andall the boats here float what's this I'msaying therewhat are your thoughts on so you know Itotally agree by the way I I think youknow one of the things that used tohappen is that you have this verticallyintegrated application with data insideit right and when that happens it's verydifficult to cut across and kind of uhyou know pick the Insight whichsometimes acrossresides across this multiple silos rightand the table stake here is reallyhaving a common data format orstandardized data format doesn't have tobe one and a standard API and if youhave that a lot of other things kind offall into place one thing I always tellcustomers before coming to AI I used torun databases and data warehouses Ithink what you should ask every vendorthat how easy it is to move in and howeasy it is to move out and if you havethose two things nailed I think you havethe portability up wherever you want torun it and you will pick the best youknow tools or best data where how thedata Lake possible to do that so that'sthe key in terms of figuring out notonly the data format and API is themigration in and out easy for youyeah I wholeheartedly agree with that Imean a big portion of why um I thinkpeople choose mongodb is thatflexibility and openness you know theoption of having an open source or asoftware version if they have to trainand operate on data that's in the datacenter but then having a unifiedabstraction across Google and the othertwo hyperscalers the ability to spanoperational data across those we've seena pattern emerge quite a bit now whereyou know maybe a application sits on aprimary hyperscale Cloud operationallyserving live users but they want a lowlatency replica to tie into somethinglike Vertex or another upstack serviceto be able to run inference or trainingon that data we've made a lot ofInvestments to make that experience asseamless as possible to make it easy fororganizations to have that flexibilityand the reality is over the Long Hauluser choice and you know flexibility isa key consideration for especially largeEnterprise and you know we've been fromour open source routes kind of reallyfocused on that yeah and I mean theother key we didn't really mention isyou need that for negotiation leveragewith usso if we go look at the real world youguys are out there talking to customersall the time and while we've beentalking some of the slides have beenshowcasing some customerscan each one of you kind of walk methrough a customer that you've talked towho's kind of deployed a data and AIsolution with your solution Google Cloudwhat challenges they were facing beforewhat were the outcomes they achieved byimplementing this platform so yeah I canstart um I use this one in a recentmongodb keynote because I think it's oneof the most fun examples we're workingwith one of the large automakers youwould all know the name and they'repiloting a project right now where theyrecord a bunch of sounds of common carproblems across their you know modelsand years of cars they vectorize thatand store that in a vector store Enginewith mongodb and the idea then is thattheir technicians can record the soundof a car that has a problem do asimilarity search and figure out whatthe com what that symptom is what theroot cause of that'ssound an issue is so it's kind of likethose who have an iPhone it's likeShazam but for car Diagnostics does thatwork for pets yeahbut if you think about it like for thiscar manufacturer they've got first partyand third-party technicians across theglobe their Fleet is global so the ideaof shrinking down the diagnosis timefrom an hour or two or improving theaccuracy and bringing that down toseconds or minutes is huge when youextrapolate the savings the step two isthen saying all right once you know whatthe problem is there's a bunch of eitherdigital or physical manuals that havethe step to step by step instructionsthat the technician follows to repairthe issue well now they're vectorizedthe full text and that to create abasically natural language interface sothey can just say hey this is this soundthis is the step-by-step naturallanguage extension of how you actuallygo fix it so that's kind of one of themost interesting I would say Enterpriseuse cases that we've worked with a morefun one was uh I saw a startup out ofSoutheast Asia sign up for our service afew weeks ago that does personalize fastfashion so use they use gen AI you giveit a bunch of parameters it'll generatea shirt for you or pants or whateveryour address and then they tie the loopwith contract manufacturers so it'llactually go create a version of thatcustom piece of clothing and ship it toyou all in sort of a few minutes so it'staken like the idea of like Zara inthese fast fashion kind of Brands and aleveraging ad to personalize it all theway down to the individual they'vealready been saying with customersthat's interesting yeah I mean it'sfunny because there's a lot you knowthere's only certain ones that arenameable but um you know I thinkGoogle is so foundational from a atechnology perspective we talked abigquery and vertex and like for exampleuh it was the first place that we usedlike a managed kubernetes engine becausethe evolution kind of started at Googleand gke was so was so powerfulum and so customers a lot of customersthat are multi-cloud we see a lot ofthem bringing more and more gravity toGoogle because of these performancecharacter and what they can do and it'slike uh you knowprocesses that might have taken 24 hoursbefore working collectively with both ofour respective Engineers getting it downto 30 minutes you know going from batchto streaming because the power of thetechnology and the scale is there andthe TCO benefits are are are clearespecially with those reduction ofpipelinesum so like the the the being able to uha lot of times you knowthere's there's a lot of regions and alot of cloudsum and then where where it's possible todo it in Google with these Technologieswe see people seeing enormous benefitsinto banjo so um you know I also cannotprobably name the customer but it's amajor health care provider and by theway the demo is kind of running in ourbooth if you want to go and check it outI went down to see the logo then I don'tknow if we have the logo any kind of amaster logothe URLso what they really do two things one isa triage system so when customers comeinto an emergency room the informationabout their past visits as well as thedoctor's notes are all stored in variousdifferent Google platforms includingbigquery and we kind of picked thatinformation from bigquery and thevectorized version of that from a vectordatabase and we actually do two thingspredict what is the triage level iswhether it is critical or you know otherlevels that we have I think there arefive levels and when we have to schedulethat those are the two things that youcome up with and produce a summarizednote for the emergency room doctorexplaining what the issue is and whatare the things from the past visit andthe medical history they need to beaware of that we generate automaticallyand on the way back when or on the wayout when the patients are actuallydischarged we predict their readmissionprobability How likely that they aregoing to be re-admitted and why and thencreate essentially a discharge sheetwhich tells the patient and thedischarging nurse you know in a nicelywritten English paragraph rather than alot ofnumerical data that these are the thingsyou have to be careful about and if youdo ABC then it's going to reduce yourprobability of getting re-admitted tothe hospitalit's actually a pretty interesting sothat's the Demos in your booth yes comedown see you laterwhat three general what industries areyou seeing take the most advantage of AIanalytics right now which ones need tocatch upso the four I mean you know from ourbusiness I mean it's a snapshot noteverybody is probably the same the fourprimary Industries we have FinancialServices which is really a Data Businessthere's a lot of AIML there and they aregetting more into gen AIHealthcare retail and Manufacturingright those are kind of the primaryindustry segments that you see but thereare also others for example there is alot of AIML used in oil and gas there isa lot of piml used in telcos for exampleso those are the other areas I've seenyeah it's funny because the theverticals you just listed were ourbiggest for AI and ml kind of until llmsand now there's no it's totallyubiquitous that's right that is true youknow you can't have a conversationthat's right without addressing thatthing because it generalizes it toanything humans can do it becomes moreproductive yeah that is absolutelybasically the same thing we've seen Imean certainly Financial Services HealthCare retail I mean fraud and all thosethings they've been true for 20 yearsbeen using this rightum I think right now everyone'sinterested in it from you know newstartups that are spinning up all theway to you know established Brandsacross every verticalLord's recommendation be to the audienceyou know if they're looking to deploysomething to kind of scale moredata-driven decisions and uncoveryinsights from what they have today likewhat what are those steps you would givethem to kind of move forwardso you want to take that one yeah Ithink umI'll maybe take a bit of a controversialstance on this that's uh mongodbish Ithink the idea of getting insights fromyour data is boring and 10 years old Ithink it's about how you get thoseinsights and actually turn it intoexperiences for your business or yourend customer that allow decisions to bemade faster in an automated way or todeliver a more delightful customerexperience or to drive a more efficientbusiness outcome you know I think for along time getting insights for your datamen people like me look at a dashboardand make a decision and that takes youknow a couple hours to a few weeks toget that Insight now I think it's abouthow do we shift that left and reallymake that something that everyone canexperience to differentiate in themarket yeah I think you hit on so manyvaluables even as a consumer I've in thepast you know doing any type of StockInvesting I'd go and do my research buystocks here and there now they've got AISolutions where it'll go and researchevery analyst report press releaseeverything that's out there that I don'tI can't even do human it would take meyears to do and make buying decisions inreal timeI think what we tell customers to startfrom value and walk backwards from thereto figure out what is that that you needto create right whetherum you know it is a business decisionyou want to make whether it is assetpricing that you want to settle orwhether it is for example a triage callyou need to make you have to firstfigure out what that business problem ismap it to an AI problem then map it towhatever data that you need and whateverETL pipelines you need to build if youwalk backwards from that value I thinkyou will see the outcome lot morequickly and that will make it easier forpeople to establish why they need tospend money on technology right I meanthat has some time become an issueyeah I meanagain the danger is it's so easy it's soubiquitousyou yourself are going to throw it at adumb idea just because there's so manyit is it's hard to figure that one thingthat's kind of uh we found iskind of counterintuitivethat the the less human aspects of thechat bot things sometimes haveremarkable Fidelity like for example uhthere's there's code that we haven'tupgradedeverywhere because it's life but but butby moving between like spark versions orto a data frame API from a rdd API it'sshockingly perfect at so like there'sthings that are more mechanical innature that have a true answerthat it can be shockingly effective atit and then it can also be great at thekind of soft like research type thingswhich can save people a lot of time butthat's less quantitativequantifiable so if you pick somethingthat's more kind of hard skill in naturewhich you might not think of llms ashard skill based you can prove the ROIso fast that you can get funding formore similar things and the the trainingset is often right there in the in thepublic domain we've seen a similar thingI mean for our business a big portion ofwhat we focus on is modernizing off ofOld Legacy technology yeah we found llmsreally effective at taking a look at oldyou know SQL codes stored proceduresstuff that's incision end of lifewarehouses the person who wrote it's nolonger even working at the company andthen spitting out sort of a modernversion of that either for it all of ourdevelopers use it to be more productiveyeah yeah that stuff is so powerful forwhat role are you guys seeing withgovernance and with data management thenew era of AIus is like sweepingly broad questionsumwell I don't think you can really do itwithout AI I'm saying AI inside of yourgovernance like uh all the all thearchaic ways to crawl data and detectiveit's you know PCI Dataare likeso so manually intensive compared towhat you can do with some of these newermodels so like data tagging Discoverygovernance seeing people do the wrongthings with data through Discovery andtagging with llms is so powerful like wehave we have this huge data set in thesystem we call log food with all theTelemetry over timealmost no table has a descriptiondo you know how hard it is to govern acatalog when no table has a descriptionyou can generate bang on descriptionsusing almost no GPU CPU resource inseconds with these models and your wholeorganization gets better now thegovernance teamcan do their job with a lot moreFidelity so like just bake it insidebecause you have too much data you haveno idea where it is what it is or whouses it and that problem is a lot moretractable they areyou know it probably goes Cuts both waysI think I totally agree with you I meana lot of things that we didn't knowwhere things are and what they are youcan classify them now on the flip sideof it there is probably a lot of datasitting on various different placesthere are sensitive data people didn'tknow how to access them search them andyou can actually find them now yeahright so I think you have to be carefulabout how we make itaccessible to people for example if youjust take Enterprise search for exampleright I mean you want to create thisembedding and the vector databases andyou know of course various differentdata elements are various differentaccess control and you have to make surethat the search that you're developingis also at hold otherwise whatever datayou have available in Enterprise nowthrough a bot is accessible to everybodyelse or in the public domain or in thepublic domain right and other side of itI mean probably a more complicated thingthat people don't know what data thesellms are trained on yeah right and theyinadvertently might expose you to youknow sometime legal issues where theygive answers which probably should notbe available to you right so there are alot of tricky issues that you need toaddress and that probably is going toone of the big areas of exploration afun little thing databricks did wellfirst of all we wanted to show that youcould have a lot of Effectiveness with asmall model so we open sources modelcalled Dalium but it needed a training set that youcould commercially use right so our CEOAli told everybody in the company towrite questions and answers one week andthen we use that to open source in acommercially viable way this trainingset 5 000 questions and answersum but the funny thing is like peopleask us about Dolly all the time becauseit was good PRum but don't use the dolly model thedolly model is no good for your realbusiness applications a training setthough use it you can use it for anycommercial purpose and it's inside llamabecause it's very useful so like the thethe the training data is very criticaland knowing being having transparencyexactly what data sets were used totrain the models you're using isimportantwell gentlemen I want to thank you allfor your timeum thank you everyone here for surethese guys will be available for alittle bit if you have questionsthank youforeign"
