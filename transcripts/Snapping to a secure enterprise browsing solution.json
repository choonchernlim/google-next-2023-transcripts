by some Securityleaders at snap that will be talkingabout their experiences deploying theseSolutions across the organizationso today's agenda is going to be in twodifferent segments in the first segmentNewton and I are going to cover what isan Enterprise browser what type ofsecurity benefits can you get out of oneand we'll show you our security featuresthat are built directly in Chrome andthe Google admin console to give you agood sense of the security capabilitiesthat are available therethen we're going to transition over to acustomer Spotlight where we will haveNick Riva head of a corporate securityengineering at snapand Mark laubenderwho's a security Tech lead and engineerat snap to come and speak to us abouttheir experiences I have a few questionsprepared for Nick and Mark but we mayalso have a little bit of time at theend to cover any audience questions thatwe might have so if you think ofsomething interesting please keep it forthe end and we'll try to we'll try tocover it in in the session in the panelso with that let's kick off with alittle bit of context so the way we workhas been changing quite dramaticallyover the last few years so in 2022about 49 percent of workers wereactually working in a hybrid modeadditionally about 29 of users werestill fully remote or were fully remotethat's a lot of time that is spentoutside of the the confines and thesecurity of the traditional corporateNetwork additionallynow the amount of time that users arespending in the browser continues toincrease quite drasticallyso we've seen that up to 71 percent ofusers time on the on the device whenthey're at work is spent in the browserthat's a ton of time spent in thebrowser and that's really why it'simportant to think about the role thatthe browser can play hereand so we've really seen the role of thebrowser revolving over the last fewyears it's really come from being justan access point or a window to the webfor so many people to actually beingsomething of a productivity enabler forEnterprises and that's why a lot ofEnterprises are starting to think aboutwhat type of benefits that they can getfrom their browser what type ofenvironment that they need to build fortheir their employees in the browser andwhat we're going to talk about today ishow the browser can also be a criticalsecurity layer as part of your securitystrategy in your Enterpriseand really at Google the way that we seethis is that the role of the browser isto protect your corporate data whileyour users are working securely fromanywhere and from any device and whenI'm talking about protecting yourcorporate data what I mean is thebrowser can play a massive role in howyou actually prevent your Enterprisesfrom suffering against data loss it canactually play a huge role in thevisibility that your Enterprise has intosecurity incidents and events it canplay a big role in allowing you to lockdown the browser to exactly the thingsthat your Enterprise policies allowadditionally your users when they'reworking securely the browser has amassive role to play there we've alreadyseen a lot of security benefits from theprotections that are available viapreventing malware downloads viabrowsers for many years now the browseris increasingly playing a role inpreventing phishing in these in thesecases and the browser is also quicklybecoming an area where it becomes mucheasier for administrators to enable zerotrust and enable the right level ofsignals to the the applications andcontext so that you can make reallystrong attestations at the time ofallowing access to your applicationsand really at Google that's what we'vebuilt and that's how we've approachedhow we've been developing Chrome we'vebeen thinking about what securityfeatures that we need as an organizationand over the years we've been bringingout these security features to also beavailable to administratorsacross many different Enterprises and sotoday we're going to peel back the onionon some of these these differentcapabilities if you're interested in anyof these capabilities you'll get areally good sense from this talk ofwhat's available right now in Chrome howyou can leverage it and so with that I'mgoing to hand it over to Newton thatwill take us through zero trustthank you Phil and thank you to all forattending this sessionover the years Google has pioneered manysecurity Conceptsone that you might be familiar with iscalled Beyond callBeyond Corp is Google's zero trustapproach to Enterprise security and itreally kick-started the zero testtransformation across the Enterprisewe have been working really a hard tobring all the Beyond Corp zero trustsecurity capabilities directly into theChrome browser really creating Google'ssecure Enterprise browsing solutionit is super simple for it administratorto control access to application tomitigate data acceleration risk and toprotect your users from online threatsif I told you that you don't need toinstall an agent on deviceor you don't need to go and configurefirewallsall you need is Chrome browser on thedevice which is already installed onmillions of deviceswith our zero test security capabilitiesdirectly built into the Chrome browseryou can ensure that wherever the usersare or the type of device they are usingthey can only access your sanctioned SASapplications and your corporate webapplications from the Chrome browseryou can configure your policies in a waythat only from the Chrome browser let'ssay you can access Google workspaceSalesforce or even your sap applicationthat is running in the data centerwith our agentless approach with chromechrome can also collect security postureof the device user and the browser whichyou can then use to really craft yourzero trust access policiesyou can say that heythe users coming from the Chrome browsercan access Salesforce only if they haveEnterprise certificate installed on adevice if the if the device is runningparticular AV version and many many morewe also wanted to ensure that yourexisting investments in the securityvendors like EDR vendors or emm vendorscan be fully utilized as you craft yourzero trust access policieswith our Beyond cop Alliance we haveintegrated with the leading EDR and emmvendors in the industry whether it isVMware AirWatch jams InTune uh Cloudstrike Lookout checkpoint and many manymoresorry maybe I didn't put that slide butso here's the next one which is arounddata loss preventionso as userswork on the weband perform various actions like uploaddownload copy paste printon the sensitive data that they haveaccess to you can Define the policieswhere you can monitorone or block the usersas they perform these various actions onthe sensory data based on differentconditionsyou can block download of sensitive dataon personal devices you can blocksensitive upload of data to unsanctionedSAS applications you can control copypaste of sensitive data in and out ofthe browserwith Google's hundreds of pre-builtcontent detectors and ml classifiers wecan detect sensitive data and alsodifferent types of documents where theparticular document is a law document isit a patent document or even source codefor that matterso with all this we also want to talkabout we are differentiating featurewhich is what we call as a context awaredata protectionso we talked about the on the previousslide how Chrome helps us to collect thesecurity posture in the agentless waynow you can bring all that context withyour DLP rules you can say that I wantto block download of certain types ofsensory data only on certain type ofpersonal devices but maybe you can youwant to allow it in certain cases sothat the employees can actually gettheir work doneso let's look at a quick demohere we are going to define a policy aDLP policy we're going to say that we'regoing to block download of any corporatedataon certain types of devices and we'llstart to craft that and we're going toapply that to two ous here again allthis is done in the admin console let'sapply that to browsers and usersand as you go to the next slide nextscreen here you can apply this tocertain Chrome actions here we'll applyto the file download and printand now you can define a DLP policy onthe context let's keep the DLP policybroad for this demo say that all thecorporate data now again you can go andcustomize this the way you want it andwe'll apply this to unmanaged Chromebrowsers so that's the context we'rebringing that is this browser managed ornot and then we're going to use thatcontext and as we discussed we are goingto warn the user this time not block buton the user and let's go ahead and savethe policyand now look now let's go and look atthe user flowso here we have a user who is logged inusing unmanaged Chrome browser accessingthe corporate data in this case driveand when the user goes and downloads thedata soas per the policy we are going to warnthe usernowthat's the file that's been downloadedand you see the warning uh in in certaincases you can also tell that hey you canprovide me justification if you want touse this file and they can provide ajustification to use that file and onthe other side you have a Chrome browserwhich is fully managed Chrome browserand as user logs in there and downloadsthe file user can download file based onthe policy okay this is a simple examplewhere we brought in the context ofwhether the browser is managed or notand help you craft a DLP policy you canextend this further based on yourEnterprise security needsnow as users work on the web usingsecure Enterprise browsing solution youwant to define the policies to protectthese users from online threads likephishing malware ransomware EtcGoogle's safe browsing today protects 5billion plus devices dailybuilding on the strong Foundation ofstrip browsing we have enhanced itfurther to really provide increased userprotectionso that fromthe dangerous websites by doingreal-time URL scanning from Risky filedownload without advanced malwarescanning and also enhancing ourextension securitywe've really built a whole pipeline ofreputation analysis static analysis anddynamic analysis based on a cloud-basedsandboxing so that we can detect andprotect your users from day Zero attacksso in summary we have all the policiesusing of Beyond Corp threat protectionpolicies that you can use to protectyour users from online threatsyou can't really control if you can'tsee and you don't have data and inEnterprise security we always know thatvisibility is a key tenant for itwith our secure Enterprise browsingsolutionwe have now enabled Chrome to collectTelemetry data for various interestingsecurity events like potential dataexploration application usage andInsider riskthese eventscan be viewed and analyzed directly inthe console or if you are using the Simtools like Chronicle or Splunk you candefinitely forward all these events toyour sim toolswhat we have seen is most of ourcustomers start their Journey with thisstep because once you go and enable thisyou get a comprehensive view into yourdata leakage and in inside risk whenthey are using the secure Enterprisebrowsing solutionbut we wanted to make this even simplerfor all our customers to get started soso today I'm really excited to announcethat BCE customers will not be able toactivate and enable security insightsand reporting for Insider risk and dataexfiltration with just one clickso you can go to the console and you canenable this with one click and behindthe scenes will go and enable a set ofchrome connectors to collect all thesecurity telemeter data and then bybased on Google's default DLP rules andcontent detectors will detectpotential data exploration and Insiderrisk and will show that all in thereports and the dashboardsso why don't we go and see this how it'sgoing to workso this is where you go and you enableit and that's literally the one clickyou just enable thisand that's what it takes to enable thiscapabilityafter that you can look at variousgraphs and kind of the interesting onesare you can look at who are the riskyusers in your organization you can lookat the domains where the sensitive datais being transmitted and you can alsolook at what type of sensor data isbeing transmitted is it the SSN numbersthat are getting exfiltrated is thenames and email addresses you can lookat all these dashboards and as Imentioned earlier you can forward allthese events to your sim toolsas an Enterprise you definitely want tocontrol what version of the Chromebrowser are your users usingyou also want to make sure that as thenew updates become available you testthem out before you roll them out toyour usersbased on your timelines you also want tocraft different policies for yourbrowsersChrome browser Cloud management helpsyou do all of this and a lot moredirectly from the cloud for all theplatforms so the Chrome is installedit's Windows Mac Linux IOS and Androidit is super simple to get started withChrome's cbcm where you can crafthundreds of policies for the browser andthey will become available on yourbrowser fluid in secondswhat we want to do is also we can go andlayer in security policies on top ofyour browser policies the policies thatwe talked about for zero trust AccessData protection and threat protectiongiving you a comprehensive adaptablepolicy management for your entire secureEnterprise browsing solutionlet me bring Phil back up here to talkabout more about Chromeso thank youso I'm going to talk about one moretopic that's very top of mind forEnterprises and that's extensionsecurity Now extensions and Enterprisehave a bit of a love and haterelationship and what I mean by that isthatusers and users in an Enterprise tend tolove them because it makes them moreproductive it allows them to customizetheir workflows to the ways that theywant to work but on the Enterprise sidethat comes with a lot of security risksbecause the same powerful capabilitiesthat come shipped with those extensionsalso need very powerful permissions thuscreating some risks for Enterprisesand that's why in Chrome browser Cloudmanagement we've invested in making anumber of tools available to Enterprisesto help you manage that in a very simpleway that way you can give your userswhat they want while giving you thecontrols that you need to make sure thatthis is being done in a safe way andthis is available to all Enterprisesthat are interested in this you do nothave to pay to be able to use this sothis is really a great way to getstarted get visibility around extensionsand then start managing themand so as part of these tools that we'vemade available we've done things likebeing able to provide extensionpermission insights so you're able tosee actually what type of permissionsextensions requests and as part of theextension list that's available you canalso pin extensions to a certain versionif you're worried about updates toextensions causing additional risks toto your Enterpriseadditionally we've created an inlineflow where you're able to have yourusers request extensions if you're in aneed maybe a highly regulated industryor you need to take a very close controlover extensions you can actually haveyour users request extensions you canhave time for your security teams toactually review these extensions priorto allowing them to roll outand this comes with actually someinteresting Dynamic capabilities thatwe'll demo in in the next slide and thenfinally we have tools that make it veryeasy for you to take an approach toforce install extensions across yourorganization to create that uniformemployee experience or also to blockextensions that just really don't fit sowhat you'll see on the next slide isjust how easy it is to add someadditionalsecurity posture based capabilities tothis and what you'll see is anadministrator that takes an extensionandcreates a rule that says if thisextension starts to request additionalpermissions maybe permissions that mightbe more dangerous like requesting proxysettings it will be blockedand so what you see here is theadministrator going into theconfiguration panel for a specificextension rule they click on customizethey can choose any of the securitypolicies that an extension can requestand say if this extension ever requeststhe proxy policy Please block it and sothis also allows you to manage risk in away that's not changing your existingenvironment that adds additional controlover what an extension can or can't doand that really allows you to easilyincrease the level of security acrossyour organizationnow in this next example you'll get asense of the amount of information thatan administrator has when it comes tomaking good decisions about the securityposture of an extension so by going tothis extension list you're able to seeall of the usage across your Enterprisefor specific extensions drill down intowhat permissions an extension isrequesting but you can also make use ofthird-party services for judgingextension risks so we've built inconnectors that allow you to connectdirectly to popular tools like spin dotai's extension review tool and also CRexcavator so if you're using some ofthese tools to help you gauge the riskof an extension they're immediatelyembedded in the in the admin console andyou can call out to those very veryeasilyand so really if there's something thatyou should take away from this talk isthat the browser is really quicklybecoming this core platform whereproductive work is happening and as suchit's very important to also think aboutthe security that you can add to thatthat critical foundational layer thebrowser is definitely one of these toolsthat's available across all of theseplatforms and so this gives you a chanceto build a uniform set of securitypolicies across all of the devices thatmight be deployed in your organizationand so with that I would like to inviteNick and Mark on stage to to talk withus about their experiences using thiswe're very fortunate to have thembecause Nick and Mark have been usingthese tools for quite some time so Ithink it will be a very insightfuldiscussion so welcome Nick and Markthanks for having us yeah happy to behereso I'm gonna I'm gonna start off with aneasy one Nick for you which is whyChrome so why did it make sense for youto look at the browser to help secureyour Enterprise environment yeahlook we're an engineering company butwe're also a sales and marketing companyand most of our employees live theirwhole corporate I.T experience throughthe browser which is Chromewe also have some parts of ourleadership team that are from Googlethat have written books on browsersecurity such as the tangle Web writtenby Michael zalewski who's previously ourVP of security before retiringand we've placed a strong emphasis onthe browser as a result of that and weactually feel the Google securityprogram and capabilities are are verystrong and I think better than a lot ofother vendors they place a lot of trustand confidence in Google just as asingle canonical example to referencethere's a Google project called projectzero that tracks zero days so I thinksome of you probably are familiar withthis it was a really an iconic projectthat was launched in 2014 now it's beenrunning for nearly 10 years and so aheadof this session I actually studied thedata around number of rce's discoveredin various products including GoogleChrome and the time to remediation it'svery important rightour whole world is remediation bound theaverage time of remediation for mostproducts including non-browser productsbut just for sake of the argument wasabout 15 days from a zero day Google'sChrome remediation was6.04 daysthat's really impressive that's morethan two times faster and so if we wereto pick a browser for the company thatwe place a lot of trust and confidencein using Google Chrome with six six dayremediation from a zero day droppingis world classso for us it's a no-braineryeah thank you for that and I know theteam puts a lot of emphasis on makingsure that we get security right and so Ithink a lot of people will be very happyto hear that referenceum let's actually switch over to uhbrowser management so you've been anearly user an adopter of our managementtools and when it comes to managingChrome so tell me a little bit aboutyour experience when it comes tomanaging Chrome browser what do you useit for what kind of benefits you get outof it yeah we've been using CBC on theChrome browser management for going onthree years now we use it to manage theversion of Chrome that's deployed wealso use it to enforce updates andpatching to Chrome we also use it forextension management we we use it topush a endpoint verification extensionthat we use as part of our customsolution around device trust is what wecall that so we'll talk about that a bitmore Mark we'll talk about that a bitmore we're using it now for DLPprevention the feature that you that wetalked about on the screen we have thisin enabled and we're running this andwe're seeing improvements in userhygiene and behaviors as a result ofthat we're we're full inthat's greatum actually yeah let's switch over toMark now and talk zero trust for aminute so at snap you have aninteresting approach to how you'rehandling zero trust so can you tell us alittle bit more about that and how thesesolutions that people have seen todaykind of fit in yeah definitely soum we at snap we have a pretty customintegration with Bianca Enterprisethat's not out of uh we didn't reallywant to have us get some integration youknow if we had IEP in the very beginningwe probably would have used AIP basedSolutions but um you know we were prettyfar Advanced when IQ came out we had uhyou know about half of the things thatwe we needed in order to have a zerosresolution so you know the things thatyou actually need in general uh wordingis like you need a nothing machineidentity you need a device inventory youneed some place to actually Defineaccess policies and then you need someplace to enforce those access policiesand access proxy and at snap we had anaccess proxy and I had bias inventory sopulling out ripping out our solution andputting in the IEP based solution Iwasn't really going to work we also hada bunch of custom authentication schemesthat only our access proxy actuallyunderstood so we had to find a way toactually have IEP work together with ourown access proxy and fortunately we havea pretty good working relationship withGoogle and we involved Google at thevery beginning of the design phase andactually came up with a pretty coolsolution and you know looking back on itit seems pretty simple but at the timewe had no idea what we what we needed todo but our solution is actually two hopsand our production security teamactually helped us out a lot in thisthis design and this implementation butyeah a request is generated from one ofour machines going to a back-end serviceit's going to go through IAP first IEPis going to wrap that request with allof the access levels that we've definedthat it actually has passed and thenit's going to ship that request off toour internal access proxy forenforcementum and what we wanted to do in the verybeginning is we wanted to restrictaccess to back-end Services just to uhcompany own devices and with the apisthat Bianca group Enterprise actuallyhas available it was really really easyto build out a company node inventory sowhat we do is we we take our internaldevice inventory and compare it toGoogle's admin device inventory and thenthe intersection of those two lists isactually our company inventory and wehave just started actually enrichingthose device signals with our own customHealth score and again with the biancarpEnterprise apis that are available to usit is really easy to actually add thisand this custom Health score is computedby known vulnerability status per deviceand that's specifically operating systemupdate status and in the near futurewe're going to add criticalvulnerability status from our ourvulnerability scannerum but yeah that is pretty much our uhentire uh what's it called our entiresetup for Bunker Enterprise in thefuture we actually want to you knowstart increasing those device attributesthat we're collecting and adding them toour access decisions you know stuff likeencryption status or you know passworduh password policy or even our uh thehealth of our tools that we are runningon every single one of our devicesum the idea is you know if like your ifyour device is in sending it blocks toyour log aggregator for some reason youprobably shouldn't have access to all ofour you know really sensitive uh datauntil that's that's fixedum yeah yeah that's uh that's veryinteresting thank you for thatum it strikes me that we're here at nextit's impossible to Walk The Hallswithout seeing the word Ai and wehaven't said AI yet in this entiresession let's change that so let'schange itum so Nick so yeah it's obviously a bigtopic here yeah also AI while it hasgreat possibilities when it comes tohelping employees be more productive andand really increasing productivity italso comes with some risks so can youspeak to how you've been using some ofthese Technologies to help you mitigatesome of those risks to AI yeah look Ithink the advancements in gender of AIin the last 18 to 20 months are careerchanging for Security Professionals uh II can't tell you how many requests we'vegotten from the company to do variousforms of generative AI Integrationswhether it's a slack Bond integrationwhether it's a a like jira ticketingflow type of integration whether it'stooling that's more AI optimized whetherit's just use of open ai's chat GPT youknow for corporate purposes and so we'retrying to figure this out as we go so weactually shipped a policy on this uhabout a week ago we worked with thatlegal team for nearly four months onthat the policies in place now and thenwe've also shipped some enforcements forcertain high-risk AI usage such as usingchat2pt to send source code from a snapmanaged browserwhich generally we probably shouldn't bedoing right uh we weren't on the Sprintright for now we don't block on it yetuh but as a result of just this featurebeing enabled for probably the last likefour or four to five weeks we've seenabout a 50 decrease in the number ofusers attempting to do so so we thinkthe warnings are working uh and this isall a matter of the DLP feature setthough that we we talked about a periodprior to this and our plans are reallyto expand this to all other sensitivedata transfer attempts at snap throughChromeum and the beauty of all this is as asyou talked about it just works we don'tneed to employ another agent we don'tneed another vendor we don't needanother context to manage it's allthrough Chrome and it's really it'sfairly easy to set up I think it's kindof magical and so are you detectingspecifically source code yeah Sourcecodes source code legal docs andfinancial Docs the the first set ofcategories that we started with and as Imentioned just in four or five weekswe've seen a decrease in in attempts sowe we believe the work the the warningsare workingand that's great so that's making use ofthese you know very customizable DLPrules that are availableum all right so let's switch over toMark and and continue talking a littlebit about data loss so obviously dataloss prevention is a is a big concernfor Enterprises tell me a little bitmore about kind of plans for where youtake this from here yeah so um you knowlike Nick said you know we with a roleout of cbcm we were able to really uhsimplify our whole browser strategy intojust uh just Chrome and we are just nowrealizing the impact or that should beuh the power of what these GOP rules canactually doum what we want to do in the verybeginning is we want to just uh you knowremove those uh those out of band orcompletely out of policy workflows thatwe've we've been noticing you knowthings like um uh you probably shouldn'tbe sharing a very very top secretdocument to anywhere that's not you knowGoogle Drive for instance we want toblock those workflows there's a lot oflow-hanging fruit that is out there thatwe are noticing because we we haveenabled a bunch of these uh these rulesin audit mode that we haven't got gottento yet and we really need to get to thatum but a lot of our systems teams areactually finding some really creativeways into using these DLP rules and it'sDLP logs our application security teamactually was interested in creating ainternal secret scanner for uh for awikis and what it will do is it'll it'llyou know scan for all the downloadsuploads paste events into our wikis andif it's a credential it'll either blockit or warn the user and then warn asecurity team member that you know thissecret needs to be rotated our DNR teamis actually pretty interested iningesting the Chrome log logsand what they want to do is they want tomake sure that no user is reusing theircorporate passwordShady Shady site and if they do you knowwe can actually notify them if they needto rotate their passwordum for us for corporate security weactually have an out-of-band use casefor these uh these rules where itinvolves a SAS security at scale and youknow at snap we kind of follow theindustry standard we're going to unifyif the user wants using SAS applicationwe review it make sure you know it'sbeing used in the most secure way butafter that we really don't have anyvisibility into how this application isbeing used and with these DLP roles inaudit mode we actually get to see we geta bunch more dimensions and measure thesensitivity of the actual application wecan answer like a bunch of questions wecan answer uh you know how many approvedand approved or even denied applicationsare still being used uh you know whatusers inputting or downloading data fromyou know SAS application B what usersuploading information to SAS applicationC what we want to do with these uh theselogs is we actually want to build outsome sort of a data map and figure outhow our data how our corporate data isactually flowing on the web on all theseSAS applications and then with that wecan kind of create a Baseline and thatshould inform us what DLP rules the wewant to create afterwards you knowanything that falls out of that Baselinewe probably should either notify orblock you know if uh if an engineersuddenly uh inputted a 10 000 creditcard uh you know numbers into a designapplication that should probably beblockedum but yeah it's really exciting to seeuh you know not just the blocking andwarning features but also theout-of-band things that we can actuallydo with these hmmso it strikes me that snap is really atthe Forefront when it comes to deployingsome of these security Technologies soNick do you have any kind of partyingadvice or advice for for SecurityProfessionals that are maybe starting tolook at these as options yeah I thinkChrome is sometimes seen as a consumerproduct and a lot of the Securityleaders that I talk to in my my channelsand linkedins and things like this thatmaybe don't recognize the power ofGoogle Chrome for the EnterpriseI honestly think it's it's an UNS kindof an untold story right and there'sthere's sort of you know if I can namedrop a little bit there's there'scompetitive companies like Talon they'redoing something similar but I don't Ihonestly don't think it's necessary ifyou use a Google Chrome correctly andyou make use of the feature sets like wehave like we're full in and we're goingto do much more as Mark said right thisis all part of our 24 road map that heoutlined and so I really just invite theroom you know because it's purely frommy my goal of protecting uh corporatedata and sharing and sharing some wisdomis like really take a look at thefeature site it's really powerful theGoogle's Google's product managementengineering teams are constantlyinnovating thank you gentlemen and thepower of Google security or is is sostrong and so robust that we have a lotof confidence in in being this being sofocal to our strategy and I don't seethat changing anytime soonall right and what about you mark do youhave any advice as you've kind of lookedat some of these Technologies what wouldyou like to share with SecurityProfessionals I am definitely a bit moreI've been wearing the weeds than theNick is and uh if I have any advice Iwould say just start early you knowyou're gonna you're gonna find some uhsome pumps in the road and it's betterto find those early and uh you knowdon't uh don't don't go too fast eitheruh you know don't uh don't block yourusers from actually uh you know doingtheir work uh just to go slow and justlook at the information as it comes yeahall right well thank you so muchgentlemen for for joining us on stageand speaking about your experiencesforeign"
