salesdirector for Google workspaceand I've had the pleasure of Hostingtoday's session on the new era of thenew era of work with duete I and Googleworkspacethis session should give you moreinsight into insights on duet AI the usecases and how our customers are using itusing it to improve their internalprocesses and the products they providetheir customersum we'll we'll start with a brief introin terms of into dnai and why it matterswill then spend about 20 minutes hearingfrom our panelists and how they on howthey're using generative Ai and Googleworkspace to improve their businesseslastly we'll hand it over to you theaudience for 15 minutes for some q a soplease get those questions readyI trust you will gain a lot of valuableinsights from today's sessionbefore we get started I'd like tointroduce our panel our panelists todayI want to start off with zoha if youwould mind it wouldn't mind introducingyourselfthank you I'm Zohar yardeni I'm thechief product officer of the notworldwide and we are a large weddingcompany so we help couples plan theirwedding across the world over 16countries and we do this by connectingcouples to wedding professionals andproviding a bunch of toolsgreat thank you thank you very much Sohonext I'd like Sean Baker to introducehimself good morning everyone my name isSean Baker I'm the chief technology andSenior information security officer forthe Uniformed Services University of theHealth Sciences which most of you haveprobably never heard of it's the U.Sdepartment of defense's own MedicalSchool our graduates go off to serve inthe armed forces for the United Statesand take care of our service members andtheir families throughout their careersgreat thank you very much Sean last butnot least ranja and Roy yep I'm I'm RonJohn Roy I'm the VP of strategy at adoreme we're a direct to Consumer intimateapparel company based in New York foundin 2011 and been a long time googleWorks based customergreat thanks thanks very much ranjan andI hope your voice will open a little bitchart if you need watersoum without further Ado let's maybe getstarted a little bit more so you mightbe asking why generative AI is importantand even AI in generalwe believe that General generative Aiand AI as a technology is one of thosetransformative Technologiessimilar to other Transformations we'veseen in our historysorry just let me get the right theright slide for you so it's technologysimilar to when we saw steam powerelectricity and information technologywe firmly believe that it's going tochange the way that we work and live ona day-to-day basisAI has been at the center of GoogleGoogle's Innovation for the past decadeand we will continue to invest in thespace to allow our customers to focustheir employees on high value tasks byautomating business processes and andassisting with with highly complex ortime-consuming sometimes difficult tasksto make individuals more productivethe Mia mere fact of increasingproductivity has a direct impact on thebottom lineand can result in more revenue from anorganizationwhile this might sound very high levelfor you I what I've found is that whenwe start talking about theseTechnologies we need to start with youas the customer and understand a bitmore about your business processes andwhere we can help you be more productivewhether it's in a call centerunderstanding is there a way we can helpa call center agent take on more callsand respond to an email in a better wayor providing a sales rep with an easierway to proofread proposals and not spendso much time on grammatical errors butmore focus on the contentwhen we start talking about duet AI myown Journey started about 18 months agowhen I when I first started learningabout how this technology can reallyhelp me be more productiveI'll admits in the beginning it was abit of a habit-forming area where I hadto start using the functions as opposedto ignoring them but once I started Iquickly learned that there was huge timesaving for me as a person by byrecording meeting minutes and actionitems without having to actuallyphysically do the typing myself as wellas editing and reviewing documents thisreally I've really seen some timesavings around thatsimilar to my experiences we have overthe past months been collaborating withour customers and end users to developand taste various features in this spaceto help improve productivity some ofthese areas include helping you writeand build sharper and more usefuldocumentshelping you organize and act on datahelping you visualize with artistic withartistic vision from a simple prompthelping you connect through better callsand enhanced video audio and custombackgroundsand even and this is my personalfavorite creating business applicationsusing simple language with the likes ofapp sheetyou may be asking about how we adhere toour AI principlesduet was was built strictly in strictadherence to our air to the Google'sprinciple for responsible Ai and throughour works workspace Labs initiative wetested dueteri features extensively withhundreds of thousands of users wholeverage these tools to help them getthings donewe are here today to hear from some ofthese customers about their journey andwhat they've learned through thatprocessso without further Ado it's now time tohear from our panelistsgentlemenI've had feedback from many customersthey're unsure of where to start andwhat use cases apply the mostI'd like to ask all of you to share whatwas your AI your aha moments and how didyou see the business impact for this I'dlike to start with random on this oneyepyep so for me I actually that timelineyou showed earlier is very interestingso 2015 to 2017 I actually ran a startupfocused on news personalization andsummarization is something we worked onactively and it was terrible and thenfast forward to 2021 starting to playwith the Transformer models that cameout realizing it was there it wasamazing it was and for me it really wasan exciting moment because I realizedthis can change everything especially assomeone who focuses on content marketingbranding so the way we started rollingthis out in the company is with smallertask forces and this is before gettingaccess to duet Ai and really startingwith what's the worst part of your jobso for example a copywriter on our teamwe launch 80 to 100 new products a monththey have to write 100 productdescriptions every month and try to actoriginal and cool and fun for everysingle description and it's soul suckingand it's terrible and we literally startwith this is the worst part of your jobso if we can augment to that for you ifwe can automate that for you it's such abetter way to be have this technologyreceived by your teams but for me thevery cool part about duet AI is wealready live in Google workspaceproducts slide decks docs sheets that'swhere we are already so what startedfirst is kind of like small little taskforces and groups within marketingwithin engineering now we are able toroll out generative AI to the entirecompany where people are where peoplealready are so having helped me rightdirectly in your dock rather than havingto go out to some external tool knowingit's secure knowing it's going to be ayou know knowing starting to learn howto prompt as well these are things thatnow the entire company is able to learnI love that when we engageengagements on their workspace Journeywe always talk about the changemanagement element on what's in it forme and I like that part is what sucksmost about your job and how could weautomate it I think that's reallypowerfulhow about the knot what are some of yourexperiences well so similar similar kindof background but maybe to take it to amore personal uh level I've also beenworking kind of as a product person inand around AIML working with datascience for a long timeand you know I kind of thought I I knewwhat was going on and when these modelsfirst came out about a year ago I wasreally blown away right I just kind ofthought of them as thesesequential guests the next best wordtypes of things and and just seeing thatsomewhat simplistic technology get tothis point where it can do all theseamazing things like past the bar exam orwhatever like really blew my mind for methe personal aha momentit actually came outside of a workcontext so I was doing homework with mydaughter and her assignment was to comeup with an alternate ending to waitingfor a Godot which is this like absurdistplay that kind of is open-ended and wetalked about it probably for about ahalf hour and and came up with a bunchof ideas and then in 30 seconds puttingthat same question into like an llm itjust kind of just blew our minds that itwas pretty darn good right it kind ofcame up with a lot ofgood ideas and some better than what wecould come up with and for me thatreally again is someone who thought thatthey knew what was going on in the spacereally kind of opened me up to justreally thinking about okay waitI'm thinking about this too narrowly inmy day job I need to just like reallyopen it up and think where does thisreally fit in our product and kind ofhow we think about internal efficiencyand so just on a personal aha momentlevel that's really for me the themoment great thank youSean slightly out not necessarily in theconsumer business but more in themedical fact how what was your ahamoment so like the gentleman we've beendabbling in AI for quite a while nowactually in partnership with some greatcompanies like Google who have workedwith us along the way but those were alldeveloping clinical decision supporttools or diagnostic aids for Physiciansthey focused on an individual diagnosisa particular disease problem theyweren't generalized they weren'tsomething that everyone could use intheir everyday and so it was for us andfor our leadership when we showed themthat they could use these capabilitiesin a general manner in the workspacethat they were already in that theystarted to really embrace theopportunities and so during the trialtest trusted tester period wedeliberately Federated this out into alot of different use cases in theorganization station sort of broadeningthat aperture as Zohar was sayingbecause we weren't sure what everyonewas going to succeed with were thestudents going to want to use it for apersonalized tutoring on a topic theywere struggling with did the Deans wantto write policies on academic Integrityaround generative AI maybe in what otheruse cases could we find where we couldcapitalize on this in order to not somuch displace people or work but makethem more efficient we work ingovernment and in government we are sooften behind in our work we we areresource constrained and so if we canmake people more efficient they feelless overwhelmed they're more empoweredto to really produce for the governmentand for the peoplegreat thank you veryastronaut and when I started off thequestions I said customers are freeoften struggling with use cases or whereto start can you maybe Shane we'll startwith you Sean what are some of those usecases I know you shared some now buthow did you go about identifying themand what were some of the use cases thatare really helping your business rightnow or you for us the university yeahsorry for us it was key that it'd beorganic with our users right and Ron Jonwas talking about this where you had tofind something which is passionate tothem but we have a lot of different usecases within our organization rightyou've got research going on educationAdministration people who are buyingthings managing the finances Etc and sowe wanted to put it in their hands andlet them tell us what their use casesfor all of this were before it wasannounced yesterday we didn't have EarlyAccess to this we had folks who weretaking transcripts that were generatedbyother online video platforms and usinguh Bard or I'm sorry duet AI now tosummarize the meeting notes and gettingthose out to staff more quickly thanthey could have possibly manually wehave folks who are writing their ownpolicies internally I'm notorious forgetting stuck at the blank page when Ineed to formulate a new policy for theteam but I can edit it all day long soeven if the the AI doesn't understandall the nuances of DOD regulation yet Ican just have it write the Baseline andI'll fill in the the details I'll makethe corrections laterso this is not one of our agreedquestions so you can tell me but wasthere anything specific around thegenerations did you see like when yougave it out to the Departments I'massuming you've got different ages I wasreading an article yesterday that saidJane AIthat gen z's are are more likely toadopt AI is that true in your experienceor did you see something differentstatistically if we looked at it thereprobably was a bit of a difference inour experience it had more to do withthe personality of the individual rightand we're dealing with a small samplesize there are only so many seats thatwe could give outEtc but we saw a lot of innovation atall ages of our employees in fact it wasa digital immigrant who is telling methat one time when they were justgetting absolutely frustrated withmanually editing a policy they decidedto ask duet to just translate it into aDr Seuss rhyme for them at which pointit relieved the tension and theneveryone kind of got off of not theblank page but got off of thefrustration of it and were able toregroup and actually complete thedocument awesome thanks I'm really gladto see this is not a generational andonly a gen Z kind of technology soanyone can adopt it in the org ranjanhow about your organization what whatare some of the things you're seeingfrom a door me in terms of use cases youdid touch on product descriptions andthings but what else yeah the the way wekind of break everything down is therethings that save time so productdescriptions again in the past 30 to 40hours a month now down to one hour butthen there's entire new use cases thatyou could never have done before sowe're working on kind of like uh notesfrom a stylist that would beauto-generated based on customer databased on things that you had looked onat the past things that you like thiscolor you like this the other specialoccasion coming and being able togenerate a personalized note for everycustomer for every product so these arethe really exciting things that wouldnever would have been possible with justregular copywriters without AI so we'rereally trying to break things into thosetwo categories and think about where areyou going to save time and what can youcreate that you can never could havebeforefantastic thank you when we spokeearlier so on uh so are you you spokeabout also looking internal and how areyou going to change products for yourcustomers would you mind sharing some ofthose use casesyeah so maybe focusing on the internalstuff for usum I mentioned before the codingcompanion stuff like that that's a hugepiece so my team is the team that buildsour apps our services and so if you evenif you don't code check out videos onYouTube but it really is an amazingtechnology for people who build softwareit's like having a junior developersitting next to you and doing all thestuff you don't want to do and and youcan focus on the fun stuff that's been ahuge Focus for us getting good at thatgetting fast at that rolling that outacross the orga piece of that isn't just codingsoftware it's really the data analyticsand insight so writing SQL or just likequerying data and then we have a bunchof use cases that I would say are sortof like generative people who work inour organization and create stuff so yesit is customer service like we'retalking about but it's also editorialcontent marketing content it's obviouslya huge help there and then like for meI've really just been blown away by justthe day-to-day kind of stuff that youlike the example I was using before thatthat inspired me but getting this intopeople's hands when they're thinking ofmeeting agendas or summarizing notes orrewriting documentation and this iswhere I really like kind of where Googlefits into the space it's we're also veryheavy users of the entire suite and sohaving it right there an integrated isgreat because for us we think one of thebig challenges is just getting adoptionand just getting people excited to usethis thing because we already all haveour day we have our cockpit we have waysof doing things and we're going tointroduce this new thing if you thinkaboutum for folks who maybe are my age likepre-google search times like we all havespent a decade or more getting reallygood at searching and we're not reallygood at that and there's maybe like agen AI equivalent and we're at theearlier stages of that ramp up and it'sgreat to have Google integrated in therebecause it makes it easier for thoseday-to-day use casesgreat thank you very much zorhamso how if we change gears a little bitand and maybe think about the short andthe long term perspective of your orghow are you how are your organizationsthinking about your artificialintelligence and generative AI strategyum in terms of like short and and longterm uh ranjan if we can start with youyeah so in the short term one of thethings that we've seen that's one of thethe most exciting parts for me is so wehave offices we're based in New Yorkalso in Paris and Bucharest our maintechnology department is out ofBucharest our cto's Romanian we weredistributed essentially since ourfounding is now people communicate somuch more from the tech side the ideasthat they have now they're able toexpress themselves on LinkedIninternally so the amount of contentbeing created and knowledge being sharedout of our technology department we'vealready seen rise on almostexponentially and to me that idea oflike leveling the playing field withsharing knowledge with people being ableto express themselves means so much forthe future of our organization uh evenin terms of the demos that they showedyesterday one thing I'm very excitedabout is uh we live in slides we were uhwe're founded by ex McKinsey folks Idon't love slides per se but that'severything is a deck and uh so we haveto be able to create them and somepeople especially ex-consultants arekind of trained to make decks perfectlyand instantly and think like thatalready seeing that being able to reusetemplates import Knowledge from docs andsheets into a deck and have it generatethat for you it puts everyone on thesame playing field for how theycommunicate about business and strategyso to me that's one of the most excitingthings great thank you very much zohawhat about the knotso I think um maybe about six months agoevery company in the world was asked bytheir board or someone gen AI ishappening what what are you doing aboutit what's your strategy what's yourapproachso we thought a lot about this and we wesort of divided the problem up and thisis not an expert perspective right we'renot like a gen AI company this is us asa regular company thinking what doesthis mean for us we divided things intothree buckets we kind of said what doesthis mean for the products that we buildand how we serve our customer how shouldthis change our strategy looking alittle bit more steady state like whenthis stuff is more fully adopted andthen internally what does it mean forefficiency and so for us on the productside again being a wedding company andreally a two-sided Marketplace uh thereare a bunch of obvious places we startedlooking conversational interfaces make alot of sense for us people typicallyonly use us once for their wedding andthey don't want to get good at thisstuff they just kind of want to plantheir wedding and so learning a complexUI they just don't have a lot ofattention span for that so conversationmakes sense we also try to stringtogether a lot of unstructured datacontent articles and some structureddata so these llms are really good forthat we also have generative kind ofcontent building people writinginvitations to their guests or differentcontent communicating with vendors wherethis can be helpful so we kind of put abunch of stuff in this product bucketthen as we thought about the strategy wereally tried to kind ofpre-mortem the future and think in a fewyears when this is something we're allusing and like I said before we're kindof better at what does that mean for usand the tldr there is something like wethink unique content unique inventoryunique transactions those things thatmake you special as a company areprobably going to be more important andsome of the top of funnel Discovery UIInnovation might become less importantas the interfaces become smarter andsmarter in a sense so we spent some timethinking strategically should we berejiggering things as we think about thefuture and then internally we've touchedon a lot of it butum it's really looking at all those usecases how do we get customer servicemore efficient how do we think about thegenerative stuff that we're doing againcoding software development is a hugepiece of that data analytics is a hugepiece of that and that's probably wherewe're and a lot of companies are kind offurthest aheadgreat thank you very much Sean yeah soI'm actually going to kind of steal fromboth gentlemen here in terms of our ournear-term plans on this right soimmediately we want to recapitalize onwhat generative AI can do to take themost painful parts of people's days outof it or at least the most repetitioustime costly things which they do in intheir work so that we can be moreeffective with that but then I I alsovery much empathize with I agree withzohar's observation about this kind ofbeing like early days of search rightand learning how to search inparentheses and ands and ORS and all ofthat weird stuff that we all used tohave to do if you wanted to find a veryspecific result on the internet andherein it's about teaching the nextgeneration of medical providers how tointeract with generative AI because 10years from now the semantics areabsolutely going to be different but thecapabilities and no doing what theplatforms what the tools are capable ofis absolutely going to be critical if wewant to be delivering modern medicinemodern digital medicine to AmericanService members and their families andthat's what we're focused on there morebroadly and I'm a nerd I'm gonna callmyself out I'm going to show it all toyou I think about JJ Abrams Star Trekmovie and I think about Spock as he'slearning God only knows what quantummechanics or something in that little AIdriven cubicle that he's learning in andI think where does that capability fitin the future of Education in the futureof medical education and how long willit be until you have that personal tutorthat takes the The Physician away fromteaching didactic materials and allowsthem to focus on teaching clinicalskills with a human being allows them toMentor the student rather than justcontinue to repeat the same thing thatthey found in a textbookgreat I think what was interesting thatboth Sean and Zohar mentioned it'sactually forced the organizations tostart thinking about the future and whattheir differentiators are going to be ascertain functions start becoming verycommoditized so it's something we shouldall be thinking about in our org we'vespoken a lot about the benefits whatabout the risks are there any thingsthat you're seeing in your organizationwhen you started proposing or discussingthis from a broad perspective that wereconcerns from a risk perspective Seanmaybe we'll start with you yeah so umobviously I'm the one up here who worksin the government and the governmentstarts with no on anything that involvesrisk from an I.T perspective right andI'm the ciso I know that better thanmost uhbut we had to look at it from a riskmanagement framework which is the waythat the U.S government approaches thisand the key is it's the risk managementframework it's not the risk avoidanceframework so we have to balance what isthe risk of employing a new technologythat we don't fully understand yetversus the risk of not adopting thistechnology and being part of thesolution here and when we found out thatthe way Google has implemented this andagain as a public servant I have to saythis is not an endorsement of Google butwhen we found out that Google was usingthe same common infrastructure the sameprivacy protections which we relied onfor everything else we do on workspaceand we could say this is just another AIdriven feature just another right AIdriven feature in the workspace platformthe same as spam filtration decisionsmeat transcripts Etc well then from acompliance standpoint it became veryeasy to say yes and vice that risk ofnot doing anything became a resoundingyesgreat thank you ranjan yeah for us Ilike that point Sean made what's therisk of not doing something versus therisk of actually pursuing this and forus we kind of made the decision inunderstanding that people are going tostart using this technology and the bestway to actually encourage it is toalready use it in a secure way in atrusted way where they already are andthat's why duet AI is so interesting tous because it's where they already areit's in their docks it's in slides andwe are long-time Google Cloud customersworkspace customers and just thatfeeling of security and Trust across theorganization with our CTO you know youdon't have to sell him on getting peopleto use this he already has a decade oftrust built into here so so for uspeople are going to use this technologyanyway so it might as well be in atrusted wayand I think that's an important conceptfor many customers out there ispeople will use it anyway so let'sprovide the tools internally versusallowingto go out there in tools that you don'tmanagezoha what about when you went to theboard and had this discussion well notmuch to add on that stuff I would say uhkeep your general counsel your BFF likeeverything went by legal with us and itwas super helpful product Council alsoshout out thereum but really I think initially it feltvery wild west and kind of scary and Iknow a lot of companies discussions youwere having with like sister companiesand stuffum Developers for example were justgoing out there and using the consumertools as opposed to like going throughthe Enterprise just because asdevelopers we all want to be faster andplay with with the shiny stuff but thesedays I feel like the platforms arereally catching up and and my personalbelief is you knowpretty soonhowever you need it locked down you'llbe able to get that locked down that wayso we hope that that was kind of atemporary status just like otherTechnologies like communicationFrameworks and things like that and thatwe get to a place where really the levelof security is there if you need itthank you very much I hope you got whatyou wanted out of the decision lookingforward to the rest of the day with youthank you have a great evening[Music]thank you"
