supply chainor Logistics capabilitieswe 2023 has been the year of data and AII had a very exciting year exciting yearfor my team our fieldand I think that's no better place thanin downtown San Francisco at the Googleconference to meet with people andexchange ideasI'm almost losing my voice just fromlike 48 Hours of conversations and uhhas been super exciting so I'm excitedto stand here today to announce our dataand AI Cloud for supply chain yesterdaymy team and I got to announce the dataand the iCloud for marketing so um we'reexcited to bring these to you and ourcustomers our partners and work with youon themmy name is Lucas tidalson I'm the headof productfor data and AI Cloud here at GoogleI'll be joined on stage by John oursolution lead will walk us through thespotlight solutions that we have instore for you and then Neil will come onstage he's uh the CEO and founder ofgeotab a really exciting customer ofours who has done incredible things inthe supply chain space now for yearsreally making our supply chains moresustainablewhich is one of the reasons I'm soexcited to be heredata and AI can be used anywhere toreduce costs increase efficienciescontribute to the bottom line right yourprofit margin your Revenuebut in the supply chain it does all thatand it helps our planet we reduce carbonemissions we reduce waste things thatwould be otherwise thrown outand that makes it a very exciting thingto announce here todaywe will go through really quick on thelearnings we had over the last coupleyearsthen we'll go into the solutions we'requeuing up for you the learnings we hadand how we can bring that back toprospects and customersso the global supply chain has beenhumming in the background for yearswithout much attention from mainstreambut then you know Canal gets stuck uhthe ship gets stuck in the canalum and we all know about it there'sflooding there's there's a there arehurricanes the natural disasters thatcause disruptions and the cascadingcascading effects of that are tremendousand we feel it or we just talk brieflyabout the covet crisis right and all ofa sudden toilet paper is out of stockand people pay attention to thatit's very realI had the I had the fortune to work tolead our Consulting arm here at Googlefor data and Ai and with that we we gotto work with customers firsthand tofigure out how can we get covet vaccinesto people and the ingredients for thevaccines to the right to the right planto the right location so these can bebuilt quickly can be manufacturedquickly and get out therebut it wasn't just covet vaccines rightthere was also local restaurants we havea couple here todayrestaurants that had to change to Localrestrictions and so they had to changetheir ordering process what they neededin the stores and whenand doing it correctly and being able toforecast accurately made a hugedifference some of these restaurantscompared to their peers were able to togain tremendous amount of Revenue sharein that time because they were preparedthey had planned for itwe worked with uh I see some familiarfaces here we worked with one of thelargest grocery stores and were able toaccurately forecast where fresh produceneeds to be whenso this is like you know this is theseare products that are that are farmedthat are that are brought across oceansto us and now they're in the store butthey were in the wrong place at thewrong time and millions of dollars worthof producers thrown out because it's notbeing it's not needed it wasinaccurately forecastand so the savings to the company andthe benefits to our environment aretremendous if we can use AI for thatof course now in the last in the lastcouple years I've not heard this manyTech CEOs talk about like miningoperations and all these things thatpreviously we didn't really talk aboutlike that level of transparency thelevel of understanding of what all flowsinto all supply chain has really changednow this wouldn't be a talk about dataif I didn't bring in some data pointsherein 2021 the average company in thedeveloped worldlost 184 million dollars on supply chainissues so things were not in the rightplace at the right timeand I would love to say that 2021 was aparticularly bad yearbut I don't think that it will change Ithink there will be more disruptions inthe future we are interconnected we arewe are hyper efficient right we don'tkeep large amounts of inventory on handwe want we want to have a streamlinedsupply chain and so we need to be readyfor these disruptionsand the only way we can do that is bytechnology that is able to take intoaccount last minute changes that is ableto change predictions and get them tothe people that need them right thennow 88 what is that 83 of participant inthe supply chainuh immediately pointing fingers righteverybody is pointing to their vendorand that vendor is pointing to the nextvendor and whatnot so everybody wants abetter experience in the supply chainthat is likeeverybody can agree on thatand then the CEOs of these companies 48and are saying that sustainability iscan be is one of the top prioritieswhich is up substantially from previousyearsnow then another topic that I hear a lottalking with customers is around safedata sharingyou guys probably have been already atsome of the sessions we have reallydoubled down on data sharing analyticsHub data clean roomright now we have 350 petabytes per weekthat is being shared and supply chain isa huge component of that like people inthe supply chain being able to sharewith their Partners in a secure waywhere they can keep control of the datathey can keep control of who has accessto it but they can share it to thepeople that need it and are supposed tohave access to it that is up 40 fromlast year so anything that is up 40 fromlast year I I'm paying very closeattention tonow the next big thing this is not thisis no shocking Slide the next big thingis AI now we put already AI it just Iwould say traditional AIum traditional AI in almost everythingwe do right forecasting anomalydetection being able to see what ishappening why it's happening alertingpeople about itthe thing that gets me very excitedabout large language models in thesupply chain is accessibility sopreviously data has been only accessibleto people that are in front of acomputer that are looking atspreadsheets and dashboards and they'reused to reading them and understandingwhat that meanswith large language models we can nowbring that insight to the more likeaverage person participating in thesupply chain so now we can bringinsights we can bring predictions we canhave conversations through LMS withthose people to give recommendations onwhat we should be doing in the supplychainso that's on the on the accessibilityside which I'm super excited about theother side that is very exciting in thesupply chainis that a lot of the supply chain stilloperateswith sticky notes like I had a largemulti-billion dollar companyum my team and I got to work with wherethe vast majority of information wasstill on sticky notes so what we did iswe you know you snapped a picture we ranit through document AI uh got understoodwhat was on the sticky note and then youcan process it through a large languagemodel to actually make it accessible forthe for your for your ecosystem ofAnalyticsand that opens up so much moreinformation that your previous evenpreviously were not able to getso the combination of accessibilityand then also adding unstructured datathat's called sticky notes unstructureddata into this into this informationchain I think is incredibly valuableand with that I'm very excited toannounce data and AI Cloud for supplychain we're bringing together our ourkey products right we have Luca we havebigquery we have vertex Ai and a varietyof other productswith accelerators so so these learningsthat we had from the fields thesetemplates were making them accessibleeasily accessible the data sources thedata enrichments through analytics Hubthrough providers like geotabright making the state making enrichingyour own data with other dataand then our Partnerships we'll talkabout that at the end it's like ourextensive partnership ecosystemand solutions Spotlight solutions thatare easy to deployso this is not like we want to make itvery easy for you to get from time tovaluethere has been a lot of thinking goinginto it we we know what the challengesare that you're facing and so we we puta couple here together a coupleSpotlight solutions that John will talkabout in a minute I already talked aboutdata sharing but we're going to talkabout forecasting demand sensing we'regoing to talk about sustainable impactof sourcingand with that I'm handing it over toJohn who's going to walk us through itin depththank you Lucasand thanks all as Lucas said for yourtime and attention this morning on the 9A.M Thursday slotOkay soI'm here to talk about a few solutionsthat we want to Spotlight as part of thedata Cloud announcement for supply chainthere's quite a lot to cover so I'mgoing to do a bit of a rapid firethrough these Solutions obviously we'llbe sharing a lot more detail on thewebsite we can talk afterwards in the Qa etc as wellall of the solutions I'm going toSpotlight are either part of orintegrate with something we call thecortex frameworkand so it makes sense to start therewith what is the cortex framework andwhy have we built itand in a word it's about accelerationit's about accelerating and making iteasier for you to take your data Journeywhere you get your data onto the cloudand are able to make use of that data ina business contextmore specifically it means that we'veworked at a data source level at thebottom of the slide herewith a number of very common datasources in the supply chain space in theErp space sap of course we've workedwith Salesforce we've worked with otherpartners as you can see in the slidehereand we've also worked with dataintegration partners and with our owntooling to make it easy to get that dataonto bigquery in a cortex frameworkcompatible wayso this means a bit of data cleansing itmeans CDC processing of that data and weprovide that tooling and thoseprocessing scripts as part of our dataFoundation within the cortex frameworkyou can see that here in the middle ofthe slide on top of that we also providea lot of data modelsand these data models contextualize thebusiness data to make it much easier foryou to make use of itbut we go a step further than that so ontop of that what we've done is over thelast two or so years of the frameworkbeing available we have iterated on itto the point of getting to a level offunctional maturity where we've groupedaccelerators into business areas andwhat you're seeing on the slide here iswhat we've got in the supply chain spaceso some of this is part of thatframework and I'm going to take youthrough some of what we're announcingnew todaybut these are all sets of dashboards andaccelerators that are all available aspart of the frameworkand then we've also worked with solutionPartners so I mentioned we worked withdata integration Partners but we've alsoworked with solution partners withcommercial solutions that specialize insome of these same supply chain areas tohave them integrate with our datafoundation and with the cortex frameworkand crucially because what thisrepresents isand essentially an Enterprise dataFoundation it's completely open and byopen I mean it's open source so this isall available today on GitHub under theApache 2 licenseso that's the frameworklet's jump into a few of those solutionsthat I talked about spotlightingfirst off demand sensingso we've heard from customers that likeLucas said traditional demandforecasting Solutions have been runninginto their limitations more and moreover the last few years Lucas talkedabout the covert example but morerecently of course we've had some severeinflationary times and other supplychain shocks that have meant there's alot of volatility in supply chain thattraditional forecasting Solutions can'tmeet based on historical sales Trenddata Etcbut that accurate forecast is of coursecritical to making sure you avoid thingslike stockouts over stock situations youavoid creating negative customersentiment and naturally as a result ofthat that you look to maximizeprofitability and reduce costand so demand sensing is a solutionaccelerator built with the cortexframework that looks to help with thisby merging multiple data sources anddata signals that give a more holisticrepresentation of real-world demand sothat you get a more accurate demandforecast that responds better to thereal world as it is now and shocks thatmight comeand we do that by blending thathistorical sales data through a sap Erpsystemthrough your demand plan with an ibpsystem or some whatever demand planningtool you useand additional data that helps representthat real world so some of the data setsthat we've included with the solutionaccelerator itself are whether GoogleTrends as you can see here and what youcan do as a result is you can actuallystart to react to upcoming situationsand that's where this becomes demandsensing not just forecasting it'ssensing potential issues in your supplychain and part of the solutionaccelerator is also alertingfunctionality to let you knowproactively that there's an issue orthat there's some kind of out of boundsa demand signal that's going to impactyour demand forecast to let you knowit's time to go update your forecast andreact better to the real world as it isso that's demand sensingwhat we've also done as I said is we'veworked with Partners Solutions providerslike Pluto 7 C3 Ai and what I'mdelighted to announce today here onstage is the latest integration we havewith deloitte's converged consumerso this is a solution it's actually awhole umbrella Suite of solutions fromDeloitte we've decided to focus on twofor the initial integration we'reannouncing demand forecasting and priceoptimizationand we've done that because looking atthe world as it is today I mentionedinflationary times but in generalcustomers are also a lot more costsensitive as a result at the momentprice optimization looked like thelogical place to start it's also asolution that provides very tangiblevery immediate benefits when usedif we look at these in just a bit moredetail so demand forecasting it is whatit says on the tin right it provides avery accurate demand forecast for yoursolutions for your products excuse meandwhat's key about it though is that it'salso explainable which means that whenyou get this forecast you can actuallyunderstand not just the forecast and theimpact it has but how the forecast cameto be and what were the signals thatdrove the forecast to be the way it isand then on top of that demandforecasting price optimization is builtto support your pricing recommendationsand so what this allows you to doisprovide recommendations for yourproducts your optimal product pricingstrategy in a retail setting so that youcan maximize either marginvolume or whatever balance you you wantto achieve and it simplifies that wholeprocess and that whole pricing decisionprocessand we're delighted as I say to launchthis to Market with integration as youcan see now powered by the cortexframework so we've worked with Deloitteover the course of 2023 on this andthese are just the first two pieces ofthe overall converge consumer Suite ofsolutions that we're launching initiallyuh we are continuing to work withDeloitte as part of an expandedpartnership that's you'll also hear moreabout here at next and at the Lloyd'sBooth of course downstairsuh so we're excited to see our customersdo with this and how they make use of itand that is converge consumernext upsustainable supplier recommendationsothis is a Brand New Concept example thatwe're also showing for the first timetoday and this is also built using thecortex frameworkessentiallywhat we wanted to achieve with thisconcept is toillustrate how organizations can embedsustainability into their sourcing andinto their core operational day-to-dayworkflowsto do that we've combined supplierperformance datafrom traditional back-end Erp systemsand from third-party partner providersas you can see hereto provide a set of dashboards theintent of which is to assess yoursuppliers more holistically acrosstraditional performance metrics but alsoacross broader ESG and sustainabilitymetrics and in doing so help you to meetregulatory standards both current andupcomingwe've also as part of this so we'veproduced the dashboards and acceleratorsthat I talked about being part of thetypical cortex framework layout on aprevious slidebut we've also wanted to build agenerative AI interface to help younavigate this and to give you proactiverecommendations so give you an actualanswer about your suppliersand what you what to do for a givenSupply situation or given sourcingsituationand what was interesting was as we builtthis we found that it actually while itdid this it also helped navigate thosedashboards so to build all of this andto give a even a reasonable level ofdepth into all of the differentsustainable learning metrics that thesesuppliers could haveit naturally ended up resulting in quitea lot of dashboards and so what wasinteresting was to see the side effectwhere the Gen III interface actuallyhelps you navigate through thosedashboards and filter right down to notjust the right dashboard but with theright set of filters for the context ofyour questionand of coursewe couldn't go through a overview of allof these Solutions about giving at leastone demo in the interest of time hereand also because it's quite scary andI've pre-recorded this uh but I'm happyto go through afterwards in more detailwith anyone who's interested as well uhthe demo that I want to show you herenow on sustainable supplierrecommendationjust before I click playyou may recognize the user interfacethis is very similar to what you'll haveseen over this week with duet and alsowith bardon the bottom right here and on theright hand pane in general we have ourconversational interface this is whereyou ask your questions and you get theanswers this is also where you'll seethe dashboards get loaded that arecontextual to the question you've askedand on the left you see the conversationhistory so you can retain context youcan jump back through differentconversations and questions you've askedthe demo I've prepared is based on asample cpg company and this is achocolate manufacturerand they're interested in this Con inthis scenario in how they can maintainand check supplies for all of theirongoing inventory to make sure they cancontinue making chocolate prettystraightforwardso what's the first thing you'd want todo wellyou're going to want to check what rawmaterials do I need to reorder in otherwordswhere are they nearing the needs reorderso we are appoint less than 30 days andyou can see cacao beans here is the onethat needs most recent reorder and youcan see some of the dashboards that arebrought up to support that context dataSupply top materials you can also seehow you could jump off into moredetailed dashboards if you want but fornow we're going to zero in on okay welllet's look at lead time very traditionalmetric and if we look at lead time basedon the top suppliers for cacao beans wefind National Supply is the lowest leadtime it also means as a result you cansee that it has the highestreplenishment time because you've gotmore time to play with to reorderbecause they're the fastest and thelowest lead timeokay so that's lead time spend isanother traditional key metric so whatare the top three suppliers based ontotal spend and average purchase priceand so you can see here again NationalSupply they're Midway in terms of howmuch we spend on them but they'resignificantly lower in terms of purchaseprice and so nowthey're looking like a supplier that wewould really like to do more businesswith and save costswhat about the sustainability impactso let's ask which is my suppliers havethe highest emissions for transportationand when we do thiswe find our snag National Supply may bethe cheapest and the fastest but thereare also the ones with the highestemissionsand this is significantly higher thanthe highest emissions for thealternative suppliers here you can alsosee again how you can jump into therelevant dashboards to get more detailson Transportation routes on thesustainable sourcingbut what we want to do is understandwell why are there emissions so muchhigher because I mean they're cheaperthey're faster is there a way we canstill work with themso the answer is pretty straightforwardthe emissions are high because thetransportation mode is air and air is ofcourse Very significantly more carbonintensive as a transportation methodthan Road shipping Etcand when we ask that we again get aseries of dashboards that give us morecontext and more detail on theirsustainability impact everything fromESG scores to Transportation mode totheir emissions Trend you can see theorder detail breakdown if you want toget really granular with it and you canalso see things like sentiment score andtheir news feed and you'll notice in thenews feed that you may not if you're atthe back of the room that there's a lotof Articles here on deforestation impactas far as National Supply are concernedsothat's an additional source of concernwhat is the deforestation history ofnational Supplyand this is super interesting becausefor those of you who aren't aware thereare prospective legislation underwayright now in the EU that willForce suppliers to ensure nodeforestation impact from the rawmaterials behind their supplies that'sfor certain types of goods and thatincludes chocolate and cacao beans andyou can see here how the relevantdashboards we can bring up actually letyou zoom right in not just to thecountry but to the farm or Plantationwhere those are actually produced andthen get the deforestation impact rightdown to a farm levelfor each of the supporting farms forthat supplierand so as a result you get enough detailto be able to understand can I work withthe supplier can we work on a way to gettheir their emissions impact down arethere deforestation history going toresult in any kind of regulatory issueswith upcoming legislation maybe if wecan get them to shift to Road orshipping it's going to mean their leadtime won't be so great anymore butconversely those are usually cheaperforms of transportation so their averageprice might come down even further andyou can still work with that supplierso that sustainable supplierrecommendation this is the concept butwe are working not just on having builtthis but on incorporating sustainablesourcing into the cortex framework aspart of our GitHub releases so we'd loveyour feedback and to understand whereyou see the most prioritization there orwhat are the key features of that youreally want to see more of all of thisis work in progress for us right nowand then last but not least I wanted tobriefly talk aboutanother solution that we've built thatis an integration of an existing inpreview AI service from Google calledshelf checking AI this was announcedearlier this year with the cortexframeworkand this is a solution squarely in theretail space for supply chainthe idea is that well first of all withshell checking AI imagine you're aretail store operator and you want tooptimize your shelf storage forcustomers so you want to make sure thatwhen a customer comes in they see nicefull shells but you also want to trackwhich shelves are getting empty to makesure that you're ordering on time andthat you're minimizing again the sameold factors stock out and overstockingand so shelf checking AI was part of asuite of AI tools released earlier thisyear by Googlethat are aimed at retail shelf checkingAI is a way of visually matching what'son the Shelf with the product ID andproduct attributes so that you can thentie it to your back-end systems andensure that you'vestopped yourselves correctlybut what if you could integrate thiswith the data foundation and the cortexframework as a whole and you couldcombine your sap product data yourhistorical sales data your point of saledataand job checking AI you could have anend-to-end solutionand that could give you a 360 degreeview that would help you automate andbuild on the downstream impact of whatyou're seeing on those shelvesnot just what you're seeing on theshelves but what you're getting fromthat point of sale data as well so youcould prioritize restocking of yourshelves based on your frequency youcould adjust based on margin of yourproducts to make sure that you'regetting the optimal uh the optimal salesof the right products at the rightmarginyou could analyze the health of yourshelves overall your consumptionpatterns you can build off thoseconsumption patterns to then influenceyour other systems and potentially eventhough this isn't part of the solutionagain you're forecastingand so you can build on the combinationof all of that data to identify tobetter identify that on hand stock youcan look at your Warehouse stock at thethe data in your back-end SAP systems sothat you can again optimize what you'reputting on yourselves when you'reputting it there optimize for a marginandoverall end up with increased uh storeassociate productivityincreased sales lower stock upand ultimately that are profitabilityand that's the last of the solutions Iwanted to take you through thanks forthe time I'll pass back now to Lucas andNeil to hear more about geotabthank youthank you so much[Applause]it's always great to see the theory thenput into reality right I love seeingthose demos that's awesomeokay now let's talk about geotab youguys are oh this is Neil so uh he was onthe side earlier thank you for joiningme here todayum great great customer of Google cloudandum why don't we start off with with whatis geotab right it's awesome thank youso hi everybody Neil causeum thanks for having me here todaycongratulations Lucas on theannouncements I think this is a reallyinteresting uh it's interesting for ourcustomers being in the supply chainindustry so I'm going to run you througha little bit about geotab what we'reaboutum you know a big Google customer we'vebeen partners with Google for a verylong time so geotab is a company we wereabout 2 000 employees we started aroundtwo thousand we are the largesttelematics company in the worldwe have nearly 4 million vehicles thatwe connectso you know what is vehicle telematicsvery important when it comes to supplychain we're really kind of the engine atthe bottom that collects the data aboutthe vehicle about how the vehicle isbeing used uh information off the enginebus everything about windscreen wipersare on that's been involved in anaccident faults in the vehicle formaintenance safety information and weconnect that to the cloud and then webring that into analytics to allowcustomers to run better fleets andmanage their supply chain monitorunderstand what's happening kind of havea philosophy a geotab you cannot managewhat you don't measureum so you know some of our customersthat are interesting the whole of NewYork City 39 000 Vehicles connected uhthe city runs on that so that's all theemergency vehicles it's all the buses uhanything involved in public service thewhole state of Californiaum is sole source geotherm from atelematics perspective so Caltrans allthe agencies U.S federal governmentsum you know many of the agencies in theU.S federal governmentum are all geotab and soum you know it's interesting just to seeyou know again that philosophy of youcan't manage which you don't measure youknow we're providing Source data thatdrives a lot of you know the platformsuh you know that Google needs andannounced here today so that's a littlebit aboutum you know Jill tab we are um as wementioned the platform I think everybodyis a platform these days but uh you knowfrom a telematics perspective we're agreat platform I wanted to show you thislittle dashboard sorry it's not aperfect picture but it's just aninteresting one this is from our officesin Oakville love to have Lucas over atsome pointum it's just interesting to see see allof that data is sourced and driven outof Google bigquery Everything Is liveall of the data you see thiscontinuously live that's our number ofconnected vehiclesum and so every day as you're walkingaround you watch these numbers andmetrics change so really data-drivencultureum at your time so that's a little bitabout your tip okay great Joe thank youso muchum that's that's impressive thank you sosowhat are some of the internal use casesyou guys have where you where you useour products like which ones are youexcited about and and how do they impactyour own operationso you know given that we're anengineering company and you know we havea very much a data science data-drivenculture we're a massive user you know ofGoogle resources and we worked with umthe Google team very much from theearliest days on leveraging Googlebigquery in fact you know the bigqueryteam has been amazing at um you knowlistening to geotab in the early daysyou know there wasn't a big GIS Focusfor example on Google bigquery and youknow they've added all the giscomponents which gives you the abilityto have you know data that is like youknow about geography so where are youum you know by state by area and thatmakes the debt even more powerful sointernally at your tab you know I thinkwe have you know 18 petabytes of datawhat's kind of cool is that every systemin our organization pushes their datainto bigquery we leverage a lot of thebigquery services like bqml so beingable to attach machine learning veryvery easily to this very large amount ofdata and to be able to do things likeanomaly detection to be able to analyzethe behavior of their data and then makeit instantly available in those in thosedashboards I mean we have more than 100data scientists and what's what's supercool to me is a bit of an engineeringnerd is you know the fact that you cango into you know bigquery and you cansit you can write a query and you cansay I want to see you know all thecharges that are currently charging inSpain or you know I want to go you knowwe just did a new release three weeksago did the number of customer callsincrease you know and and to me beingable to have those things instantlyaccessible you know by anybodydemocratizing the access to data in theorganization allowing anybody in anyDepartment to turn around and go youknow I would like to know X and it'sjust instantly accessible within acouple of minutes to me I think is superexciting so yeah we spend a lot of moneywith Google but it's absolutely you knowwell worth it in terms of the scale thatyou know that we need to operate out inthe services we need to offer ourcustomers yeah thank you you know Ithink that's that's super valid like theability to not have to move your dataright there's no egress there's noingresses it's there and you can accessthose AI functionalities like bigquerymachine learning right which I think isa it's a really good like first step forpeople to take on the AI Journey or yourdata is in bigquery you want to usethese and now vertex integration isright there so like being able to do itall without ever having to move yourdata so it makes your first party dataso much more valuable 100 and yeahproducts like vertex AI we're nowstarting to leverage you know at largescale as I mentioned bqml what's soexciting for us I mean you know wehonestly went through this journey inthe early days of deciding whether wewant to go with Google on the moreproprietary software side or go opensource and you know we as an engineeringcompany you know always like the idea ofOpen Source the best decision we evermade was not to do that and to go youknow with Google because what's soamazing is the building on top of itlike you know what we what we what whatyou know BQ is today and what verdictsis today you've got these amazingEngineers investing in the platform andboosting it up and so every month youcome to the next advancement which makesyour products better because you can nowleverage all of that in your companyyeah yeah now what I I know we have alot of joint customers here what aresome of the things that that we dotogether well that helps them yes sothere's so many things that we we do onthe side I'll choose maybe one exampleso Enterprise free Fleet Managementwhich is the largest leasing company inNorth Americaum we did an interesting one for themthat lines up with the sustainabilitytheme which I'll I'll mention and thatis that um they came to us and they saidwe'd like to just studyum with our customers and so what we didis we took all of theiruh travel data so how are you using yourvehicle where is the vehicle going whatis the temperature in the area where thevehicle's driving how long is it stayingin a particular location for and thenwhat we did is we used we called it EDSAit's really in a nutshell we analyze thebehavior of your vehicle and then we tryand recommend to you which of thevehicles are sensible to convert to EVsand which ones you shouldn't rightbecause not every use case there's justnot all the vehicle types out there sopicking the right vehicle for the rightjob becomes critically important so whatwe do is we break it down and we foundroughly 13 of the vehicles are the mostoptimal and what's what's really cool isif you know we even worked out the ROISo within a four year period switchingthose trucks to this vehicle or thatvehicle from different EV manufacturersyou would be able to get this amazingRoi say 33 million dollars over thatperiod and you know remove somethinglike 197 000 tons of carbon out of theatmosphere so you know what'sinteresting about doing this kind ofapproach is it's not just thesustainability angle it's also the costsaving like people think that the thetwo have to be mutually exclusive andwhat we found in this research was thatit's absolutely not and that's where youknow we're incentivizing customersshowing them the reason why they had tochange so that's one you know really Ithought was kind of an interestingexample of how it was used again allbuilt on the framework of bigquery andthe data science and vertex powering thestuff to make these decisions you needto leverage a lot of that AII mean and um just really short becauseI know we can talk about this foreverbut what are you excited for next uhyeah I mean he can't not talk about gnairight I mean you know that that's goingto come up but but I mean ultimately thekey thing for me is like you have tostart with collecting all the data rightand you know you you can't use gen AI onsomething that gen AI doesn't haveaccess to so the number one step is tosay you know I have telematics or I'musing these other services from from theGoogle supply chain platform once I havethe data available in bigquery or in ina data source now the Gen AI capabilitycan help you analyze that data at scalepick out these interesting you knowinsights make decisions and changes toyour organization and you know we knowthat wherever we are at GNR today in ayear two years three years time we'regoing to be even further ahead so I'mjust you know so excited to be able tobuild in your fleet manager is now goingto be built into the the mind the heartand soul of gen AI we're going to finetune the model so they are your expertfleet manager and I said what I need toknow today and it'll tell you focus onsafety focus on supply chain reliabilitydo some sustainability work and so it'sexciting times yeahyeah I think you have spot on there Ithink if we you know every there arethings everybody will do but then inorder to differentiate yourself yourfirst party data second and third partydata will really be the differentiatorand that's exciting yeah so getting thatFoundation right so if you wouldn't mindlike um thank you so much for coming onon stage thank you very much yeahumso yeah[Applause]we talked about the challenges in thesupply chain right the opportunities atthe same time and I'm I'm
