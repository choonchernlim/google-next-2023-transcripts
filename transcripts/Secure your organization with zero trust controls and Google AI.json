might be lateevening for some perhaps middle of thenight for some let's do a quick hands upexercise how many of you are from theEuropean region herequite a few what what about Asia Pacificall right we got a few and then theAmericas north or southcool so today in the next 45 minutes I'mgoing to walk you through the latestadvancements in the Google securityofferings specifically we'll focus onzero trust controls and AI controls thatwe intend to roll through the rest ofthis falla couple of housekeeping things we haveset aside about five to ten minutes forquestions towards the end so there's amic in the center please feel free tocome ask us questions or challenge anyof the assumptions that are out hereuh second uhthere is a way to sign up for all theseannouncements that we are making todayfor Early Access so don't leave the roombefore the end of the session uh thelink for sign up shows up at the endI also want to introducemy co-speaker uh for this segmentchess Grundy would be joining us in alittle bit to talk about his experienceson howUniversity of Notre Dame has utilizedsome of these capabilities for theirorganizationand if you didn't get my name I'm nikhilI'm responsible for the proud managementteam that builds all these securitytools bringing it to you our customersbefore I dive in I want to just recounta story from earlier this morningwhen I woke up I went out for a runwhich was more like a stroll but it wasessentially as I looked out of the ofthe bay I realized it's a beautifulmorning the sun was just coming upum the gorgeous pink and orange Hues ofSun's reflection were there in the oceanwater and it was really calm beautifulin Serenethen suddenly I heard a set of blaringalarms essentially Emergency Servicesrushing to help somebody down the downthe roadnow why do I recount this I couldn'thelp but relate toour world which is you know despite thefact that we may think that a lot ofthings are going well there's somebodyout there that is being attacked as wespeak there is someone out there thathas not realized that a data breach hashappened in their organizationand there's someone out there who'strying to deal with all the aftermath ofpotential breachesnow how does Google workspace help youin tackling some of these problemswhat is our design philosophy and ourapproach to go and make sure that youare not one of those that get impactedby the stats that you see on the on thescreenif you think about it we are reallyarchitected to make keeping all themodern threats in mindwe offer a cloud native zero trustinfrastructure as many of you are awareyour data is stored in the in the cloudwhat that means is we are able to verifyevery single access request andcontextualize it based on specificsignals these could be IPA addressesthese could be geolocation device healthand many others so having your data inthe cloud allows you to continuouslyverify who is accessing your data andhave controls that you need in order toprovide fine-grained accesssecond a lot of our threat defenses arepowered by AIand I often use this example when we tryto explain the core of AI that we haveif you are a Master Chef you have abunch of secret sauce and secret recipesthat's where our AI model and AI mlintelligence comes into playbut what makes a unique difference isthe ingredient that you add to your mixand for us that ingredient is data thedata points that we collect acrossbillions of devices billions of userswithin workspace apps or Beyond likeYouTube or Chrome helps us driveintelligence and be really clear aroundthe utilization of the AI models that weare we are implementinglastly we offer defense in depth you canleverage Google scale infrastructure areliable infrastructure something thatGoogle helps manage for workspace sothat you don't have to worry aboutpatching your on-premise systemsbut I could tell you about thearchitecture all day long we can spendthree days on it what does it truly meanwhat does it drive real world benefitsfor you and your organizationnow these are stats which are not fromGoogle these are all stats from thirdparties it is not an accident thatworkspace has zero known vulnerabilitiesin the last five years as compared tomany other Solutions or Legacy SolutionsI would say we are at a big zerosimilarly if you're using workspaceyou're dealing with 41 fewer incidentsas compared to other email providers soit should make your life easier when youhave to triage less and lastly if youthink about cyber insurance premiums asan indicator of cyber riskwhat we have found is customers usingworkspace are on are essentially payingup to 50 Less in premiums becauseworkspace is deemed to be safer thansome of the choices out therehow do we bring this to lifeif you the the core of all of this is tomake sure that we can provide you withbuilt-in capabilitiesplatformized in a way that you canleverage them across all the surfacesand by all surfaces I mean applicationslike Gmail calendar chat and even Beyondwith chrome so you would get similarlevels of protection on phishing malwarecontext aware access data security auditintelligence and a whole whole list ofthings in a consistent fashion acrossthe surfaces that we that we manage foryouit's all built on the basicprinciple of making sure that we canprovide you a safe infrastructure astrong infrastructure that Google canhelp that Google can help help you withso let's take a look at the benefitsthat this architecture truly providestoday most of us areworking in a hybrid mode and so we wantto make sure that Google workspace canprovide you with the requisite tools toenable productivity for your employeescontractors and end userswe also want to make sure that ourapproach can help you prevent threatsbefore they emergenow the last thing which workspace doeshelp you a whole lot is to make surethat you can stay compliant with yourwith your sovereignty goals there's aseparate session on that so today we'llbe covering the first two blocks andthen if you're interested please doattend the separate session as as welllet's go to the first one which is howdo we help you enable safer workand what good way to explain that than ademooh before I introduce the demo I have tointroduce you to the characters we havea new employee Megan who is interestedand has just joined your organization wealso have admin Amanda who helps makesure that you are organization stayssafelet's start with what Megan sees interms of her experience while usingworkspace and then we'll show you howadmin Amanda can adopt the built-in zerotrust controls to make sure that herorganization is protectedall rightthe three questions at the end so thisisMegan going in and creating a Google docfileshe creates a bunch of interestingcontent she's very productive but whatyou would realize very quickly is thatthis file gets labeled as restricted ontop that happened through Google's AInow the user also gets a choice toaccept that label if needed uh so thatwe can have a feedback loop to thesemachine learning and AI modelsnext if she tries to share this fileremember this has been deemed restrictedwith someone who is outside theorganization that is that will not beallowed and it's all baked into theGoogle Drive experience contextually forthe user to be educated and understandwhat is going onnow remember Megan is a new employee shehas to do another task she goes to heremail and naively decides to copy pastea set of social security numbers piiinformation into an email and send it toan unintended recipientthe important part is this email is notsent over because it's detected byGoogle's DLP engine something that youconfigure and control for yourenvironmentand the end user is educated why thismessage was not sent by a bounce backmessagehowever Megan then goes and said Megangoes home or is in a cafeteria and wantsto access Google drive through anotherapplications in this case monday.comshe authorizes that access but gets anerror message what that message says isyou cannot have access to Google Drivebecause you're not coming in from theregular corporate IP rangeit's an important factor here becauseremember Megan has gone home and she'sprobably Now using unmanaged devicesthis is an iPad in action at home whereshe tries to download a set of files butbecause it's an unmanaged device theadmin has configured policies so thatshe cannot download print such files ata home or device or an unmatched deviceso what you saw here was the ability tomagically classify files using AIclassification you saw the end usergetting educated when it came toegressing sensitive data and what youalso saw was to contextually protect theuser from downloading files when it isan unmanaged devicehow did the adminget to all of this what did she need toconfigure in order to make sure that heremployees are not in inadvertentlysharing datalet's take a quick look at Amanda ourMaster admin that has configured us afew of our security tools to make thishappenlet's start in the same sequence AIclassification which is the ability todo classify files is essentially a toolset that Amanda can configure for herorganization should be required tochoose the taxonomy for her dataclassification levels in this caserestricted confidential Etc and shouldbe asked to provide some set of trainingdata very small sets so that it isdoesn't become a burden for her to gocollect a ton of data and then providethat into the AI modelsonce that is done she would turn on autoapplication of labels and that's whenthe system starts applying files orapplying classification labels to filesnow next thing she has configured a dataprotection rule where she goes in andenables Gmail to be protected by the DLPpolicies in this case she is looking atmessages that are sent out of theorganization and she can add hercondition we offer a set of 50 plusdifferent out of box controls likesocial security number or piiinformation across the different regionsand then she can select what kind ofactions you would like to have in thiscase she is just fine-tuning her herrule to make sure that she has the rightlevel of application uhconfigured and then she'll go she'sgoing to block the message she can sendalerts to all the administrators in casesuch events happennow the important part here is for thoseof you who have used email and used dataprotection components we are bringingthat to the new modern platform andgiving you a lot of advancedcapabilities underneath it one of thosecapabilities is the ability for theadministrator to verify whether this DLPincident was a true incident or a falsepositive so admin goes in and looks atwhat was the incident that happened whatwas the DLP violation and then once youlook at the snippet of that content sothat she can quickly decide whether thiswas truly a flag or whether this wassomething which was a false falsepositive now in this case she's firstrequired to add a justification why doesthe admin want to look at user data andthat justification gets locked and afterthat she can go in and look into thedetails of the snippet which is providedhere for quick reference it has beenbuilt in a in a privacy preserving wayand we'll talk about that in a momentlast part when we talked about how youcan apply contextual controls to apis toother applications that are accessingyour your workspace environment the wayyou configure this is to essentiallylook at context aware access settings wecall it CAA lovingly and the admin inthis case has gone in and applied theparticular access level in an activemode now this is critical the admin getsto apply it for desktop browsers usecases for mobile devices or for apis andthe API surface is one of those which ina lot of times we have noticed folkseither missing on or not fullyprotecting in the same way they protectthe the use the the user initiatedinteractions so now you have contextavoid accessapplicable to apis and that's what willhelp the the customer to make sure thattheir users are not providing inadvertedaccess to other applications likemonday.comlast but not the least we have broughttogether context aware access and DLPtogether this is something that was notpossible before which enables you tosolve Advanced use cases ofunderstanding sensitive content and thecontext of whether a device is unmanagedor not whether it is the request iscoming from a particular IP or not so inthis case the admin goes in and createsa policy that would make sure that ifthe file if the device is unmanaged inthis case iOS then the user would beprevented from downloading such filesthe last part which I want to talk aboutis all of this goes into our audit logsin the later part of this demo we'llshow you how those order logs can betaken over to tools like Chronicle andthen can we use further for uh forfurther investigationwhat did you see you saw AIclassification in actionthe important part here is to make surethat your users do less you do less andyou you utilize AI systems in order tomake sure that your data can be wellclassifieddouble click on that for just a minutehow does this workwe use large language models tounderstand the context of a givendocument let me give you an examplethe word POC could mean proof of conceptperson of color and many other thingsbutunless you actually look at the contextof the entire file it's very hard tofigure out whether this document istruly sensitive or notso step one we are leveraging theadvancements in Ai and bringing that tofruition for our customersbut we have been very mindful ofdeveloping this in a way that canbenefit you and help you deploy in yourenvironmentthree things to note first these are allper customer models so none of themodels learn from each other you ownyour model these are all customized toyour environment these are privacypreserving to the extent that if we ifthe models see a social security numberthey would just note it as oh we saw asecurity number but not the actualcontent because we masked that from themodels let alone human readerssecond these are grounded in your datawhich is why we ask you to provide withprovide us or the models with sometraining set that's an important part tomake sure that we can predictefficiently uh the outcome for your foryour files and the last one iscontrolled user feedback what do I meanby that we need the users required afeedback loop to these models so thatthe models can get better over time butyou also don't want every single user inour organization to provide that kind ofa feedback because that contained themodel Effectiveness so if you have alarge organization that has dataGuardians people who understand yourcrown gels better you can designate themto provide suchfeedback to the models or if you are asmaller mid-sized organization that hasemployees or where employees understandthe implications of these you can rollit out to everyone so you get the choiceyou get the flexibilitythis one will leave my last show ofhands how many of youhave millions of files that you believehave not been classified yetalmost 50 of the room I'm amazed at theremaining 50 actually believes you haveyour data classifier that's fat on yourbackumyes so if if the the reason why I bringthis up is this system doesnot only does it scan your files in nearreal time when a file is created andapply a classification it can actuallygo back historically to all files inGoogle Drive and provide aclassification level automaticallyapplied to it so if you are worriedabout hey what kind of data do I havewhere is it sitting uh in terms of itsrisk profile in terms of how it shouldbe classified this tool can help you godo thatlet's move to the next piece of the demoyou saw DLP being configured with thenew platformum and also you saw the context awareDLP pieces where we have brought in thecontext aware engine and the DLP enginetogether for your Advanced use casesuh you also saw a set of advanced DLPcapabilities for Gmail like I said weare moving the Gmail capabilities ontothe newer platform so that you can youcan benefit from the advanced conditionsthat they offerand lastlywe are working very closely with ourBeyond Corp Enterprise team where we canprovide you with more insightsof how your users are accessing datathrough Chrome or through through thesurfaces outside workspace that can helpyou evaluate what kind of policies youwant to have in place will give youmeaningful insights so that youunderstand your employee behavior andyou can fine tune your controlsaccordinglythis is part of the reason why largecustomers like Roche have been reallyreally grateful for the capabilitiesthat we have offered to them they havebeen able to reduce their risk managethe right level of access with the rightlevel of users and right level of dataand while we have many such customerstoday we have one of them here with usChas Grundy who has graciously acceptedto talk to us about his experienceswelcome Chasthank you Nick Hill thank you so muchso a little bit of context here maybe somaybe you could tell the audience firsthow what kind of security tools do youhave where does Google workspacesecurity fit into that and what doesyour overall organizational uh securityposture look like sure so Googleworkspace is our core email calendaringchat collaboration storage for our wholeUniversity faculty staff studentscontractors temporary on call employemployees all of this so getting folksin there and taking advantage of all theGoogle tools out of the box that helpsus tremendously but it's just one pieceof a University's I.T ecosystem we areusing OCTA for identity accessmanagement but then also for groupmanagement we hook that into GoogleGroups so we can take advantage offeatures and benefits in both placeswe're using things like virtue for Emailencryption we use a lot of differentthird-party tools plugging them intoGoogle workspace so we can takeadvantage kind of The Best of BothWorlds that's great thank you forexplaining that to us what what wouldyou say is your approach when it comesto hybrid work for an organization aslarge as yours what is what has beenyour approach uh particularly from theend you the perspective and as thechampion of end users we were hybridbefore hybrid was cool I think theproblem is in in universities we havefaculty all over the world we havestudents studying abroad and going allover the place our staff are travelingconstantly we're collaborating insideand outside the university otherinstitutions corporate vendors Partnersit doesn't matter so all of these thingswe've learned with hybrid we are thingswe've been doing for a long time we'vejust gotten a lot better at it morerecently I think most of our our peersand our colleagues would say the sameyou guys have been doing this for a longtime securing endpoints is reallydifficult and is very expensive and inhigher ed where the the power flow andthe model of how people work is notsuper hierarchical uh trying to getpeople to follow the the carrot ratherthan chasing a stick or running from astick that's an important step for ustoo so getting folks into workspacewhere it's going to be an easierexperience it's going to be faster it'sgoing to be a better you knowcollaboration experience for them thathelps us tremendously as itprofessionals not have to worry aboutevery single endpoint we can shrink thata task a tax service by getting the datainto Google and not sitting on theirlaptop and their laptop and their laptopthat's amazing thank you for that tiphow would you describe your evaluationof security tools when you wereconsidering what could help you as youwere going through your digitaltransformation what were the keycriteria was Google able to help youwith any of of your goals or not and wewant some candid answers here so that wecan help make it better for everyoneabsolutely yeah we launched a campaign afew years ago called Google first and itfollowed our Cloud first principles andlet's try to use a cloud first beforewe're doing you know on-prem or buildour ourselves thing Google first wasreally how do we take advantage of thetools we already have in workspace whichwe are in front of every user every dayhow do we do that first before we lookto some other Solutions so let's try todrive people into using Google Docs andsheets and slides so building trainingprograms engagement programs to pullthem into that that was a reallyimportant part of it and along thisprocess we started to retire old thingsanybody have a legacy application you'dlove to get rid of we've got a bazillionof them one of those was this oldstorage platformAFS we started launching AFS Androidfile system developed by MIT in the 80swe launched this thing in 1989 and wefinally got rid of it a few years agoand along that process was taking thedata from AFS and moving into the nextplatform and the next platform and thenext one and eventually findingourselves saying why don't we all useGoogle Drive as our core every day everyend user file storewhen we move stuff into Google Drive wediscovered files that had been sittingback there since the 1990s including adatabase of social security numbersidentities employees students stafffaculty all of thatand in that's just hiding in somebody'sdriving they didn't know they had itit's not like they were trying to doanything wrong but it's been sitting outthere for a very long time DLP pickedthis stuff up we discovered right awaywe were able to delegate management ofDLP to general counsel so they don'thave to come to it to get helpinvestigation Center let's just respondto things more quickly without having togo to a security engineer necessarily toto you know remediate that It spedthings up and it's taken a lot of loadoff of itbut we all still feel a little safer soit's kind of a Best of Both Worlds andthat that's an amazing story I think itit happens a whole lot that we hear fromour customers about we think we knowwhere the data is or what's sensitivebut once you start utilizing some of thetools remember I talked about earlierhow your data is in the cloud and we'reable to you know find you reallyinteresting important details for thatdata because it's sitting in the in thecloud so thank you for that before I letyou go one last questionumoverall from a philosophy perspective itsounds like uh you guys have adoptedGoogle first you've got a saferexperience a smoother experience whatwould you say is the overall involvementfrom various parts of your organizationor how would you describe yourphilosophy when it comes to securitywell security is everybody'sresponsibility it's not an I.T functionsecurity is not a thing where you've gota group of folks over here who just sayno you've got the whole user the wholeuser base all of our campus every singleone of them is a potential Vector for anattack a breach their accounts theirendpoints their data all those thingswhat they're doing and who they'recollaborating with it's everybody'sresponsibility and we've been workinghard to train our our campus and getthem to buy in and so much of that isinvisible to them because they don'tknow they're being more secure they'recoming to get this great newcollaboration feature or more storagespace or whatever this new workflow orprocess is we're making those possibleby giving it to them in Google and thenwe're sleeping better at nightthat's so amazing thank you for sharingthat story it is amazing to know thatthe tool is simple enough for you togive it out to General counsels otherparts of the teams share some load andthat's one thing that we strive for youwant to make sure that you have powerfultools yet simple enough for yourutilization thank you so much chance forsharing your experience we reallyappreciate you having it thank youforeignaddition to the things that you saw inthe demo be aware that we are notstopping there there are a whole lot ofnew things that we are announcing as apart of our launches you saw the demosfor context aware access for apis yousaw it forum the monitor mode for context awareaccess and DLP evidence Snippets the rowat the bottom is the stuff that youdidn't see in demos but they areavailable for you to use and sign up forfor example trust rules for directoriesis going into beta really soon auditPrivileges and log exports are coming toyou soon as well and so is IOS VPP anduser enrollment beta capabilities howcan you use those we'll show that to youin a secondlet's switch gears and move into thesecond part uh how do we help youprevent threats before they emerge or asthey emerge now againlet's show you a demohere is one of our recent advancementsthat we have announced into beta veryrecently this is where you as anadministrator can set up the export ofyour audit logs in a near real-timebasis and push them over to chroniclechronicle which is the screen here hasdeveloped specific out of box modulesthat would help you understand yourincidents way better than before theseare all based on workspace Clause drivenby AInow let's say the outcome of thatinvestigation for the administrator wasoh I want to change the two SV settingsfor one of my users now this user goesor this admin goes in and says oh thisis an exec we need to give them someextra time so that the 2sv enrollmentcan happen that's what you see on yourscreen they had to prevent a provide ajustification and they had to send itover for approval why because otherwiseyou can have inadvertent changes in yourorganization we call it multi-partyapprovals something that will requiretwo administrators to sign off oncritical changes for your administrativesettings that is also a capability thatis coming to Beta really soon andsomething which some of our customersare alreadyso what did you see here you sawcapabilities to protect against Insiderrisk through the novel way of gettingyour logs including Gmail drive andGoogle Chrome pushed out to Chronicle ina seamless fashion much more efficientthan what it used to be in the pastit also does not require to say for youto set up any intermediaries these lawsgo directly to Chronicle with with theconfigurations that you makenext you also saw what we are calling asmulti-party approvals this isessentially an administrative tool tomake sure that you get uh you know youget two people to sign off before you dosomething nuclear in your in yourorganizationcustomers like violia and I believe someof them might be in the audience thankyou for trying this out for us a lot ofthese capabilities uh we are building tomake sure that your organizations cancan stay secure and we really love toget the feedback from all of you as youstart testing these capabilitiesI'm not going to stop there there theworld of cookie theft has beenbecoming more and more relevant intoday's day and age their Advancedattacks and what Google is doing todayis to make sure that we can provide youwith new tools and some of them areturned on by default both of thesecapabilities are turned on by by defaultfor your users what are thesecapabilities let's talk about that for asecondso first thing is we are we areintroducing a high frequency cookierotation into your into yourorganizations what it means is thewindow of opportunity for any potentialhacker is very small because the cookiesdo tend to get rotated pretty quicklythe second thing is we have leveragedour AI capabilities to determine uh andchallenge a user when it comes todoing sensitive actions within Gmail ifsome of you have noted our recent pressreleases we did the same thing withadmin console settings as well so we areon a Continuum to make sure all surfacesare covered with better cookie theftprotectionsthe next one is today we are announcingthat we are going to mandate two SVsettings for all administrators forthose of you that attended some of theprevious sessions we have about 10million paying customers today and thisis an arduous trust to move the industryforward a lot of you already have two SVsettings turn on particularly for youradministrators but if you look at thelong tail we still find a lot ofcustomers who are not benefiting fromthis capability this rollout will happenover the next several quarters and wewill be doing it in phases so thecustomers who get impacted in phase onewould be notified and with phase two andfifth phase three and so on and so forthso be aware that this is coming for alladministrators in in near futureand last but not leastin addition to workspace security toolswhat you also get is a whole host oftools from Google Cloud security pleasedo take a look at some of these sessionsout there and we've recently alsoannounced Partners New Partnerships withleading vendors like VMware OCTA andjumpcloud to help you with your securityJourneyswe take a lot of pride in serving ourcustomers but at the same time we wantto be realistic there's a reason whyalmost 10 million paying customers areusing us and keeping their data safe ifyour organization name is on the slidethank you we really appreciate makingyour feedback to make sure that we cancreate a better stronger and a saferorganization overall for for everyoneand if there's one thing that you takeaway from this talk as I was talkingearlier it really matters on the foundthe foundation that we have built forthis specific set of use cases while youuse workspace we want to make sure thatyou can take benefit or leverage thesecapabilities in your organizationbecause remember like I was talkingearlierwould like everybody to have thosebeautiful mornings with the pink andorange sky and a Karma ocean without theEmergency Services part right andtherefore we are developing these toolsso that you can use them appropriatelyin your respective organizationsand as I promised this is how you canaccess all the early launch features uhthis leads to a Google form you can signup on a per feature basis so we want togive you only the stuff that you reallycare about or you really need so you cansign up for all the capabilities that weshowed you today or you can select someif you sign up in this form in the nextfew weeks somebody from the Googlesecurity team product security teamwould reach out to you and give you theappropriate steps for signing up forthese feature once again we care aboutyour feedback and that's why we want torelease some of these newer capabilitiesinto with with you folks our trustedtesters before we launch them to Generalavailabilitythank you"
