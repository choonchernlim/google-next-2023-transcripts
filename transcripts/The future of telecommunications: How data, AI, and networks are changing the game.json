and I've had theopportunity to work on the Technologiesbehind many of these relationshipsthese days I hadGoogle clouds global telecommunicationsbusiness and Google distributed CloudEdgeand today I'm excited to share the workthat we have been doing the past fewyears at Google helping csps digitallytransform their businesswhich is really a continuation of thatlong-standing relationship that we havehad with cspsand it's my honor that I'll be sharingthe stage today with two industryluminarieshermine Mehta who is the chief digitaland Innovation officer at BT group andScott Petty who is the chief technologyofficer at Vodafone grouplook throughout this event you wouldhave heard from speakers from all partsof Google Cloudfrom our customers from our partnersabout how AI plays an instrumental rolein our latest Innovations in data infrasecurity and moreand real world examples of how we arepartnering with customers to Drive NewGrowth and innovationand in this session I'm excited to shinethe transformation Spotlight on theTelecommunications industrylook this is an industry that isundergoing massive changeswith csps facing growth and costpressuresbutthey're embracing this change by raisingtheir AI game by modernizing theirinfrastructure by putting their data towork and building Cloud native Networksand so how are we as Google Cloudhelping them with this journey of theirslook we help our CSP customers withhorizontal products and solutions acrosstheir I.T organizations much as we woulddo for any other Enterprise in any otherindustrybut in addition what we are doing forthe Telecom industry specifically isthat we are a ensuring that csps canmeet their industry specific needswhether that's around securityprivacysovereignty availability and so onand B we are also buildingCSP specific industry Solutions andproducts some of which I will touch uponin the session todaywe are also working very closely withPartners to ensure that and there's anopen ecosystem and such that theirsystems and processes work with workwell with oursnow whether that's network networkequipment providers OSS BSS providersNetwork analytic providers customeranalytics platformsum global system integrators and so onnow putting all of these together Googlecloud is enabling csps to transform inthree key areas that are top of mind forthemAI Transformation Network modernizationand mod and monetizationlet's explore these three areas in moredetailso when it comes to data and AIGtransformation we are helping our CSPcustomers reimagine customer experiencesNetwork and IIT operations and Workforceproductivityand this is by turning data into astrategic asset and a competitiveadvantagewe are working with customers around theworld on their data and AI Journeyfor example Optus in Australia has beenrelying on Google Cloud's contact centerAI since 2020 to provide customers withpersonalized and meaningfulconversations using AITelecom Argentina is using our AI Opsproducts to dramatically reduce the needfor human intervention and furtherreducing the mean time to understandingand repairing network issuesand you may some of you may have seenthe breakout presentation yesterdayabout how telefonica Germany is workingwith Nokia and Google Cloud to bring inMore Energy Efficiency into their RadioNetworksand you will hear from hermine and Scottabout shortly about how they arepartnering with us on their data and AIJourneyssecondly when it comes to networkmodernization we are helping our CSPcustomers build Cloud native automatedNetworksthereby enabling them to to operate andscaletheir networks efficiently and whilealso launching Services more quicklyfor this we have introduced productssuch as Google distributed cloud withtelecommunications as one of the firstindustries that it was targeted forgdce is a fully managed hardware andsoftware solution providing oneconsistentagile operating model for multiple racksin a few sites running let's say thepacket core to single server runningradio Access Network workloads in tensof thousands of sites Nationwideas part of this we haveoptimized it to run high performanceNetwork workloads and more recently wehave added features such as boundaryproxy Bastion host and survivabilitymode to help csps meet their securityavailability and sovereigntyrequirementslast year together with the LinuxFoundation we launched project nephew toenable Cloud nativeautomation of Telecom Network functionsand the underlying Cloud infrastructureusing kubernetes Technologies and intentbased automationand just earlier this month we proudlyannounced the release of race onethereby significantly signifisimplifying deployment and life cyclemanagement of both the underlyinginfrastructure and the network functionsthat run on topthrough these products and solutions weare externalizing our learnings over theyears of building and operating in asoftware defined and an automated wayGoogle's own Global Network which is oneof the largest networks on the planetin just the past 12 months we haveshared several announcements in thisspace with key customersfor example telenet which was showcasedearlier this morning in theinfrastructure developer Keynotevideo where GDC is now driving themodernization and cloudification of itsNetworkDeutsche Telecom deployed and verifiedEricsson 5G packet core functions on GDCEdge in a pilot that successfullydemonstrated deployment time in minutesrather than weeksgo to telefonica who is a who are doinga proof of concept for testing purposeshas implemented GDC Edge in its datacenter through which 5G code network isbeing operatedand startup who we are supporting asthey create an open scalable secure andenergy efficient Cloud native Networkfor Enterprises in Singaporeand thirdly on monetization we arepartnering with csps to create newrevenue streams and grow existing onesfor example to help them grow theirbusiness on the consumer side welaunched Telecom subscriber insightsthis help csp's Target customeracquisition cross-sell and upsell usecases and also increases customerretentionit does so by ingesting and normalizingdata from various sources to createthings like next best offerbut it doesn't stop there it uh weleverage Telecom subscriber insights toalso push notifications to uh thecustomers devices and that helps incustomer response and to helps close theloopwe are also partnering with csps so thatthey can sell their Enterprise customerssolutions that are Beyond justconnectivity this could be for exampleenhancing productivity and collaborationby bundling Google workspace andChromebooks and pixel and so on orreselling Google Cloud to help customersmodernize their platforms it could beenabling csps customers to bring intheir own data as well as the CSP datatogether to create new analytics modelsor extending extending there reach tosmbs by providing them an SMBMarketplacesome examples of how we are partneringwith csps include indosat uridoHutchison who has successfully launcheda data analytics platform which ishelping their clients across sectors towith real-time insights improve decisionmaking and faster Roiorange who is a strategic partner forGoogleand Google and workspace is monetizingour joint Solutions in their Enterpriseand mid-market segmentsand we announced earlier uh yesterdaythat we are partnering with BT enablingcustomers to connect to the Cross Cloudnetwork using their Global fabricproductsGoogle's Global Network and BT networkis interconnected globally to enableEnterprise branches and users to connectto cloud-based applications with highestreliability and performanceand speaking of the BT group I amexcited to welcome herd mean to sharemore about how they are partnering withGoogle Cloud on their transformationJourneyfor the uninitiated BT group is amultinational telecoms and digitalservices company that is based out ofthe UK with revenues of over 20 billionpounds 30 billion customers operationsin 180 countries and a really vast datastateand what it's 175 year history and theorganization has gone through manychanges but is now going one of itsbiggest transformation as it transformsuh the organization around a digitalagenda expanding its reach Beyond Telcoas it makes new Digital Servicessupporting new marketshermine is a driving force behind thattransformation serving as a stiffdigital and Innovation officer she alsoserves as a non-executive director atLloyd's banking group so as anincredible perspective over data and AItransformation challenges across manybusiness that many businesses are facingshe has been at the Forefront of dataand AI for most of her career and we arereally really looking forward to hearingmore from her please join me inwelcoming hermineso I mean I believe you are in theprocess of migrating most of your dataand AI workloads over to Google Cloudwhere are you with that journey and andwhat has the Imp what is the impact youhave seenwell first of all it's not most becauseuh I'm a very binary person is you knowUncle zero or one so it's all of ourdataum it's always good to hear yeahand I think it's been umit's a true transformation because thishas not been about the technology changefrom moving from on-prem to to Cloudit's not been just about embracing gcpit's been abouta real cultural thinking transformationas well people transformation and if youif you were to count the number ofpeople since I came to BT about two twoand a half years ago that told me that Ican't do this and everybody had a verygood reason uh and if I had a penny foruh every time the word regulatory wasused I'd be a very very rich womanum I think it's uh it's ironical thathow we create our own barriers in ourown minds and sometimes create our ownlimitations there are some reallimitations but they're always wayaround it you just have to think a bitmore creatively or a bit more deeply butwe're fully committed to this we'regoing to take 100 of our data move it tothe cloud not umnot have any differentiation in the inthe middle we started the program aboutI think about 18 months agoum we've just crossed about 80 percentoh we will be done by the end of thisyearand I think it's been um it's not justit's not the putting of the data intogcp that's really unlocking everythingit is really the use and the value it'screating on top we've promised to createabout half a billion of net new valuefor the companyand uh now with the advancements that AIis making I'm really challenging my teamand I think by the time some of them arein the crowd so by the time I go backthat number might change to 1 billionso we'll see but I think the potentialis there for us to double this over overthis five-year period that we arelooking at to complete thistransformation but it is absolutely uhthe way to go in fact if we hadn't donethat I think our adoption of a lot ofnot only Jenny Jenny is only one partthat worksum in one segment but it's the deeperuse of AI and ml we would not have beenable to adapt to it and accelerate alarge part of that as quickly as we weare going to over the next few monthsyou touched upon some many manyinteresting topics so I'll dig into someof these okay so you talked aboutum half a billion or even a billionpounds that's up to like five percent ofyour overall revenues soum can you can you tell us more like interms of where are those uh where arethose coming fromso they're coming from actually verydeep use of AI in all its differentforms fromum small things like driving hyperpersonalization on the you know on onthrough our all Omni Channel productswhich means that literally we are movingaway fromtraditional segmentation that mostcompanies do to actually saying it's asegment of one so what are you going tosegment so if you've got 30 millioncustomers you've got 30 million segmentsand really driving that hyperpersonalization which is increasing bothactually it's increasing considerationit's including increasing conversion andit's increasing Revenue it's increasingretention it's reducing churn it'shaving a whole lot of impactbut the bigger impact is also providingdifferent levels of insights for exampleone of the things we are we are lookingto do is drive different propensitymodels for the sales guys to actuallytell them that the same effort that youput in we will tell you which customerwhat product at what time and that sameeffort is going to be yield into a muchbigger you know uh conversion rate forthem as well so their effort is wellspentit's also coming fromsome very intelligent things that we aredoing where we are actually because weare able to understand the personalityof a customer as a segment of one wealso understand the personality of forexample our call center agents as anagent of oneand when somebody calls to be able tomake the right pairingand if you guys thought that it is onlythe tenders of the world that domatchmaking you're absolutely wrong thetelecoms are the biggest matchmakers inthe worldbecause that's what we do from firstthing in the morning when our Engineersare going out to lay fiber we'reactually tasking them to say whichengineer is best to do which job andhence we are matchmaking the job to theengineer where a customer calls we'rematchmaking the customer with the callcenter saying which agent is mostum you know is the best to to eitherservice or sell or whatever to do thatcustomerand it's leading to a very differenttransformationI'm a big proponent of drivingum diversity and inclusion in differentorganizations as well and one of thebiggest psychological changes that itimpact that it's had on me and it's hardon you know the dni team as well is justimagine a world where living UK is oneof the most diverse countries in the inthe worldthe demographic in in the UK is is justphenomenally diversebut if you are going to do that matchingreally successfullyI need the call center and our ownemployees to have exactly the same levelof diversity as our consumers because ifI don't have that who am I going tomatch toI'm always going to have a sub-optimalmatch rather than the perfect match soit is changing the organization it'ssuch fundamental ways which the worlddidn't think that would happen so Ithink the power of insights and thepower of data is much more than we havethe insight forand I really feel we we wantBT to be you know converting it from aTelco to a Tech Co but much moreimportantly be a very data driven and AIfirst organization and I think we're notvery far from thatI must say I did not realize the levelof matchmaking that was happening evento even to the extent of oh there'snobody from Tinder hereumyou know like one of the other thingsthat got my attention was you talkedabout the let's say the organizationresistance as well as the organizationalchange that you had to drive I have likeeven for programs that we do withinGoogle and whenever we introducesomething quite categoricalwe encountered these kinds of uh we haveto make these organizational andcultural changes can you tell us moreabout how did you actually put that inMotion in your company at your scale Idefinitely can but this advice comeswith a lot of caution please do not tryit in your own organization because I'mnot sure this is the best thing to dobutum I'm a very polarizing person so Ifind it the way I find it difficult tounderstand the gray in the middle is soit's very binary for me I do the same inthe organization so I make it very easyto polarize people and say either you'rein the camp or not oral camp and then Iknow how to deal with people who are inthe camp and I know how to deal withpeople who are out of the camp what isvery difficult is to deal with the massin the middle which you neither know arethey in the camp but they're not in thecamp and in the bank camp in the morningbut not in the camp in the evening andthat'suh that's a diversity of the humanpsychology that I have neitherunderstood nor I think I ever willbut the biggest piece isum you know we all pretend that we arein the technology sector but a lot of uswe are actually we're in the peoplebusiness and you have to find differentways of cracking throughum you know whatever is causing thatthat resistance a large part of thatresistanceis coming from either their own inertiaof not wanting to try somethingdifferent or it's coming from the fearof the unknown which is actually the newor it's just pure lazinessso you've got to figure out whichever itis there is no cure for laziness butthere's a cure for the othersum and a large part of that is sometimesyou have to be equally ruthless to saythat someone doesn't want to go on thatJourney you can't force them to go onthe journey and the best thing is justpart ways and you can't be shy aboutthatum and that is actually the best thingyou would do for their career becausethey might have a very happy successfulcareer somewhere else and we should givethem the opportunity to do that so Ilove to promote people outside theorganization if they are not going tocome along the journeybut you what you find is if you are notleading by control but you're leading bycontextand you paint the picture of where wewill end upmany people actually want to be part ofthat journey and that is the beauty ofthe human race that you really got tobuild up on I mean I've I'll ask theaudience how many of you wake up in themorning and say I'm gonna go and do theshittiest job possible today at workum and I I one hand coming up over therewell there's always one thingumbut that's not how human beings thinkeverybody wants you know everybody wantsto to do the good job and they want tomake a difference no matter what they doand that's what you got to appeal onbut I I would I would definitely say toleaders driving large Transformationsout thereum and I was talking about this at adifferent organization earlier thismorningyou if you really want to driveTransformations you have to give up onone very fundamental thing and that youhave to give up on the inherent need tobe likedso if you really want to be liked andloved by everybody then you're notdriving a transformationuh then you're just bringing about someincremental changebut if you really want to transformsomething you're breaking a lot of eggsand as I was saying you can't walk oneggshells and break a lot of eggs thetwo metaphors can't mix together youhave to be comfortable with saying thereare many people who are going tocriticize this many people who are notgoing to like this many people who aregoing to be vocal about it and thatshould be okay if you don't have thecourage to have that big debate and holdyour own don't start a transformation ordon't be a part of itokay that's that's well said but like Isaid don't try this at homeyou already touched upon many differentuses of the data and using AI for thatcan you tell us more about like howyou're approaching this current wave ofgenerative AII mean this is really causing um youknow a lot of thinking within theorganization for two three reasons oneisas most of my team and my organizationknows the one virtue which I didn't havebefore I came to BT and I've acquired alittle bit but not a lot of is a whatyou call patienceum so for me I'm seeing this this isthis is a great opportunity for me toget back to what I am great at which isdriving at PACE and moving at speed andI think this can reallyum embracing you to gonna cut you knowliterally months if not years out of ourtransformation simple examplesum I mean we've gotum our you know we've been in theconversational AI space for a long timebut teaching those models to be reallyaccurate to really be able to bring thepower of human and artificialintelligence together takes a long timeand most of us actually when we drivethat we get through the big use casespretty quickly but it's the tale whichis really really long that takes you along timebut if you are the contrast of that isthat really works when you are havingthat broad segmentation of yourcustomersif on one hand you're driving thesegment one which means every customeryou are encouraging them to be uniqueyou don't have just one offer you'retailoring it to every every customeryou're even tailoring a little bit ofthe price points to every customerthen you take away also the need thatyou are going to be able to take a wholechunk of people have one workflow andsay this will take care of all of theirservice so you're creating a complexityand if you don't solve for it you'renever going to catch up and I think thisis the straight this is the conundrumthat most organizations are facing withand we make enough progress that we cancome to stage and talk about it but notenough progress that truly transformsthe companyif you really want to do that you haveto get to the tail and you have to beall in you can't be you can't be half inon that one and I think this is thebiggest thing that is going to changeand this is the first time thattechnology is speaking the humanlanguage rather than human learning thetechnology language and I think it haschanged the perception of what is theart of the possibleand so two things that we are seeingchange one is the human belief that thenew world is not tomorrow it is hereright nowthat has completely changed and I don'tneed to drive that in all of my businessthey're seeing it everywhere and theythey are now for the first time steppingback and saying oh this is actuallyhereso that has cut down a large part of thehard work of people transformation thatyou have to do every time you drive sucha big change but the second piece isit's actually making it easier to movemuch faster as welland I think we'd be we'd be fooled notto really jump on that horse and ride itas fast as we canbecause the customers are so soon goingto get so accustomed to itum you knowumit might beyou might not invite me again if I talkabout Amazon on this stage but um butyou know Amazon has changed our ownexpectation of how things should bedelivered to our houseand when a when a courier is certain ora company certainly says I need three tofive days of shipping and we say whatage are they living in because you gotso used to do not forget about next daydelivery now it's about you knowdelivery today itself it has changed theexpectation of the consumers the samething is going to happen the more ourcustomer bases get used to interactingwith a very different world and solvingtheir problems like this and beingunderstood as an individual for who theyare and not as a bracketthat's what they're going to expect fromevery other companyeven if they are in different Industriesand different segments so the onus is onus we want to be the first one toactually create that differentiation andnot the last one who's just trying tofollow throughthank you so much I mean for theseinsightsum with thatplease join me in thanking hermine thankyouthank youthank youso hermine gave her perspective aboutand thank you for that like in terms ofhow you are using how you are goingalong on the AI and the Gen AI Journeyumwhat I'd like to share right now is ourperspective on how we what we are seeingin this spacewe feel we believe that it has thepotential to transform our industry in afew different waysjust to pick up a fewum I mean talked about improvingcustomer experiences and we can and weare seeing the use of that forconversational support Bots but alsosummarization of let's say help articlesthat were that would that could beavailable on the websiteanother great one is being justassisting uh creation of marketingcontent by generating Rich multimediamaterial as well as as we just discusseddriving hyper personalized subscriberoffersuh or for that matter improving Networkplanning and operations to to help theoperations Folks by for summarizinghighlyum High very long highly complexstandards documents operational data andthen synthesizing them and making themaccess accessible through naturallanguage querieswe've also seen the use of codegeneration capabilities let's say byKodi to on one hand a write-up speed upthe software development exercise wherethere are people who are also using thisexperimenting withquickly spinning up config files andeffectively using that in the progresstowards our ultimate Northstar of fullyautomated Networksunderpinning all of this we are ensuringthat Enterprise readinessthrough easy integration with all theEnterprise systems thatthe Telecom industry haswe are truly excited to bring these newInnovations to our customers and helpthem along in their AI Journeythese Journeys start in various forms asyou can see from some of the exampleshere and some of which I have alreadycovered earlier in the talkand to learn about another extremelyfascinating Journey I'm now excited toWelcome to the stage Scott Petty thechief technology officerof Vodafone group and a member of theVodafone executive committee Vodafone isthe largest pan-european and Africantelecoms company providing mobile andservices company in 17 in 17 countriesand they partner with mobile networks in46 more and also are a world leader inan Internet of Thingsas vodafone's group CTO Scott isaccountable for driving Innovationembedding simplification and delivery ofvodafone's Technology strategy andreflecting the growing importance oftechnology as would in vodafone'stransformation as a telecom technologyCommunications companyover his tenure at Vodafone Scott hasled various Marquee initiativesoperational excellence the launch of 5Gand shared rural Network scheme and thedevelopment of products acrossconnectivity iot and convergeCommunications to just name a fewplease join me in welcoming Scott[Applause]thank you peaceso Scottumyou've also been a great been a greatpartner for us over the years what doyou think is the strength of therelationship with Google and GoogleCloudsure we've had a long relationship withGoogle obviously being a mobile operatoror a wireless operator as you like tosay in the US in all the markets weoperate in Android's been a reallyimportant part of our channel strategyand our go to market strategy we've donea lot of joint product developmenttogether in areas like RCS so bringingcommunication Services together and ofcourse we're an advertising customerhas been a great relationship ourrelationship with gcp started actuallyback in December2019 and then and ultimately in acontract about a year later as westarted to build our digitaltransformationwhat we like about Google as a companyis is you're a problem-solving partneryou're different to most organizationswho like to sell you something Googlereally work with you to solve problemsand and solve those problems at scalethat drive benefits for us as anorganizationthat has some some real benefits asyou're trying to transform yourorganization and building thosePartnerships to make sure we canreally glad to hear thatsoum what are some of the biggest datachallenges that you are seeing and againlike as part of this migration you'veyou've migrated a lot of your data overto Google Cloudand what what is the impact you havebeen seeing from those yeah data is sucha critical component of of our digitaltransformation we started back in 2019with this Vision to really transformVodafone as a company and we we thinkabout our digital transformation inthree pillars the first one isSimplicity how can we make and optimizehow we operate our business and that'sall about saving costs if you canautomate if you can drive processes youcan really drive a better return in yourbottom line the second pillar wascustomers how do we service ourcustomers better as customers moved awayfrom retail stores and contact centersto digital channels they wanted to buyonline in our world they're they'rereally importantum moments in the year on iPhone launchday a pixel launch day how well yourwebsite and your digital channelsresponds dictates how much market shareyou get in those areas so how well wecan service our customers is reallyimportant and probably the mostimportant pillar was our growth pillarhow could we create new products andservices adjacent to our coreconnectivity business like FinancialServices like iot that would create newsources of revenue for us then we wouldhave a digital transformation that wasreally changing the company as a wholethe problem with a Telco is we have 30Years of Legacy 30 Years of Legacysystems we haven't turned many thingsoff we still run 2G we still run lots offixed products we have lots of Legacysystems so trying to build those digitalTransformations without a common datalayer is almost impossible everything isin different places it's all gotdifferent master keys it's impossible tobring together so we we recognize at thestart we needed to build a data ocean asa way to bring that data together thatwould enable analytics bi machinelearning Ai and enable thoseapplications in those pillars and and wespend a lot of time choosing the rightpartner for that and we felt Google wasthe right partner you'd made some reallygood investments in analytics based onyour own business and what you've beendoing in in ads and other areas but moreimportantly we thought you'd be a greatdevelopment partner for us to help solvesome of the really tricky problems andproblem number one was actuallyingestion how do you get the data fromall of those Legacy systems into thatdata ocean encrypt it on the Fly do itat speed build a common data mode and beable to put it back in the in the in theThe Source system at speed that didn'texist it wasn't available in the marketand we were able to put teams togetherwith you guys to develop that as aproduct that that would reallyFast Track our our development once wehave the data ocean we can start tobuild capabilities that sit on top ofthat everyone talks about the things weall like to talk about always onmarketing how do we do CVM better how dowe sell to our customers better how dowe buildum AI based tools we have a productrecommender so when our agencyinterfacing with a with a customer on acall or in a retail store it's listeningand it's taking that data and thenmaking the right recommendation for thetower from the products that go withthem really exciting cases and they andthey build revenue actually the onesthat really move the needle are reallyin that simplification pillar taking allour networks analytic Network analyticsdata with our CPE data and be able touse that to service our customers betterand automate that process takes hugeamounts of cost out of our serviceorganization so enables a set ofapplications sitting on top of that thatreally transforms the way you can driveyour your digital transformationprobably our biggest bet though in inthe relationship came uh 18 months agowe decided to move our sap uh S4 Hanainstance from on-prem you can imaginefor a company like us that operates inso many markets with Tower sharing dealsand lots of JVS we have a very complexFinancial system and component and itwas really slowing down the business andour ability to be agile we built athree-phase program to migrate all ofthat estate into to gcp I have to sayprobably the most seamless project I'veever worked on in fact the day after wewent live with phase one I was travelingaround with our chief procurementofficer and he said to me Scott did younot do the evoter cloud migration on theweekend because nothing had gone wrong Isaid yeah it all happened no problemsyou couldn't believe it he couldn'tbelieve that we've been able to to dothat migration to to Cloud that'sunlocked a huge amount of value for usfirst of all it's dramatically improvedthe performance of our financial systemit's reduced our month then close by twodays which to a CFO is a really big dealit's dramatically improved theperformance of a whole set of thefunctions but it's put all of our coredata related to financials in the sameplace as our data ocean that gives us anability to build really complex Ai andml tools at scale leveraging thoseplatforms so it's reallydata I think is really overlooked thedata ocean how important it is to adigital transformation how getting thatarchitecture right is criticallyimportant and investing in that toenable the tools that come on top ofthat everyone's really excited about theapplications you launch but without thatlayer and that fabric you have no chanceof success you were mentioning somethinguh just beforethe session about how you have theseyou're bringing multiple differentdomains on top of this data ocean as anexample Network and customer data canyou just speak more about that and howhow you were able to convince all ofthese different parts to come togetherand use the same data ocean yeah greatquestion a little bit carrot a littlebit stickum hopefully mostly carrot look the datais the company's data and and you needto make that available to theapplications that sit on top of that Ithink we're able to prove with some ofthe early use cases that if we workedtogether we could break down the silosof the company between care operationsconsumer to build really greatcapabilities and use cases that thatexpand across those and we needed to dothat through an effective model the mostpowerful way though is giving them thetools the capability to do thatthemselves I I passionately believe ifyou need it to build your data andanalytics capability then you've got abig problem because you're going to be abottleneck you're never going to havethe capacity that you need you need tobe able to giving them low code tools webuild a product using vertex AI calledAI booster which enables the business tobuild their own use cases inside a safeframework it fits within our AIframework it aligns with our data Fabricand the tools that we use they're notthey can't break anything but they canbuild use cases that sit across that andthat creates a flywheel effect where wecan focus on getting the data in thesystem managing the data effectivelyworking at scale but the business can dowhat they need to do to build anexperiment with the use cases that aregoing to make a difference to themcan we actually touch upon some of theuse cases themselves that that I havemade that have brought up some of thebiggest impacts I'll start on theSimplicity sidesum maybe it's my operations backgroundbut but we've had some really great uhuse cases in this area my favorite isactually in networks so networks were anearly believer in the data ocean that ifwe could build it an ocean of networkinformation they could really simplifythe way that they operateprimarily around OSS so OSS are thetools that we use to monitor networksand all the configuration Etc in a Telcothat's a super complex environment eachOSS tool has its own data model its owntool set you have to connect that tooltalk your probes in the network andgather Network information super supercomplex projects lots of spaghetti veryvery expensive to run we've been able tosince we went live remove 120 OSS toolsfrom our organization we've moved to amodel where the data ocean has the datawe use Dynamo to do the ingestion fromthe network and the elements and thenOSS just becomes a presentation you knowthat sits on top of that you can useautomation tools to build all thecapabilities that you want to sit aroundthat they had a fundamental improvementin our operations not just in cost butactually in network performancepredictability when able to able topredict much more accurately when thingsare going to go wrong in the networkwhere the storms are going to have animpact where the congestion is going tohave an impact we've been able to mergethat with external data Facebookanalytics data for instance to use it tomake smart Network planning decisionsaround where should we build morecapacity that's going to have aneconomic return that wouldn't have aneconomic return that that's possiblebecause you build that that core layerum let me talk about the middle channelso how do we service our customersbetter some really good examples herewhere we've been able to take data fromthe CPE particularly in our fixedbusinessum fixed customers when they lose theirinternet connection they get reallyangry like really really angry becauseif they're a TV customer they get youcannot believe how angry they getparticularly if they're watching theirfavorite sport so being able to analyzewhat's happening in the network and theCPE and be able to do really simplethings realize that the fixed access isprobably going to fail so why don't weswap you over to our cellular backup onthat device automatically so that theuser experience is seamless those areall possible through the automation thatyou can build and you drive animprovement in your customer experiencewe use AI in our loyalty programs as anexample loyalty is a you log into ourapp we offer you a free coffee a freesource you draw it's a really dumb appbecause how do we know you like sausagerolls how do we know that you likecoffee and you might flick past it usingAI tools we can start to use our CVMdata more information leveraging thepreferences information that you give usas a user to then build a much moreintelligent loyalty program tailoringthose I really like I mean segment ofone concept where you're reallytailoring that to to a masspersonalization that fits across thereand then I think it helps us sell betterI talked about product recommenders inthose areas those those Driveefficiencies in the business that aresuper effectiveand just touching upon now a genie I Iknow that we were just talking aboutlike you have started uh looking intothat area also you and you have a bunchof a bunch of developers working on itcan you share more about some of the usecases that are resonating for youthere's certainly a lot of hype aroundChennai I don't think I've had a meetingthis year that someone hasn't talkedabout Jedi even people who sell fiberconnectors and networks we'll talk aboutit um look I think there's realopportunitiesum a couple of steps to get right firstfor us was to build a a framework forresponsible AI use I think that's reallyreally important we worked with OxfordUniversity uh in in the UK we have anumber of phds in Ai and we build aframework and a set of rules ontraceability explainability and what wecould use AI for with confidence todayand what we couldn't use AI for jnai foruh with confidence our current strategyis we see it as a really useful tool tohelppeople do their jobs better so give themthe information that they need to totake away the drudgery of their task andI think that's important because you'realways maintaining the human Connectionin the relationship with your customerand therefore some of the problems wehave with Gen III today hallucinationserrors the prompting capabilities as youcan manage that because you're stillmanaging that in an effective way a goodexample would bein our chat Bots we haveum about 13 and a half millionconversations on our chat Bots acrossall of our markets anywhere between 65and 80 fully automated through thechatbot with no human intervention oneof the problems we have as a business iswork out why those customers called uswhat was the intent when you call acontact center agent we the agent cantick a box to tell us what it is whenit's a digital channel very hard to workout what the particular issues were whatthe intents were as Hamin said the longtail of intense is really expensive toto develop so we took all of thoseinteractions in in our Market we use genAI to summarize those and then use thatto inform us and where we need to makeinvestments and decisions and how we canimprove where do we need to train agentswhere do we need to work on particularfunctions and help to drive performanceacross the business a very safe way todo that we've anonymized the data beforewe give it to the llm to do the the thethe summation and and we're not we'renot exposing that data directly tocustomers I think that's a I thinkcustomer care is a real area of focusthe second problem we had in thebusiness was everyone wants to do gen AII mean everybodyum no one's got your money for it butthey're all really excited about theopportunity so we needed a model to sayhow do we decide where do we want totest and and run cases we're currentlyrunning 60 projects across the businesswe built a a gen AI governance boardit's not run by me it's actually run byour commercial director because wewanted to make sure that everything thatwe did with Gen I had a commercialbenefit not a technology benefit myjob's to build the technology actuallymy team's job to build the technology Ithat make all that happen and then we weset up a set of parameters that wewanted to be successful I'm reallyexcited about what it does fortechnology we we've got a very largebase of software Engineers we see thingslike copilot helping us really improvethe performance of our softwaredevelopers in the speed that they candevelop at we think helping customercare agents with more intelligentinformation summarizing what's in ourour knowledge bases and all of thoseareas important the other thing we'vefound actually our content's not thatgoodso you can ask an llm to summarize itand the answer you get is really crapyou think well the LM is not very goodactually it's not it's the contact thatyou fed it that wasn't very good sothere's a there's a real process to gothrough to to get the business to cleanup their content and make that happen II think generally I will be uhprobably as impactful as the PC andExcel on businesses but I think you needto take careful cautious steps to makesure you're delivering value for surewe're going to go through a hype cyclefor sure people are going to make bigmistakes I'd like to try and contain ourwork to areas where if we do make amistake or if the llm is wrong thatwe've got a governance model around thatwhen we're really really confident thenwe'll share our customer data then we'llshare it directly to customers to drivesome of those use cases we've got morethan enough things to do where we'rehelping our employees be better beforewe need to talk directly to customersthank you Scott I really appreciate youjoining us today thank you thank you[Applause]look it's great to see how customersincluding BT group Vodafone group andmany more partners and customers arereally coming together to unlock thevalue of data Ai and networks to drivenew value for for the customers and theorganizationthank you again hermin and Scott andthank you to all our customers ourpartners and to all of you[Music]foreign"
