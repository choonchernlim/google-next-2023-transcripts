isso great to be back in person this yearmy name is Jun Yang today I'm excited toshare with you what's next withgenerative AI at Google CloudAI is undergoing I'm undergoing a majorshift with the Riser Foundation modelnow you can leverage these Foundationmodels for variety use cases without mlexpertise with little to no trainingdatathis is really a game changer for AI andis significantly accelerating time tovalue for Enterprises to adopt AIwhen it comes to generative AIour goal is to bring the power ofEnterprise ready generative AI to helporganization innovate fasteras Thomas mentioned in the KeynoteGoogle is the only company that offersthe full technology stack from the highperformance AI infrastructure toFoundation models to the tools that usethese models to build custom models andapplication with vertex AIto integrate these generative Kicapability into gcp product with duet AIacross the entire stack we haveIncorporated securityprivacy compliance and control all ofthese requirements the Enterprise needto adopt generative AIif you want to learn more about duet AIplease attend a host of other Spotlightsessions on the talk about how we'rebringing duet AI to Google Cloudproducts to bigquery to workspace andmorein today's session we're going to focuson vertex AIour comprehensive AI platform that helpEnterprises to build AI poweredapplication and servicesduet AI itself is built on vertex AI aswellso we have seen tremendous demand fromour customers on vertex AI since Aprilof this year the number of customersengaging with Google Cloud on generativeAI has grown by 15xour customers are partnersare leveraging generative AI for varietyof use casesas you can see on this slide here wehave a number of customers some of themyou saw a little bit earlier in thekeynote and we're excited to have Bosegitlab and World Bank joining us todayyou'll hear from them just a little bitat Googlewith the rise of generative AI we candemocratize AI far beyond the datascientist enabling a much larger rangeof users like developers and businessusers to take advantage of AIwe understand that based on customersuse cases and technical skills they willconsume generative AI differentlyso we're powering our application likecontact center Ai and document AI withgenerative AI capability to helpbusiness users achieve more valuequickly with new functionality likesummarization accelerated bot buildingand moredevelopers a much larger audienceCanal leverage our powerful Foundationmodels to infuse generative AIcapabilities into their application fortransformative resultsvertex AI combines the foundation modelcapability with search and conversationto allow developers to easily andquickly build chat Bots voice botknowledge search and many many more usecasesAI practitioners like data scientistsand ml Engineers can easily accessFoundation models and the tools neededto tune deploy and monitor these modelsin vertex AI platformand of course everything is built on topof a world-class infrastructureand all of these features are generallyavailable and you can use them todayso we'll get started to talk aboutFoundation model firsta foundation model is a large modelthat's trained on the vast Corpus ofdata it recognizes predicts generateswords images text videos and moreit is capable of doing many tasks out ofthe box with little to no additionaltrainingwe have launched multiple families ofGoogle Foundation models acrossdifferent modalitiesfrom text to code to images to speech toembedding and moreall of these models are now generallyavailable and immediately accessible viavertex AItoday we're excited to announce newversions across several of theseFoundation model familiesstarting with our text and chat modelpalm2many of you have askedhey can you increase the input tokenlength we heard youwith this new version we have increasedthe input token length by four timesfrom 8 000 tokens to 32 000 tokensmaking it easy for you to process longerform documents like research paper legalbriefs books documents and moreyou've also asked for more languagesupportand we're announcing Generalavailability for 38 language todayincluding Arabic Chinese Japanese GermanSpanish and morewe also have 100 more language inprivate previewwe're also launching upgrades to ourtext to image model imagineimagine provides capability such asimage generation editing captioningvisual q a and morewith this version this new version wehave significantly improved the qualityof the generated imageswe're also introducing a very coolfeature style tuning which some of yousaw at our keynote this morningleveraging this feature Enterprise cannow create images aligned to theirspecific brand guideline or othercreative needs with as few as 10reference imagesand style tuning is actually availabletodaycontinuing on the topic of AI generatedimageswe are pleased to be the first cloudprovider to enable digital watermarkingfor generating imagesdigital watermarking on vertex AI ispowered by Google deepmind sense ID astate-of-the-art technology that embedsWatermark directly into the image of thepixelsand making it invisible to the human eyeso it does not damage the quality andit's difficult to removewe're launching digital watermarking inexperimental and are working with aselected set of Partners and customersto learn and refine this capabilitywe have also upgraded Kodiour text to code modelwith this new version customer will seeup to 25 quality improvement in thesupported programming language for codeoperation code chat co-generation andmoreadditionally we're also on announcingthe preview of streaming API for codegeneration and chat which streams themodel output in real time therebyimprove their developers experiencetext a SQL as the name suggests isconverting natural language to SQL allowcustomers on the users who may not befamiliar with SQL to be able to leveragethis power with just plain languagein addition to the base Foundationmodels we're also providing Foundationmodels for industry-specific use caseslike SEC Palm for cyber security domainand medpong for medical domainwe have been working with a small set ofcustomers like Bayer farmer HC HCAHealthcare Medtech and more tounderstand how medpom could be usedbased on the feedback and overwhelmingcustomer demand we're excited to expandthe pre-private preview for medpom nowmore customers can Leverage The Power ofmatpom to unlock new use cases inhealthcarein line with ourcommitment around fostering an openecosystemtoday we're announcing the addition ofmetas Lama 2 and code Lama to our modelGardencodelama was added to vertex AI within48 Hours of its releasereally talking about really kind ofspeaking to the power of the platformhereof course the you know all this thelaunches are done with card EnterpriseReadiness and the security control builtinwe're also pre-announcing the additionof anthropics Cloud 2 to model Gardenwith these additions Google Cloud nowprovides the widest variety of models tochoose than any other hyperscaleproviderwe have our own models we welcome modelsfrom partners and of course we Embraceopen source modelswith access to over a hundred curatingmodels in vertex AIcustomers has a flexibility to pick thebest model for their particular usecaseszooming in on llama2I'm excited to announce that Googlecloud is the only cloud provider thatprovides both adapter tuning andreinforcement learning with humanfeedback for llama 2. this allows theorganization to tune lamatu with theirown Enterprise data while continue tomaintain full control and ownership oftheir datanowI'd like to introduce David de SantoChief product officer from gitlab totalk about how they are leveragingGoogle's Foundation model Cody and palmwelcome David[Applause]thank you for joining us todaythanks Junefor those here who are not familiar withgitlab we are fundamentally changing howdevelopment security and operationsteams work together collaborate andbuild secure softwarefrom planning to coding to building tosecuring to monitoring and deployingwe help organizations build more securesoftware fasterwe're able to do this because we providethe most comprehensive Enterprise DevTech Ops platform delivered as a singleapplicationand now this application is way moreefficient with the use of AII've been meeting with gitlab customersall over the world and they share thesame concerntheir concern is will my software mysource code my intellectual property beusedwithout my consentand I'm sure some of you have the sameconcern as wellthat concern is what led gitlab toDefine our vision for how we will use AIour vision is built on top of three keytenants the first is apply AI across theentire software development lifecyclethis is because even if you made yourdevelopers a hundred times moreeffective something around them willbreakour second is to lead with a privacyfirst approachmeaning that your code stays your codeand we will not use it for training orfine-tuning of modelswe also leave the same way on prior I'msorry we leave the same way ontransparency as wellour goal is to tell you what AI modelswe're using For What and how thosemodels were trainedand finally we want to lead with abest-in-class AI experience meaning thatwe're choosing the right AI model forThe Right Use case this is to help usavoid the whole if my llm is a hammereverything must be a nailso to achieve this Vision we needed theright partner and Google cloud is thatright partnerthis is because Google Cloud shares thesame strong sense of commitment toEnterprise Readiness and privacyand we're thrilled to be working withGoogle Cloud on delivering our visionfor AI powered workflows as part of thesoftware development lifecycletoday we're leveraging poem 2 Foundationmodels including the Kodi model familyto deliver AI powered experiences tousersall involved in creating software thatcan be product managers marketing teamswhoever they are they get the Boost fromAIthis partnership has come fully to lifeand we're able to deliver value to ourcustomers every dayGoogle Cloud's vertex a model Garden hashelped create one of the best outcomesso far and with that I want to introduceyou to get lab Duogilabduo is our suite of AI poweredfeatures that enable users across theentire software development life cyclewith the goal of making everyone 10xmore efficientwith gitlab Duo you have an AI poweredpartner to help you ship more securesoftwaredeploy more effectivelyensure your CI CD pipelines are healthyand make sure you catch vulnerabilitiesbefore they're in productionit's so exciting to see gilab Duo cometo life and help everyone contributemore effectivelyto be to bring this to life we selectedthe right foundation models for each usecase to ensure we're delivering abest-in-class AI experiencefor our users this means that theirteams can now get up to speed muchfaster during planning write better moresecure software more efficientlyget through code review faster and I cantell you that's a big pain point for alot of customers as well as resolvevulnerabilities faster in fact resolvethem before the code is committed andpushed into productionand just like Ai and gitlab all this AIfunctionality is part of the sameunified workflow allowing developmentteams security teams and operationsteams to work more effectively poweredby AInow one of the features I wanted tohighlight for you today is gitlab Duo'scode suggestionsit actually was mentioned in the keynoteearlier today as well Co suggestions isbuilt on top of a palm 2 familyspecifically the coding models to givedevelopers efficiency from suggestingand completing codesuggestions keeps developers in theirFlow by completing lines of codecreating and defining Logic forfunctions generating test cases and somuch morecode suggestion supports 14 languagestoday and is supported on the major Idesthat customers of GitHub use and I'msure a lot of your teams use as wellincluding go Labs web IDEvs code visual studiojetbrains and neovim and we have more tocomeand of course code suggestions is builton top of the same privacy as a criticalfunctionthis means that your source code willnot be used to train the featureand we're excited to be bringing thenewest ad models mentioned this week atnext two code suggestions includingtoday making available the ability to gofrom comment to code within our IDEa we'll have lots more announcementsrelated to the integration of all theother models that are coming outin close I want to share the codesuggestions is actually available rightnow for free to any gitlab userif you're not GitHub user you can go togitlab.com and sign up but it's free ongitlab.com getlab dedicated that's ourself our single tenant SAS offering aswell as gitlab self-managed customerswhile we have the future in beta so Ihighly encourage you to check it out getthe power of Google AI as part of yourgitlab experienceand get the Boost of efficiency ourcustomers are telling us about beingable to get through coding code reviewand applications to planner productionmuch faster and with that thank you alland back to you Junethank you Davidso great to see these capabilities inactionwe have just talked about a number ofadvancements on the foundation model butwe didn't stop therewe ask ourselves while the foundationmodel are powerful capable can we dobetterthe answer is yeswe have developed a set of modelaugmentation tools to augment thecapability of foundation model furtherto make them more useful for Enterpriseslet me highlight a few of them todayEnterprises want Foundation modeloutputs to be factfulgrounding stability to force the modelto provide output that's based on userspecific user-specified Source materialto ensure that responses from Foundationmodels are factual and verifiableextension is a set of tools that helpdevelopers to connect the foundationmodel to real-time information andreal-world actions via apisand finallytuning is ability to be able tocustomize a foundation model with yourEnterprise data to provide more accurateand relevant resultsso let's walk through each one of thesein more detailfirst groundingtoday I'm excited to announce the newgrounding capability in vertex AI inpreviewthis will enable our customer to groundtheir responses on their own Enterprisedataand the best part is that customer cannow enable this integration out of boxwithout any development workso let me show you exampleon this example it shows a genericanswer you would get from a foundationmodel on the question about 401kcontributionnow if we ground the data on yourEnterprise data the response now isaugmented with the company specificinformation about 401K matchinginformation that's sourced from yourEnterprise data now that's much moreuseful for the for your userextensionsextension Powers empowers the developerto easily integrate real-time data andreal-world actions into generative AIpowered applicationwe're excited to announce vertex AIextension in previewvertex AI extension is designed to beEnterprise grade with Enterpriseencryption data control and security outof the boxdevelopers can leverage Google buildextensions for services like bigqueryalloy DB out of the box as well aspartner build extensions from datastacks mongodb redis and moreof course developer can also buildupload test and manage their ownextensionsfor folks who are familiar with thereact framework we're also including theagent support to provide Enterprisegrade orchestration capability withAdvanced logic to make extensions morecapable you see that in just a littlebit in the vertex AI search andconversation areaso just about every Enterprise has alarge repository of data I often getasked how do I tune my data what's thebest method well my response is well itdependsthe best method to use for customizingthe foundation model depends on thespecific task it depends on the type oftraining material you have available andalso depends on your in-house ml skillsetlet me highlight a few options that weoffer and some considerations on one youmight choose one option over the othergoing from left to rightthe tuning message the tuning mechanismgets more sophisticated requiring moredata and generally costs more to tuneso starting with the simplest one promptdesign that's the simplest one this iswhere the user is designing the promptand optionally adding a few examplesthis does not require ml expertise andcan be done directly through the UI orAPIthe second method is adapter tuningwhich requires a bigger training dataset with tens to hundreds of examplesand some more computer trainingthis requires some ml expertisewhat it yields is a adapter model whichis additive to our base modeland together they're able to generatemore customer results for yourEnterprisebecause we clear create a clearseparation between the adapter layer andthe base model adapter model give youthe power of customization whileprotecting your data and IPtoday we're excited to announce thatadapter tuning for text and image isgenerally available and adapter tuningfor chat and code is in previewfor more advanced users we also offerreinforcement learning with humanfeedbackso this allows a user to be able to takethe human feedback on the model outputto tune the model using vertex AIPipelines this technique takes a higherlevel ml skill setbased on strong customer feedback we'reexcited to announce that reinforcementlearning with human feedback is now inpreviewfinallyfull fine tuning which is where the basemodel weights are adjusted to fit themodel for specific use casesthis is a good choice for customers whohave a large amount of training data andadvanced ml practitioners in-housenow you can leverage vertex AI tocustomize selected open source largelanguage models like T5 Bert with fullfine toning capabilitychoice is really at the heart of vertexAI customer can pick the right model theright tuning method the best suit fortheir business needs and business skillsetsnow with all these choices all thesemodels and model augmentation optionscustomers now have a different dilemmawhich is how do I know which model isbest for my use cases how do I knowwhich augmentation method is best usedfor this particular modelso we believe it's imperative to have asystematic way to evaluate the qualityof different models and differentaugmentation toolsat Google Cloud this is something we doday in day out to look at our models anddeciding whether this is the model wewant to put out there for uh for forconsumption so I'm happy to share thatwe're making our model evaluation toolsand framework available to our customerstwo general approaches on the modelevaluation both are supported in vertexAI evaluationthe first approach is automatic metricsthis is where the customers can define atask specific metric for their use casecustomer can then evaluate the modeloutput against the desired output andvertex AI will help determine thequality of the given model candidatethe second approach is automatic side bysidein this scenario customer can use alarge Foundation model sometimesreferred to as a teacher model as aproxy for human evaluator this approachhelps to narrow down and select the mostpromising candidate from the modelfamily quickly for human evaluationwhich in turn help to reduce the boththe cost and the time for evaluationSwitching gears a little bitfor most data scientists the AI workreally starts in a notebookcollab is a notebook that's developed byGoogle research to bring Google doc likecollaboration features to datascientistssince this release in 2017 colab hasbeen adopted widelytoday colab has over 7 million users andtwo-thirds of the Fortune 100 companiesare already using collabso I'm excited to announce the previewof collab Enterprises on vertex AIcollab Enterprise is now the commonnotebook interface across multipleGoogle cloud services vertex Ai bigqueryand morewith collab Enterprise users can now getup and running quickly with zeroconfiguration experiencewe have also added generative AI poweredcode completion and generationcapability to help data scientists to bemore productiveand of course the popular collaborationcapability of collab carries overenabling sharing amongst team members toaccelerate experimentationnow I'd like to invite my colleagueNikita namojashi to the stage to demosome of the latest features and that wehave just talked about over to youNikita[Applause]thank you June today I want to show youhow to use vertex AI to explore andcustomize Foundation models acrossdifferent data modalitieswe'll be using genii Studio whichprovides the simple UI for you tointeract with these modelsif you want to extract real insightsfrom text Data you often need that datato be in some structured format likeJson so that you can store it in adatabase and analyze and process it atscaleso I have saved a prompt to help us dothatI'm going to open up this prompt hereand let's say that I want to analyze abunch of tech specs for a bunch ofdifferent project products instead ofdoing this manually which would take mea bunch of time I can use a largelanguage model to efficiently extractstructured data from text and we canprototype this really quickly in gen AIStudioso let's zoom in on this promptthe first thing we do is instruct themodel to extract the tech specs and thenwe specify that we want this done inJson formatafter that we have a string of text andthis is just a bunch of informationabout the Google pixel 7.there are a few different models I canchoose from including the Palm 32k modelthat June mentioned which allows forlonger document inputs but this is apretty short prompt so we'll just stickwith the standard model for nowand we'll click submitand what we get back from the model isthe key pieces of information have beenextracted as product attributes likeNetwork Ram processor and then theircorresponding values for the pixel phoneentirely in Jsonand with the expanded language supportthat June mentioned we can now promptthe model in a variety of otherlanguagesso now I'm going to open up the sameprompt but this time it's in Spanishso we'll go in and we'll select ourmodeland then we can scroll down and clicksubmitand what you'll see is that the modelrestructures the data as Json again butthis time all of the keys and values arein Spanishso now we've seen a few examples ofgoing from text to text but we canactually go from text to other datatypes like code or image so next let'scheck out Cody which is a text to codemodelI've saved one more prompt for us totest out so I'm going to open up thisprompt right nowwriting Docker files is a pretty commontask for developers and it's somethingthat I can get Cody to help me withwhich as a data scientist it makes mylife a whole lot simplerso I'll zoom in on this prompt again andwe're now instructing the model to writea Docker file for us but this time Ihave some requirements I need thespecific version of python and then Iwant some additional data sciencelibraries installed like Pi torch andtensorflow and numpyto use Kodi all you need to do is makesure that you've selected one of thecode modelsand then we can scroll down and clicksubmitand what we'll get back from the modelis a full development environment readyto goand this environment contains all of thepackages that I need to do data scienceso next I'm going to use Kodi to help mewith actually writing some ml model codeso this time I'll type in a new promptgenerate python code for a pi torchmodel to doclassification oopsI always get a typoall rightusing the mnist data set so if you'reunfamiliar mnist is a standard data setfor benchmarking and tutorials andmachine learning so what we'll get backis a bunch of Pi torch code that we canuse to get us started on our datascience Journeyso to close off there's one last datatype that I want to check out with youwhich is image so let's navigate to TheVision section of gen AI Studio where wecan input text prompts and generatebrand new imagesif we scroll down under style you canselect from a variety of predefinedstyles like sketch photography or evencyberpunk and as June mentioned you canalso tune your own custom Styles as wellso because we know that no machinelearning demo is truly complete if noone mentions kittens or puppies I'mgoing to type in a cute kitten as ourprompt and let's just bump up the numberof results and we're going to generatethese images in the watercolor Styleand what we'll get back from the modelis a variety of images oops I actuallyopened up one a variety of images ofkittens and this distinctive watercolorstyle that we could use for differentvisual assetsso I hope that this shows you how to usevertex AI to explore and customizeFoundation models across different datamodalities and I'm really excited to seewhat you build and with that I will handit back to Junethank you Nikitafor that great demo to Showcase how easyand how quickly the model responds tothe requestso we've talked about the Myriad ofinvestment in advancement we've made tothe foundation models we then talkedabout the various augmentation tools toextend the capability of foundationmodels to make them more useful but wedidn't stop therehaving spoken with hundreds ofEnterprise customers two of the mostfrequently requested use case forgenerative AI is around search and chatapplication like being able to do a q awith your own internal knowledge baselike having a chatbot to be able to helpboth your internal employees or externalcustomers with their requestthis is why we introduced vertex AIsearch and conversationbring in our years of experience inSearch and conversation to complementFoundation models enabling Enterprisesto develop these type of experienceswith easevertex AI search and conversationpreviously known as gen nav Builder isnow generally availablenow if we break down these search andchat use cases we see a common patternwhat we have is that we have an inputfrom the user that can be coming in as aform of a text voice or picturesthen we have orchestration layer thatneeds to understand what is the intentof the user and figure out how best toanswer that and the answer would comefrom different places depending on whatthe question so for example for aquestion like what's your store hoursthe answer would come from a simplewebsite searchfor a question like hey what's thedifference between Roth IRA and Ira theanswer could come from the knowledge ofthe foundation modelfor a question like what's my vacationbalancenow the answer will come from your HRSystem via the extensionthe orchestration layer allowsEnterprises to design the generative AIpowered experience and also guide userdown the desired path for quickestresolutionfinally the output needs to be presentedback to user that can be in the varietyof format whether it's text voice ormultimodal responseso let's take a closer look at vertex AIsearchyou may have seen Google's searchgenerative experiencewith vertex AI search now you can offerthe same experiences to your employeesPartners or customers with built-in lowcode multimodal and multi-termcapabilityvertex vertex AI search applies thestate-of-art information retrieval anddeep retrieval techniques leveragingembedding and so on to in to Enterprisedata out of the box and can be easilyleveraged by customer even with verylimited technical expertisewe search one of the things our customercare most about is really data accuracyand reliabilityso I'm excited to announce that vertexAI search results is also grounded onyour Enterprise data with auditablecitationsnow I'd like to introduce RobinAi and ml platform lead from World Bankto talk about how World Bank is usingand leveraging our vertex AI search toreimagine search and generative AI fromthe Google Cloud side welcome Ramenthank youforeign[Applause]I'm so happy to talk about how the WorldBank has partnered with the Google Cloudas part of the early adopted programparticularly for vertex AI search as youmay all know World Bank is aninternational organization focused ondevelopment and primarily the twin goalsof eliminating or ending extreme povertyand promoting Shad Prosperity these arenoble goals right but to achieve themthey require significant researchanalysis and of course the operationalexpertise given the scale of our workand where we work on and the importanceof elevating the value of every dollarinvested Knowledge Management isabsolutely essential when it comes toknowledgepole and print at the WorldBank our main objective is no differentfrom all of you it's getting the rightinformation to the right people at theright timethe approach we took is also possiblyvery similarinitially we started with investing intaxonomies and tagging our content andquickly starting started hitting thelimitations on themthen keyword search was next and justlike you we've also hit the limitationswith that methodand now the promise of generative AIpowered searchwe are excited of about taking advantageof DPI capabilities from thesefoundational models to reimagine ourEnterprise search and we are workingwith Google Cloud to see how we canincrease the value to our staff with byminimizing the effort they take to findthis informationtoday we spend a significant amount oftime within the bank in content analysissynthesis and generationmoving the needle on these steps withgenerative AI will give us we hopeExplorer exponential benefits we consumelots of information and the analysis isusually focused on a very particulartopic the AI generated summaries withthe power of continued conversation withnatural language would be awesomebecause that'll get us jump started weconsume and we produce so we produce alot of content and if our staff are ableto use Enterprise search to generatesummaries and use that to uh as part ofa zero draft that would be amazingof course we spoke about the power ofconversation at the beginning and theability to have a conversation whereonce you have some information you areable to drill down deeper that would bePriceless because the World Bank has 70years of data which if we tap into itelevates the amount invested indevelopment exponentially and finallythe ability to jump start thesecapabilities with limited to no systemintegration work sounds super positivebecause you've all been in my shoeswheremainstreaming of innovation isabsolutely critical right Innovation isgood but we have to mainstream itour journey with generative AI searchhas just started with summarization asyou can see vertex AI is able to providean AI generated summary based on a verycomplex queryit's a question in natural language andit was able to respond back as anoperational Analyst at the World Bank inmy previous life and I would have had tolook through multiple documents acrossmultiple years across multiple projectsand then looked at each of thesedocuments to generate this informationto summarize this Lessons Learned whichyou can see on the screen not anymorewith vertex AI search not justsummarizing a response it also providescitationsfor all the generated response clearlydemonstrating the grounding on our knowndata that June talked about for theWorld Bank and as with any of UIorganizations this is huge from a trustand verification perspectiveI also get the top results for my queryso that I can dig deeper and then usethat information based on whatever Ineed right pretty much like we do nowfinally the multi-turn searchfunctionality allows me to ask follow-upquestions reduces the time taken foreach of these deep types and takes thetime it takes us from a few weeks to afew hourswe are excited to continue our journeywith Google Cloud to unlock otherpotential gen AI capabilities aroundgeneration and conversation we'll keepyou posted on our progress for now backto you June and thank you for thepartnershipthank you Robin for joining us todayit's great to see the tremendousprogress that we have made togetherso moving on to generative AI poweredconversationwith vertex AI conversation we allowdevelopers to bring all thesecapabilities together to easily buildhuman-like safe and useful chat Bots andvoice Botsnot only can these bod understand theuser's intent and then provide themusers with a personalized answerand then be able to generate multimodalresponses across text audio images theycan also be enabled to supporttransactional capability such as makinga payment or completing an orderso how is that possiblelet's take a lookwith vertex AI conversation developerscan start by easily connecting the botto relevant data sources whether it'syour documents your website or otherthird-party systemsleveraging vertex AI data connectorwith just a few clicks developers cannow get a bot that can converse andanswer questions from their Enterprisedatato supercharge the bot withtransactional capabilities developerscould leverage the extension either bybuild something they build themselves orusing existing ones built either byGoogle over one of our partnersdevelopers can also execute common tasksby just adding pre-built tasks likecheck order status explain Bill and morefinallyif a developer wants more control overhow the bot executes specific importanttasks they can Leverage The Playbookfeature which you saw at the keynotethis morningto be able to specify what they need innatural language step by step withinstructions on how to execute the taskto the bot in the same way you would doto human agent this greatly simplifieshow you build a bot and really we'retalking about 10x reduction in terms oftime to build a bot that's really usefultogetherFoundation models search andconversation offers a quick path tovalue for many many Enterprise use caseswe have seen early adapter building avariety application from travel planningto Food Service to banking assistant towebsite chat Bots realizing measurablegains in business metrics like customersatisfaction employee productivity costsavings and morenow I'd like to invite my colleagueKalyan papathi to the stage the demo howeasy it is for developers to buildamazing generative AI experiences onvertex AI over to you Italia[Applause][Music]thank you June hi everyone so I'm hereto show you how you can build andconfigure a search and conversation appjust like the one Raman showed in a feweasy steps the example I'm going to beusing is searching through knowledge andinternal knowledge basis I'm sure we'veall asked questions like these at somepoint let's get startedso I'm going to start my journey in theGoogle Cloud console as you can all seehereI'm going to select my app type assearchI'm going to keep the advanced featureson because we want to show generative AII'll give my search engine a name mytestsearch engineand I'm going to pick a location forwhere the data should be indexed for nowI'll just pick Global and I'll hitcontinue so that's the first step nowthe second step is to create a new datasource and we want to make this as easyas possible we have out-of-the-boxconnectors to public websites Googlebigquery Google cloud storage and evenrest apisbut we know that data within yourorganization is not all in one system sotoday we're launching out of the boxconnectors to third-party systems we'restarting with jira Salesforce andConfluence and over the next few monthswe'll have many other connectorsfor the demo let me just stick withGoogle Cloud Storageso I'm going to select a Google CloudStorage bucket here I have one setupcalled Enterprise docs next I'm going toclick select I'm going to leave theselection as unstructured documentsbecause I'm showing document searchand then I'll hit continue I'll give thedata store a namemy testdata storethen I'll hit createso that's the second step now the thirdeasy step is to connect your searchengine to this newly created data storeI'm going to select it and hit createand that's it we've got our searchengine connected to our data store nowit can take a few minutes to index thedata so let me switch to an applicationthat I created this morning I'm going togo back to apps I'm going to click theapplication called Next underscoresearchnow we're ready to start testing oursearch engine but before I do that Iwant to show you the data that I'veindexed which is from the same GoogleCloud Storage bucket that I showed youbeforeso in here I've got about 50 documentssomeone health benefits someoneunderstanding your pay stubs Etc justlike you would have within yourEnterprise knowledge basisI'm going to switch to configurationsnow we've got a few different options interms of the user experienceI'm going to pick search with an answerhereI'm going to leave snippets on and thenlet's start searchingand for this let's focus on the righthand side of the screenfor my first search queryI'm looking for vacation policies atsymbol which is the fictional companythat I'm working with so I'm going tosay what is the vacationpolicy at symbolokayso you'll see we get a response butthere's three things here to highlightone just like Google search does you geta set of results of your most relevantsearch resultsthen you also get a nicely summarizedanswer to the question that you've askedright so you get you get someinformation on your vacation policy andthird and probably the most important iswhat you see here in Bracketsnow we know that large language modelshave a tendency to hallucinatewhich is sometimes they can createinformation and the information may befrom outside your data sources so wehave invested heavily in grounding thesellms which means that we're trying tomake sure that the information generatedby these large language models is comingfrom your data sources and we can tracethat information back to these datasources through citations which is whatyou see here in Brackets now thisgrounding in citations is reallyimportant for us to be confident aboutthe output generated by the llmsnow let me switch to a different type ofexperience a conversational one I'mgoing to click search with follow-upsand I'll ask a different questionwhat are the benefitsat symbolright so just like before you'll see aset of top results so this is Googlesearch technology at work on your datawe get a nicely summarized answer justlike before and this answer you'llnotice is a little more conversationalbecause you can use this in aconversational chatbot experiencebut here you can also ask a follow-upand this is the power of

privacy security andcompliance reliability sustainabilitysafety and responsibilitythese pillars are really the Cornerstoneof our approach to Enterprise readinessnow I'd like to highlight a few of theInvestments we've made in this areastarting with data privacythe most important thing to rememberabout data privacy is that your data isyour data let me first Define your datayour data includes the input prompt themodel output the metadata the trainingdata your human evaluation feedback andso forth we believe all of these arepart of your data and your IP we do notuse your data to train our own model soyou can rest assure that you can use ourproduct confidently knowing that yourdata and your IP are protectedmoving on to security and complianceall of our generative AI offering arebuilt on top of Google Cloudinfrastructure with the same highstandard on security protocolsfor vertex AI platform we have recentlylaunched VPC security controlcustomer managed encryption key dataresidency and access transparencythe same control is being rolled out tovertex AI search and conversation in thecoming monthswhen it comes to responsible AIwe have a comprehensive set ofresponsible AI tooling including safetyattributes model evaluation biasevaluation content moderation recitationcheck and more all of these tools toreally help customers to understand andtest their models and thereby reduce therisk of negative or harmful outcome fortheir use caseson this slide it's a good example ofresponsible AI showcasing our capabilityaround safety filterwe classify over 15 harmful categoriesand provides a confidence score so youcan set safety filters with thresholdthat's appropriate for your particularuse caseyou can also set up automatic blocks ifthe threshold is breachedWe are continuing to invest in thisspace and will help our customers usinggenerative AI responsibly andeffectively to transform their businessand finally we're working closely withour partners across the entire stack
