    "transcript": "foreign[Music]hello everyone my name is Laura GrossI'm a security Consulting manager withAccenture and today I'll be yourmoderator for this session today we'regoing to be discussing our partnershipwith Google and what the next generationof cyber security really looks likejoining me todayare two of our Accenture Securityleaders Rob Boyce and Rex dexton Rob isour Global cyber resilience lead and Rexis our Global cyber protection andsecurity technology officertogether Rex and Rob are really truethought leaders and innovators in thespace so I'm really excited to ask someimprove on some questions today aroundthe partnership so without further Adolet's delve into the session we're goingto be discussing our collaborativeExcellence with accenture's partnershipwith Google coupled with theRevolutionary cyber security space ofmxdr and gen AI ushering this really newera of cyber security so without furtherAdo Rex I'll start with you can youprovide an overview of why cybersecurity is currently at an inflectionpoint its implications for our clientsand why it has become such a complexissueyeah I think you know today's world hasbroad security implications and you knowwith weakening Enterprise securityparameters and the expanse of the attacksurface and and the migration to Cloudsecurity has had a hard time keeping upwith you know the different nuances whatworked you know for the last 25 yearsisn't going to work for tomorrow and sowith that you know we're seeing a bigshift in in how we go to market and whatwe're trying to do and that's why ourpartnership with Google is so importantand we'll talk more about that later Ithink the other thing is you know withall the regulations that are coming up alot of our clients are falling into theTrap again where comply you know theythink compliance equals security and Ithink what we're trying to help ourclients do is making sure as they'remeeting their compliance needs are alsostaying secure and that's superimportant in in this world and I thinkyou know the other thing that we've seenis this tool proliferation over the lastyou know eight to ten years we've seenbest of breed and I think you know fromdifferent surveys from Gartner from theanalysts and and other vendors you'resaying most csos have 75 to 80 pluscyber security tools in theirinfrastructure and so we we see thisopportunity as we're seeingconsolidation with vendors Acquisitionsand Tool capabilities especially in thesecurity operations space we're seeingthe ability to provide an end-to-endplatform that can drive meaningfulbusiness outcomes for for security and Ithink that's you know super importantfrom that perspective and then with theyou know escalating pace of Technologychange around you know gen AI you knowwhen we hit RSA I think for those of youhere that's all everybody could talkabout was how Jenny is going to do thishow it's going to do thatum you know solve world hunger and Ithink we're starting to see a lot ofpeople jump onto that bag wagon but it'salso the part about securing it as wellas leveraging it to drive securityoutcomes and we're very focused on bothfrom that perspectiveand then the other piece is you know isthis the step-by-step approach is nolonger valid you know we need a giantleap forward and I think that brings newopportunities from focusing on incidentsto resilience and proactive versusreactive because a lot of the securitymeasures have been in place and I'vebeen doing this a long time have beenvery reactive and we and and now whatwe're trying to do is can we leverageyou know gen AI can we leverage AIfoundational models to drive meaningfulproactive security and I think that'staking a step back from just havingsecurity people look at what AI usecases are available but also looking atyou know broader data scientists andbeing able to drive that and then youknow lastlyum you know security needs to become anintegral part of of the business youknow a lot of times it's a black box thesecurity guys were over here we just dothis and protect but in order to helpour organization scale we need to scalesecurity along with the business driversand business outcomes and I think thisneeds to be more upfront and Center inthe business conversation because a lotof our clients have slowed their theirmigrations enough to cloud or differentthings because they couldn't make makesure they were going to be secure and soit's super simple super important thatwe frame security as a key businessdriver and a key business issue and haveeverything you know security by Designin itI think if I could just maybe add alittle bit to that I don't know how butI'll do my bestthe uh I mean for me the fundamentals ofsecurity have not changed at least in 25years since I've been doing this we takethe same approach over and over weaggregate data we look for threats wetry and find anomalies and then werespond very reactive as Rex said and Ithink we need to instill a new way ofthinking and we need to make some keypivots in the way we the way we approachthis problem you know I think two twoways to me and they apply very much towhat we're doing with Google one is weneed to look at data differently I thinkit's a security Community we haven'teven began to ask the right questions ofour data again it's been very threatfocused so I think we need to move fromthis concept of threat data to all dataand we need to start thinking about howto leverage different types of data tohelp us make better business andsecurity decisions I think what we sawin the Russia Ukraine conflict is aninteresting example thinking about howto use causation from geopoliticalevents to start predicting where we'reseeing threat actors operate in in youknow at least in this case in thewestern world that was outside of theconflict Zone and I say I think we wereable to start thinking about you knowleveraging that data and applying it toto our ecosystem and security that wayand also with the supply chain so thatshowed us things that we didn't reallyexpect that we'd have to deal with froma supply chain perspective and so Ithink if we start just digging into Databetter I think we need to start askingbetter questions and using more datathan just threat data so I think that'sone big area I think another area thatwe can really uh pivot to is we have youknow security people uh cannot solve thesecurity problem we have proven thatagain at least in 25 years and I thinkit's because we're not creating enoughdiversity of a cognitive diversitywithin the workforce and so we're stillrecruiting people from stem programs andI think we you know need to think abouthow to enable additional people from adifferent backgrounds to be able to getinto the security space to help us thinkabout this challenge differently andagain I think because of the you knowthe disruptive Technologies with Gen AII think we're going to be able to dothat in a much more mean away than wehave been able to do in the past yeah nothat's a really good point thank youboth uh for sharing Rex at a high levelhow are we as Accenture and Google goingto really move the needle in cybersecurityyeah I think you know when we werelooking for you knowyou know how we were going to change thesecurity Market we met with you knowSunil potty I think some of you seenthem but you know their Vision hisvision and and their you know Google'svision for how they're going to takesecurity forward you know aligned withour vision right we needed a step changeit's not security for today but it'swhat it's going to be tomorrow and youknow you know we were super excitedabout that opportunity and and we bothhad the commitment in propelling thisproactive measures and reshaping thesecurity of I mean the trajectory ofsecurity I think if you look at it welook at it this way we have you knowwe're the largest security servicesprovider in the world right you know wehave they have the number one securitybrand in the world with Mandy and thatthey bought they're committed to beingyou know top you know one of the topsecurity software providers in the worldif we can combine these forces we candrive the market in the more meaningfulchange and and drive that vision of ofnext-gen security I think you know andand with that you know we had the eyetowards the future and you know part ofthis thing we're going to show you latertoday is some of the things that we'vebeen doing working with them on on theset palm security workbench from a genAI piece which is which is superexciting and and we see huge hope thatthis is going to drive us and you knowit's about protecting the criticalassets right at the end of the day youknow making sure that we can drive thesecurity strengths but it's acollaboration I think that's made it aspecial relationship you know I see someof the googlers in here and and we'vehad a great collaboration in in withproduct management and working with themand and driving what what capabilitiesand what needs to be in the future thatwe truly believe you know if if you wantto go with the same little same old youknow there's plenty of vendors out thereto do that but it's what what's we'relooking you know the forward-lookingaspect of what we're doing in in drivingyou know product and what we feelsecurity should be is Rob you know soeloquently spoke about earlier thatthat's where we're headed and that's whywe're super excited about thispartnership and and we're seeing greatresults I mean just you know since welaunched you know formally before RSAwe've had you know great results we'redriving great outcomes for clients andit's just been it's been great fun sofardefinitely thank you Rex sharing thatVision Rob to you what does that reallymean tactically as a partnershipyeah there's a number of key areas thatwe're focusing on Rex talked about mxdrand you will get to see a little videoof some of the collaboration we havewith Google in that space But this to meagain going back to the data problem Idon't know a better data analyticscompany really than Google so I'm reallyexcited about how we can use the uh youknow use the Google platform to be ableto get better insights out of the dataand make better decisions so this is allgoing to be embedded as part of the mxdrcomponent but if I don't mention thefact and Rex already mentioned likemandians like if we don't take advantageof that in our partnership we're crazyand so I think there's a really greatopportunity for us to do a few uniquethings with mandian and that is you knowwhen we see organizations havedestructive cyber attacks they have tohave an element of not just theinvestigation but also the crisismanagement you know helping prioritizewhat needs to be rebuilt first and thenof course actually doing the recoveryand there's not really a betterpartnership to be able to do thatbecause at Accenture we have people whoknow every platform every applicationand we've built half of them probably sothere's not really a better way to beingable to Leverage The Amazing IRcapabilities of of Mandy and coupledwith you know the recovery capabilitiesof Accenture and then the last area Iwant to mention is is uh cyberintelligence so again going back to dataI don't think uh there's probably abetter company that has better insightsinto what's happening in the world froma from a cyber threat perspective thanmandians and so we're going to be bakingall of those capabilities directly intomxdr so that we're taking advantage ofnot just the you know the globalvisibility we have across all ourmanaged service clients but also whatmandians bringing to the table so we'recombining as Rex said two huge forces tobe able to provide better identificationof threats for for our clients and thenof course better action on those as wellyeahso let's dig inuh adaptive mxdr versus the traditionalmxdr yeah so actually we're going to bedoing uh two things which I think is abit unique so we will have well we'recalling at least a full stack mxdr thatruns fully 100 within the Googleecosystem and I think that's going to bereally provide special opportunities fororganizations to take advantage of theGoogle Investments around AI through thesecurity AI workbench as well as theother Investments again through Mandiand we'll start seeing more and morecapabilities being delivered throughthat platform whether it's you knowvalidation of the efficacy of detectionrules within the platform or againwhether it's being able to understandyou know leveraging the breach analyticsfrom from Global client base but we'realso going to be developing what we'recalling adaptive mxdr and the key hereis we know that organizations everyorganization has a SIM of some kind andthey've made a huge investment in thatalready and so what we what we don'twant to have to do is make them do a ripand replace across their entireecosystem to to have to do a large salechange because it can be a bit risky andit's also quite expensive and so we'regoing to be creating essentially anorchestration layer in the Googleecosystem that will allow us to be ableto have organizations continue to usedifferent Sims that they have today andorchestrate consistently across that andso this is what we're calling againadaptive because we want to make surethat we can continue to pump in the whatwe're learning from our broaderrelationship to build IP within thatorchestration layer continue to buildthe AI components within thatorchestration layer and apply it acrossa company's ecosystem equallydefinitelysession unless we've really talked aboutgen AI so I would love to get into thevery hot topic of gen AI Rex how are weseeing gen AI as a real game changer incyber yeah I mean if you look at justfrom just in the security space you knowwe immediately set up a a Coe to see ifwe could drive and we've came up with Ibelieve over 70 use cases we justlaunched a contest out to all ourpractitioners and came up with 260submissions but we focused on on ahandful to get started that could beactionable and tangibleand and you know what you'll see todayis what we're doing with mxtr at ourbooth there's another demo around Cloudsecurity where we can come in and andand and speak to an llm and ask how tomeet a a California privacy regulationand then go out and actually generateyou know leveraging code by son LMgenerate IAC Securities code and policyas code and and automate a lot of thesefunctions so we're you know we'relooking at ways to to drive automationfrom that perspective and you know froma cyber security perspective we see itas the you know the biggest opportunityand the biggest risk right and so youknow half of our conversations are arefocused around around securing AI Ithink there's I don't know Scott'ssitting here in the front row butthere's probably five to ten a weekgoing on with clients around the worldand on how do we protect this you knowsecure enclaves and these types ofthings and when we had our cybersecurity form CSO cyber security Forumwhich we have about 200 ceases that siton everybody talked about governance theright to have making sure they have theright technical controls and governancearound everybody was concerned aboutthat and so I think as the space evolvesyou know what we need to do is not berigid in our governance models but bemore agile and adapt to how we're goingto see it and I think the other thingthat we're seeing you know our focus onon that is it's around working with whatwe'd call trusted AI sources righttrusted llms like you know SEC palm andand others but it's critical because theTelemetry and data is the key as Rob hasbrought up and so it's super importantthat you can you know when you're doingyour prompt engineering and driving thatyou're going against a data set that hasyou know the widest array of telemetryand I think you know that's what we'reso excited about SEC Palm it's what 80of the internet all the Mandate andTelemetry you know virus total Etc it'sa great set and if you can train itproperly you can get a lot of meaningfulresults around that and I think you knowwe also did a survey of over uh 5 000Executives in one of our Accenturesurveys and we found that 98 of ourfolks haven't you know of clients havean interest in using generative AI insome form or fashion but the the ironicthing was out of that only six percenthad a plan for responsible Ai and sothat was that was quite fascinating butI think that's you know super importantto be focused on you know making sureyou're you know using AI responsibly andsecurely and then you know the otheraspect of that research was that 40 ofall working hours across all Industriesincluding cyber security will have areduction in in hours you know yearsfrom that so the automation capabilitiesare are significant and tangibleyeah definitely that's a really reallyinsightful Rob where have you seen genAI been applied in cyber so faryeah that's a great question so I thinkI feel like we're in a bit of an armsrace to prove where you know Jenny isgoing to have the most tangible outcomesI think everyone got I think this isprobably in my view the third AI wavethat we've lived through but this onefeels more real right um I think becausegen AI just showed us that you know ityou can feel it you can touch it so Ithink there's there's a few areas uh forme that we're doing some research on asRex mentioned we identified 70 use casesvery quickly across various areas ofsecurity including Cloud privacy andregulation of course security operationsbut the three that are getting me reallyexcited one is around cyber intelligenceso again going back to data big surprisebut doing this a little bit differentlyso like obviously you can apply gen AIto be able to createum you know threat reports faster fromyour trusted threat data but I think wecan go a step further and start thinkingabout the world of data even larger sothinking about how we can use the llmsespecially within Seth Palm to be ableto start getting more of that publicfacing higher Fidelity threat datamarrying it with the data that you knowsomeone like Accenture has through ouryou know 1200 managed service clientsand we're seeing that type of those typeof Trends but then also with with thedata that resides in the clientenvironment and this is what's mostimportant because you know we we feelthat it's it's very very important to bebuilding theseum these models in actual environmentswith clients for us to build it in theback and then try and bring it to aclient it's not going to necessarily bethe best idea we need to make sure thatwe're leveraging the data that existsbecause this is not something you cancreate fake data on and then try andapply models and hope for the best andplaying it from organization toorganization we have to do it with thedata that exists so I think that's aunique opportunity for us to be able toidentify a number of design Partnerswhich Rex has mentioned and we have andwe're applying a lot of these differentuse cases another area that is isexciting to me at least is in theconcept of exposure management I thinkwe have again in 25 years at least in myexperience have not solved the simpleproblem of patching right we have notbeen able to solve that and that's justfrom vulnerability scanning data when wethink about exposure management we haveto include vulnerability data we have toincludeum you know attack service managementfrom outside we have to include APISecurity application security we have tolook at the exposure footprint muchbroader than we are today and how are wegoing to be able to help prioritize theremediation of those uh different uhvulnerabilities or different exposureswe're going to have to use some type ofAI technology to help us do that withinthe context of the organization and Ithink that's what's really key rightit's it's not just being able toleverage the threat data that exists andthe cve scoring but really being able tounderstand the business context of anorganization to help prioritize thoseexposure remediations and I think that'sgoing to be a really interesting areaand then of courseum security operations and so againwe're going to show an interesting videowhere we've already been doing somecollaboration with Google in this spaceand I think this is going to reallyreally help Drive differentiation in acouple of ways we we I think was maybe10 years ago we had hoped that the soartechnology would fix this level oneproblem and we found very quickly thatthere was a dependency on having verystructured processes that alreadyexisted that we could automate throughsoar and I think the with with AI andgen AI we're going to be able toidentify those processes much faster todo automation much faster so I thinkthat's going to be interesting of coursebeing able to produce reports that arehuman readable about the after actionsand and also doing continual learning aswe go through it I think it's going tobe really exciting when we can dosupervised machine learning on analystsso that we can predict how they shouldbe responding and provide them advice onhow to respond to to events based onpast history I think there's so muchopportunity in a security operationsspace to really create a huge impact andthat's been such a sore spot for us as acommunity for so long so I think that'sgoing to be really interesting as welldefinitelycompletely agreepivot a bit to discussing how BusinessLeaders can really ensure that their AIstrategies are secure and beingresponsibly used yeah thanks Laura thisis an important topic as you knoworganizations should be focused onwhether or not to use it but you know befocused on how to use it in the rightway and I think there was an interestingquote from Max tegmark who was a anauthor an MIT Professor he compares thethe risk of AI the risk associated withAI to fire so you know in the in thewinter you can warm your house with firefor good and and and you can also burnit down with fire so you know it's adouble-edged sword so to speakso with that in mind you know obviouslycreating a governance framework is is animportant first stepI think you know leaders must you knowthe key thing here is is focusing onsecurity by Design right or embeddedsecurity and controls we know withinAccenture our CEO mandates it to usright is make sure that everything we dois secure by Design you know whetherit's Cloud migration et cetera and thesame thing has to happen with with GenAi and we need to make sure that we'redoing that by securing the data thephysical systems and the tools that areused and there's a lot of interestingaspects to that because if you look atit you know the the models are fed withdata and is that data secure where isthe data lineage that's feeding thesemodels is it is it Pi are you puttingyourself out to data exposures peopleaccess the state of there's a lot to tothink about from there and I thinkthere's another interesting point andone thing we learned pretty fast is youknow we designed you know these you knowwe are you know came up with these 70initial use cases one is make sureyou're not you know Reinventing the willright so we've been very focused oncollaborating with with our partners andespecially Google and making surebecause when we went through the initiallist they said oh we're doing thesethese already so okay we'll we'll we'llwe'll focus on either addingcomplimentary pieces to it or taking ita step further because I think you canget super excited and your investmentyou know could be short-lived becausethe you know the product vendors couldbe coming out with these these cases youknow you know pretty quickly so it'strying to understand what's in the roadmap where it's going and where you'regoing to get the most bang for your buckis is super important and then you knowfrom a responsible layout perspectiveyou know if if you follow our TechVisions they've been out for severalyears and I think that we've beentalking about it for probably the lastsix or seven years but it but it's superimportant to have responsible Ai and Ithink the other thing you know Robmentioned about you know you knowinclusive diverse and inclusive sets ofinputs it's super important to createbias in your models and I think you knowa lot of like that there was one 1ammodel example was used that it wouldliterally you know look at all thehiring of the last you know 30 years andit turned out to be that every time theykept looking for running their AI to getresumes it was 30 you know 30 year oldwhite males that were that were gettingthat and so there's there's inherentbias within that so it's making surethat you you're driving the right setwithin your models and Frameworks andand leveraging technologies that canhelp you guide your your AI programsforward with trust you know security andprivacy you know those are the importantthings I think a good governanceframework around that will be superimportant and then making sure youunderstand the technical controls andwhere your data is going there's a lotof neat vendors out there that are doingmodel Discovery because what you'll findthe other thing is there's going to be aboatload of of shadow shadow AI runningaround your company because people canaccess chat GPT and looking to be ableto you know check your network Telemetryto see what's going on going outboundand making sure people aren't goingrogue on you I think that's going to besuper important as well absolutely thoseare all really critical items Rob fromyour perspective what are some veryspecific things that Executives canstart doing now for Gen AI securityacross their businessyeah I guess a couple things I'd mentionand Rex alluded to this this is notsomething you need I mean you do need toprepare for but you also need tounderstand this is already happening inyour environment it's likethere's already risks inherently inplace because people may not understandthe the governance that needs to be putin place to really Safeguard this so thefirst thing I would say is you need tocreate that governance structure rightyou need to be working with stakeholdersacross the organization to reallyunderstand where we are going to focusthese use cases how we want to use thisresponsibly how do we protect ourselveswhat is you know what is the data thatwe you know we want to be able to to theor the value we want to be able to getout of this so I think that that'sreally really super importantthe next part I would say is you knowyou need to train your staff now and notnecessarily train them in how to be AIexperts but train them in understandingthe risks associated with what they'redoing because the last thing you want issomeone to be using open source chat GPTto be leaking out IP and we've alreadyseen this in many instances with somevery large companies that have beenannounced publicly that they have lostIP through chat GPT because of bestintentions in the workforce butunfortunately it caused the loss of Ipso I think we we need to make sure thatwe're training employees appropriatelyand then I think the the other thing isyou need to understand the risks likeRex sort of talked a little bit about wehave to train the models in an unbiasedway so we have to think about this withdifferent points of view again it can'tbe security people only training thesemodels we need to be thinkingdifferently about how we introduce thethe or eliminate the bias around thetraining of the models that's going tobe super uh important but I think wealso need to think about the securityrisks associated with those and so weneed to be as we're training thesemodels we need to be introducing thosesecurity exposures into the modelsbecause we have seen my Intel team isconstantly seeing chatter on the darkweb around how toum you know what what types of exposuresor what types of ways can we compromisemodels that exist and we've already seena number of different successful attacksthrough through the models that existtoday and so just understanding what thedifferent attack vectors that you needto start thinking about protectingyourself from and also making sure thatthose are being put into the trainingprocess so the models could understandwhen they may be being attacked versuswhen it's legitimate activity I thinkthat's going to be something that'sgoing to be super important for yeahdefinitely I completely agree somethingI'd really like to learn more about ordig into is around Workforce resiliencywhat type of skills for generative AIare really required for use cases andsecurity such as security operationslike how is that shifting with Jenaifor me yes so the I think there's firstof all when I think about Workforceresiliency I don't think organizationsreally understand the importance oftheir Workforce and how it contributesto True resiliency within anorganization so when we think aboutresiliency generally we're alwaysthinking about the ability to recoverfrom a disaster or the ability to detectsomething and respond to it quickly buta lot of that is predicated on theskills of the organization the peoplewho are executing it we're never goingto be able to rely on robots or AI to dothe entire security job and so I justencourage organizations to first of allthink about their Workforce is trulypart of that resiliency chain and makesure that the right training the rightcareer path all of that is built in sothat's number one I think as far as genAI though what I'm personally superexcited about is the ability for peoplethat are coming from non-traditional youknowcomputer science or science backgroundsto be able to get introduced intosecurity again to help us thinkdifferently about how to solve thisproblem I think the security operationscenter is one of my favorite examplesbecause right now even level oneanalysts have to be super technical tobe able to operate these 75 to 100different tools that exist within anEnterprise and what I'm hoping we'regoing to start seeing is a less of aReliance on that techno technicalcompetency and that start to shift tomore critical thinking have them bealmost more like detectives and askingthe right questions what what shouldthey be thinking about is almost more ofa traditional intelligence backgroundwhat what do we what questions do weneed to be asking from this data andthen have the AI or have the technologybe able to automate itself and be ableto give the information back to analystsso again they can ask the next questionor they can make the next step and Ithink that's going to be somethingthat's truly going to be fascinating I Iactually I'm gonna I personally predictthat we're going to see a lot lesstechnical people in a sock in the futureuh and a lot more detectives I guess orcritical thinkers I think that's goingto be super fascinating yeah for sureand just to add on I think you know aswe focus on building our Workforce forsecurity I think we have 19 000 SecurityProfessionals and we still at any giventime have several hundred open rolls ofpeople that we can't fill and there'snot enough Security Professionals in theworld to to accommodate this so thepromise of this is is super promising ifwe can automate a lot of you know we'llshow you today some of the Redundanttasks and reduce the time you know timethat they spend on these taskssignificantly you know we should be ableto you know like we said have a moreresilient Workforce and leverage that Ithink the other exciting thing is youknowthe one thing we're great at security isproviding a lot of data and and a lot ofdashboards and and even you know in indata security and all these things youget tons of visibility we've had greatvisibility over these years but what dowe do with that visibility and I thinkthe promise of this is being able totrain off of that and actually action itbecause everything we're focused aroundis is not only just you know from avisibility perspective but but actuallyactioning it and automating theactioning of it because that I thinkwill help our clients scale theirSecurity Programs significantly becauseI think the biggest problem everybody'sgood at getting the base controls forsecurity in but then when you want tomigrate a thousand workloads either youroperations cost Skyrocket or you don'thave enough people so you slow it downand I think that's kind of you know alsothe promise of this from a Workforceresiliency perspectiveyeah may I add one more I guess yeahthank you I I think uh I mean just againbuilding on what Rex was saying I thinkI think the the ability to automate isgoing to be amazing and of course whenpeople are here now ai and automationthey always think well I'm going to losemy job and obviously that's not thepoint because of the deficiency or thedeficit and skilled people we're goingto be able to redirect people to thesemore important roles that need to bedone and I think that that's that'sgoing to beum a huge benefit of of what I think AIis going to bringum to the table as well yeah no that'sdefinitely something to really lookforward to thank you both for yourperspectives on that so getting moreback into the the actual partnershipwith Google what are some specifics onwhat that expanded partnership lookslike with Google rub uh well veryexciting we have a video to show you ina few minutes to set the video up alittle bit we have been developing anumber again going back to those usecases a number of different use caseswithin the security operations spacewithin the security AI workbench and sowe're going to show you one example nowin a few minutes actually you know whatif maybe instead of me talking I thinkthe video is probably better can we

so he can review edit and sharewith his client meanwhile Morgan hasspent the larger portion of the daymanually creating an incident reportokay this is done can you give mefeedback the AI assistant will look atits chat history and incident metadataSam receives real-time feedback whileMorgan will not get feedback until ameeting later in the weekutilizing the security AI assistant Samwas able to accurately escalate theincident create an incident report andreceive critical feedback in minutes fora security analyst without the securityAI assistant this would take hoursit's just one analyst story at scale anorganization would benefit from 80 to 90Time Savings allowing analysts to focuson important and critical tasksforeignI think the one of the things we did wasthis this is actually working in realbut if we just did it online it would bepretty boring right but so we tried toput a story around it to show the timesavings and whatnot but I'll let Robcontinue but now we're super excitedabout it and I think Jonathan who did itis in here actually in this team sosuper excited yeah again I think I'vespent too much of my life in thesecurity operations space to nothopefully make an impact by the time bythe time I'm finished so I think this iswhy I'm really excited about this Ithink there's really a lot ofopportunity the the this was built ontop of course on what Google has beencreating as part of the the foundationfor allowing us to do this and we'rereally focused on creating the contentand the context around the detectionresponse all of that aspect I think herea few things I find really awesome uhwere the the real-time feedback quitehonestly like this is something that wedon't do enough of for uh for stockanalysts like did you respond well didyou not respond well in in this in thevideo even like a week later she mightfind out I'm not sure you ever find outquite honestly so if you're able to getreal-time feedback around how youresponded what you did right what youdid wrong I think it's super interestingfrom a person perspective but we're alsoable to give the models feedback as welland make adjustments to them based onthe actions of the people so I thinkjust being able to have that continualImprovement constant continualImprovement in the security operationscenter is going to be a game changerjust for that capability absolutely andit's great to just see it in action tooyeah go ahead I was going to add and youknow the collaboration on this is youknow didn't we didn't just send someprompts over and worked you know we weworked very closely with the Google teamyou know I think it was a set of 150plus prompts that we did and didretraining on until we got the efficacyto a point you know where we were 100confident in the models and so I thinkthat collaboration is super exciting forus and the ability to help you knowdrive that yeah absolutely very excitingthank youum so we'd like to open the floor up forquestions if there are any please juststate your name the company you'reassociated with and your questionit looks like you get the dance Rob yeahthat's the that's the alternative guysif you don't ask a question then I'vegot a dance so and it's not gonna begreat yeah thank you you didn't want tosee thatmy name is I work for a small companycalled Ellipsis Health we are actuallyyou know also working with Accenture andcurrently filling out the securityquestionnaire so I thought I will attendhereso the last comment that you made aboutyou know this AI assistant about youknow Auto generating the report andthings like thatis that available to like a larger youknow cloudyou know who use you know Google GoogleCloud as a as a platform or is this onlyavailable if you know somebody becomeslike a New York customer and is thereany plan to also you know open this asan open sourceyeah I think so right now it's and withour our mxdr platform but it'll workwith either you know the the full stacksolution or or the hybrid solution fromthat perspective and it is based off ofcurrently you know based off of you knowthe you know SEC palm and and and andthe security workbench so yeah right nowit's very Google Centric but like I saidyou know we're making a big bet withwith the Google security operationsstack and and yeah in theory over timeit'll work you know if there's anotherunderlying back-end like you know Splunkand why not it can it it could eveneventually work with that but our firstFocus was was getting it you know tiedinto our our full stack mxdr so we canget productivity out of our our sockanalysts and scale and then we rolled itout to the hybrid model and then we'llcontinue to to roll it out and enhanceit over time that makes sensegreat thank you for the questionthank youhi my name's Nick I'm from Google workin Australiaum just a couple of questions one on themxtr solution has that been rolled outto customers already or is it beingtrialled and as a follow-up to that isthe plan that all of the Sanchez mxdrSolutions will be built on Googlesecurity technology thanks well it'sbeing rolled out to the guy sitting twoseats over for meright now as we speak but Leo but nowyeah actually one of our customers inAustralia has one of the firstdevelopment design partners for the fullstack mxdr but we rolled out the hybridversion to probably half dozen dozenclients over the lastthree months from from that from thatperspective butum our full stack mxdr platform is is wechose Google because we felt our Visionswere aligned and and where we wereheaded and where we wanted to go withthe security Marketplace so that that'swhere we're heading that's our BET rightnow and I would just to answer thesecond half of your questionum we we want to push as manyorganizations to use the full stack mxdrbecause I think they're going to get themost value out of that but even whenthey still consist they want to maintaina Splunk or a sentinel or whatever isthe back end that adaptive layer that Ihad talked about will be able to stilloperate that and offer that regardlessso we're hoping that all I would saywe're hoping that all of our clients andMSS clients in the future will be Googlecustomers in some way or fashion throughour adaptiveresponse capabilitywe might have time for one more yeahyeahhi Paul Suarez I'm the CSO for Casey's aconvenience store chain in the midwestRobert you had mentioned you only getsavings if you will from soar if yourprocesses are well definedhow well defined do you mean and ifwe've moved to Chronicle and I haveplans ongaining value from soar how much timeshould I expect before I really start tosee that yeah that's a great question Ithink this was one of the earlymisconceptions that you can deploy soarand you can automate all your level oneactivities what we found is mostsecurity operations centers had a10-step process to do a response but inreality when you program a sword youhave to think about it step by step sothat 10-step process became an 80-stepprocess and and so the foundation ofprocess engineering that needed to beput in place was fairly significant butI think by leveraging the AIcapabilities we're going to be able tostart to being able to create thoseprocesses much faster so the valuegetting out of a store should be fasterthan what we've experienced in the pastmost organizations who bought a soreimplemented one use case and that usecase was phishing almost every singletime and then they found out wow thatwas hard maybe we're not going to focuson this but I think again because of theAI capabilities I think we're going tobe able to do it a lot faster so youknow I'm really excited again becausethis space is so close to my heart forso long I I think we're going to be ableto make a huge impact in the securityoperations spaceright"
