today'scontent we do want to create a sharedunderstanding a shared language and layout a few definitions so that you and usmight be on the same page together sofirst the intention of this conversationtoday is to begin by designing a companyculture of belonging for disabledemployees and their allies and unlockingthe potential to build a more inclusiveand accessible worldthat shared understanding is Guided byan understanding of what the wordsdisability and accessibility mean aswell as a few Associated thingsso throughout our conversation today wewill use the word disability in threecontexts first disability as a diagnosisthe medical model of disabilitysecond disability as a disabling set ofinteractions between person andenvironment which is the social model ofdisabilityand finally as a cultural identity oftenrepresented by a capital D which you'llsee throughout our slides todaydisability inclusion therefore is thepractice of ensuring an equitable andexcellent experience for people with anykind of disabilitiesand accessibility is an important aspectof disability inclusion it is thepractice of making informationactivities and or environments sensiblemeaningful and usable for as manydisabled people as possiblenow why does all of this matterfirst and most critically disabledrights are human rightsas while there are more than one billiondisabled people globally and this impactis magnet it's massive what isincremental for others is 10x fordisabled users like usover to Aubry for a conversation on whatthis means for your employeesum

customers and I wantto start by anchoring on one simpletruth if your employees do not feelincluded and if your employees do nothave an accessible workplace it is notyet the time to turn towards yourcustomers however if it is time here aresome actions that you can take and Iwant to start with a reminder thatdisability only becomes a tragedy whenSociety fails to provide the thingsneeded to lead one's daily lifeconsider for a moment have you ever hadto make a phone call to solve a customerservice problema recent experience that I had reallyhighlights the impact of dual paths thatare not treated the sameso recently I had booked a trip to goawayand the company had a Black Friday salethree or four months after I booked thetrip they made it very clear in theirpromotions that if customers who hadpreviously booked a trip contacted themthey could take advantage of the BlackFriday pricing for me this meantthousands of dollars in savings for thistrip that I was planning to takethey had two paths to contact customersupport via phone and via emailphone was not accessible for me so Ireached out to them via email I includedmy trip information confirmation numberthe current pricing as seen in thepromotion and had done the math for themtoo on just how much I believed the costsavings wasshould be pretty straightforwardit took over a month to receive a replyvia email at which time the promotionwas over not to mention the email replydirected me to reach out to customerservice via phone and to be frankchastised me for having not having donesothis to the company seems like no bigdeal two Paths of customer support oneis faster one is slower it is what it isfor me this meant thousands of dollarsthat folks who were able to make a phonecall could take advantage of in savingsbut I could notthere are a number of customer serviceexperiences and broader company customerfacing experiences that are inaccessiblein similar ways it's not just phonecallsin-store experiences include the ofteninaccessibility of checkout linesproduct testing have you ever been in anelectronics store and tested a speakerthose speakers are capped at 70 of theirmaximum sound which sounds great intheory but if you have sensory concernseven 70 percent in an unenclosed spaceis a lot of noisefitting rooms and even the aisles in astore if you've ever been in a storewhen they're restocking their shelves inthe product to be restocked is in thecenter of the aisle that aisle is prettyhard to navigateas well Airline boarding is a greatexample of inaccessible experiencesbetween the experience of waiting inline the multiple points of failure thatwheelchair transfers experience andsunflower lanyards which we will comeback tofinally online tools many online toolshave overly complicated onboarding flowsthey are not just discouraging but alsooften inaccessibleburied accessibility tools so an onlinetool might have accessibility tools butthey are hard or unobvious to find orinaccessible customer support as in theexample I sharedso how do we evolve these experienceshow can we build for all usersespecially disabled usersfirst start by building for everydisabled person we must be comprehensivein creating access it is not enough tocreate a tool that tool needs to bebroadly accessible easily usable andeasily understoodyou must value disabled users feedbackand compensate for their time Aubrytalked about the advocacy labor tax ifyou're going to ask disabled users forfeedback or if a disabled user bringsyou feedback that you want to learn moreabout compensate for that timeand what is incremental for others is10x for us it is a massive impact tobuild this wayas well Solutions Aren't Enough let's goback to those sunflower lanyards for amoment if you're unfamiliar thesunflower lanyard program started a fewyears ago and offers a green lanyardwith bright yellow sunflowers that youcan get at any airport information deskacross the country and around the globethe intention of these lanyards is toprovide an indicator that the personwearing the lanyard has a hidden orvisible disabilitythe purpose of the lanyard is forairport and Airline staff to see thelanyard and immediately be aware thatthis individual may need support and tonot question their presence in placeshoweverif training is not comprehensive ifmessaging is unclear if training is notprovided in an ongoing basis theexperience faltersso if you've provided the messagingabout the sunflower lanyards to Airlineemployees and Airport employees one timethose folks are aware however dependenton labor turnover who's working on agiven day not everyone might know andthen you have the experience of anindividual with a hidden disabilitystanding in line waiting to pre-boardwearing their sunflower lanyard andbeing interrogated about their presencein that line because they otherwise lookvisibly able-bodied it is the continuityof the messaging in the follow-throughand follow up here that creates moreaccessible and inclusive experiencesa layer on top of this is executivesponsorship it is not enough for anexecutive to throw their weight behindthe launch of a programexecutive support is required toreaffirm commitment and importance ofprograms on an ongoing basis internaland external initiatives Need ExecutiveChampions not just for impact but alsofor follow throughso if you are an executive what actionsmight you takeFirst Take visible action and makepublicly available commitments examplesof this include the Google annualdiversity report and the 15 pledgecommit dollars not just words executivesponsorship with words Is frequent andhelpful but making meaningful headcountbudget product development and similarcommitments to disability andaccessibility work go a lot furtherand finally follow up on commitments andinitiatives by checking in you aresignaling to your employees that this isnot a one-time activity if employeesknow that an executive is going to befollowing up they are more likely tofollow through on the work as wellover to Aubrey for key lessons foreveryoneyeah oh I completely nothing more thanone for onething isan excellent experienceforeignforeign"
