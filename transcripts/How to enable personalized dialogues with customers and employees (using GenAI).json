    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good afternoon San Franciscomy name is Gregory and I'm coming fromBelgium and I hope in the next coming 30minutes really to focus on the part onthe topic of the power of the customer Ithank you all as Future Leaders I'm surethat for many months and many years youare ready or try to get as close aspossible to your customers byco-creating product and services to makesure that you're getting close or veryclose to their personal Ambitions butalso keep far away from what they do notlikenow before I continuelike I said I'm Gregory for Linden andI'm part as of cognizant and I'm proudto be part of cognizant coherizon has abig Heritage of always being veryleading in being an early adopter aroundtechnology and also doing Innovation onthe edgeI'm also extremely proud that we are avery Multicultural environment and lastweek I think some magic happened is thatour Indian colleagues succeeded inlanding on the moonand the moon land that is calledBrianand this is in sankris Sanskrit the wordmeans wisdomand if you scale it down and you go toGyan this is all is about knowledge wellI hope in the next coming 30 minutes toshow you that generative AI bring us anextensive part of new knowledgewhich I hope that we all will be appliedto create more wisdom in our own livesbut let's now gookaycustomer experience or the segment ofone or hyper personalization of how wecall it let's be honest happy customersalways buy moresecondly I think we are all consciousthat if you look to customer experiencewe've been throwing like hell money toit but we miserly failed and we willneed to reset and restart the way of howwe deliver customer experiencethirdly a lot of research has proventhat even your customers are willing topay a higher price if the products orthe services that you're delivered aresustainableand fourthly if I look to my son he onlystart doing Financial or banking actionsat eight o'clock in the evening andhardly do anything overnightso in the context of a segment of one Ithink we will read to reimagine everyaspect and I see three core categoriesthe first category is the focus on thepersona for many years in the context ofhyper personalization we have tried tounderstand the individual I've learnedthat this is not good enoughwe also need to understand the communityaround the individual when I was talkingwith our marketing lady last week shehad dinner with her friends and sincetoday she is buying Echo paper I need toknow thatthe second topic is the marketplace themarketplace is where we connect thecustomer with our Enterpriseand they will see there many companiesare trying to apply the kind of Amazonmodel next to their core products andservices they are selling more and otherthings and they're also leveraging theecosystemand then thirdly our core if I want tobe digital in the front end and I wantto get into a real-time dimensionbut if my God is not modernized thenstill there's a lot of a lot of manualhandshakes happening there I will neverbe able to deliver on that promiseand there you already see with Janet APIwe have a massive opportunity I willtalk mostly about our generativecustomer experience Navigator which Ithink is focused on the personas but onthe marketplace also there the conceptof indeed degenerative knowledgeNavigators where we indeed are able toFast Track information Discovery we areable to create much more advancableinsights and augment our decisions is aquite powerful means and then if we talkabout the core yeah the core I thinkwe want to optimize processes yeah butalso do not forget in the car and wehave been in one of our thoughtleadership papers around the future ofus data management is one of the mostunderestimated jobs that we need to doguess what generative AI can help us tocomplete this journeyhow does it all connect togetherwell like I said the power of thecustomer is increasing much moreand I think I will prove even that it'sgetting into a kind of insane statebut we need to accept that this is partof the reality a lot of theorganizations are trying to create kindof new Revenue models yeah to their coreServices look in the financial world Ihave some Financial customers thatreally are creating a kind ofmarketplace to create also type of newRevenue models yeah equally also indeedI would say to have an all-aroundServices perspective we still need tooptimize control but I think I see thata lot of Enterprises really want tobecome their best friends of theircustomers they want to keep theircustomers on track they want to becometheir life coach their personal advisorand to be able to succeed in doing thatthere is one essential part we cannotbroadcast any more information to themwe need to get into an active dialogueand I'm proud that I can mention thisyeahbecause I think part of creating thatemotional connection for a lot of youall in this audience I think theimplementation of conversation AI wasalready a big stepand I'm very proud that we are allowedto mention it in the fact that we are apartner of ING Bank who has a ClearVision around the human Channel Visionstrategy were indeed the core entrypoint is their mobile banking appbut they have succeeded with theimplementation of conversational AI todeflect much more to chatat the same time to receive and took outto a higher level of customersatisfaction but equally also true yeahwhen they see it's becoming indeeddifficultstill they got the human touch of thevideo call that starts up where thecustomer gets human adviceand again this is a nice example of anextremely first good step in the contextof creating that emotional connectionbut guess whatconversation AI is good but the contextof intense and intense creation is stilla word it's still a burdencould we do something about thatso let's now start aboutgenitive AIand I think it all started a little bitin for every and I think we were honoredto be able to participate andcollaborate with with our customers butalso leverage the better products of ofGoogleand I think I've learned two thingsfirst of all you do not know more thanme so I think we all need to cook toco-create and collaborate every daybecause the world is so moving fast thatthe reality is in the combination of theknowledge of both of us what today ispossible or not possible tomorrow ispossible so we need to continuouslytrack and follow every day what ishappening but then the good enoughstatement first is the perfect tailorsperfect job I've learned that there arethree types of weighing of how toleverage foundational models or applygenerative AI you can apply it out ofthe box based on API calls but you alsocan take a tailored Channel tvi approachwhich I will show we have done and wehave taken that as an opportunity andthen the third one I think I don't knowif you saw it as cognizant but we'realso quite committed to make sure thatcertain large language models aregetting into a certain domain a certainfunction of value where we help tocreate to complete the chords next ofthe large language modelsbut here is the magic that I think iscreating all the excitement in thecontext of the impact on the customerJourneymulti-channel multi-language multi-rolethe CEO can talk with an agentsomebody sitting in Manila can talkFrench with somebody sitting in Belgiumand also I think in the month yourchannel perspective I can build ahistory and a memory that there is noreset anymore of the communication withmy customersso I'm getting by default to an extremeRich dialogueby the way I do this also by leveragingmy own information because I want todifferentiate and you see there on theright side yeahit can create a substantial costdecrease which we all like within theEnterprise but I think what is far moreimportantit also create bigger motivation withinour organizationwe have now customer services agentswith bigger type of motivation yeah andlet's be honest what's the best sourcefor customer satisfaction is havinghappy employees by because by defaultthey will deliver a service which Ithink is is betterI'm always saying instead of lipServices we made our hands dirtyand we proved whatever we haveenvisioned together with our customersbrought it into reality and we definedthree personas first of all usinggenitive AI in direct interaction withthe customersecond is call it the call agents or thefinancial advisors or the advisorswithin the company to to make use forgenitive AI as a product productivity toto enrich the dialogues and the thirdPersona was before even a customer getsinto a human communication that we arepre-preppedto immediately kick off the rightcommunication and we do this byleveraging and using information comingout of our conversational AI systemsout of our call center systems out ofour CRM databases out of our productdatabases so I think we have beenleveraging this big time I'm alwayssaying I've been honoredto work together with my teams withdifferent financial institutionsdifferent telcos and different mediacompanies and I think that is where wehave created the excitement in what wehave and what we will shown around ourtailored tailored info about that wehave created because what were thedesign of the customer experiencesprinciplesfirst of all we needed to make sure thatwe create the right questions andanswers there needs to be a reasoning ahistory and memorywe tried the calculation and certainlythe personalizationlet's startthe soccer dilemmathe left sideis the customer services that I shouldhave Kelton but guess what what happenedit was Friday noonmy setup box from my television field itwas brokenokay I'm renting the device so I went tothe services Job Shop and they gave meanother set of books I come at homethe auto install fieldswhat do I do I pick up the phone and Icall the customer service and they sayMr for Lindenbad luck it's four o'clock our backoffice is already starting the weekendwe will not be able to do anything andso you will need to wait until Mondaybefore we can look about how to fix theperspective and I'm saying guys butit's weekend do I now need to tell myfamily no television this weekendI will be the bad messenger they willkill meyeah Mr Linden sorry but we cannot doanythingsoas being a responsible dad I go to thefamily and say no television thisweekendand guess what my daughter said Daddy noproblemyou have an iPadwe have an app a television app on theiPad from the same Telco companywe have a smart TVI launched the TV on my app I do a swipeand we look television and say oh my Godwell I think what we have proven herethis was really awesome by scraping someof the forums of discussions where allthe Telco discussions are happening webrought the information into playand look what happened there imaginethat the customer services agent thatwas serving me had that informationavailablehe or she would have said to me MrBelinda you have a problem but themeanwhile maybe do you have an iPod doyou have a second television yeah thatis indeed the art of the possible so I'msaying I'm now overnight as a consumerable to create a better customer servicethan the Enterprise itselfthis this is completely I call it insaneso the power of the customer is becomingenormous so we need to step up and makesure that we make big step in thedelivery of our customer service at thesame time as human beings we are limitedthe call center agent is limited in theknowledge well guess what if you bringsuch a productivity tools to themthey can deliver an awesome service andI'm sure that the call center agent ifhe's able or she is able to tell thatstorythey also will have a personal level ofsatisfaction which I think is is higherthe power of common knowledge againwe see he so henow what is I think very important alsois thatwe know who Sufi isso free as a customer of usand she has a mobile subscription nolandline no televisions description wealso know that she is a bad playerso I think Sophie is now asking inwhatever language that she wantsshe can ask it in French she can ask itin English in Flemish it does not matteranymore for us yeahbut to also look to the answer that wehave been giving to herwe know her situationso to offer a bundlewould have not created a convenience sowe have said okayyou want to have television we cangive you a single service and activateit overnight instead of of bringing abundle to her two things we have learnedout of that first of all the conveniencefactor if I would have proposed a bundleto Sophieknowing that she already has itfinancially difficultthis would create a bad feeling from hersideat the same time yeah in genitive Ai andthis is the challenge around leakage Icannot share them the fact that I knowthat she maybe has been hard in payingher bills so I need to make damn surethat when I answered the question I donot expose the fact that I know thisperfectand then lastly what I want to mentionherewe want to Leverageon private informationand always making the Allen the G isthat everybody said the move to Cloudwill save a lot of money and a lot ofyou ended up paying even more moneyI think also here and I think I'm stilldo not know the answer but we still needalso the fact of if we bring informationinto playit's tokenized and there is a financialmodel behind that that's also somethingthat we need to create we can create abetter world yeah but it needs to be abetter word to also at a fair priceokayand this is the big excitementI have two excitements to tell today butthis is big and every customerthey were flabbergasted when they sawthisif I create an answer it's not just goodenough to just to create an answerif I need to tell my daughter about howtodrag a banking statement out of abanking app if I give her five keywordsit's enoughbecause she knows she's digitalshe knows how to do it if I call myfather of 80 years oldif I give him five words I'm gettingnowhere I need to be very verydescriptive so look to Victor he's 75years old I need to be very verydescriptive to Victor in the steps thathe needs to take into account so imagineyeah your call agents knowing thatVictory is 75 years oldyou give him the perfect guidance totell a story and give an answer which Ithink Victor will likeimagine that you need to ask Victor alsoto install an app on his iPad yeah so Ithink for me I think this this this Ithink this is an excitement where Ithink if we are in customer serviceeverybody wants wants to bring this intothe kind of realitythe magic of prompt engineeringI will come on back but promptengineering if I talk about tailoredgen AI then prompt engineering is yourmasterpieceand look here to PeterPeter thinks that hewill be able to fool us he will test thesystem and we actually went to a Telcoone to show this because Peter says I'veseen that if I would buy now a newsubscription I would get a discount of25 percentwhat happened if I now justcancel my subscription and I subscribeunder the name of my wifeas you're part of the same family it'snot allowedso you see the answer that has beencreated is the fact that Victor couldtry butwill not flyI think what is also important hereis what we call the tone of voicein an Enterprise context I'm sure thatall of your Enterprises have defined theway of how to communicate to yourcustomers a kind of communication styleso you do not only need to have an agood answer you also need to make surethat it's applied in the context of yourcommunication style and I think the artof prompt engineering is there againmaking the big differenceand if you want to take one picturetodayI think that's my golden slideand prompt Engineering in the context ofgenerative AI is something that we allneed to masterit's not an engineering pieceit's an artand look hereit's like you get access to the universeyou have the access to a knowledge whichis as big as the universe if I want tocreate Embrace or some value out of it Iwill need to start peeling the onion toget to a pointed very quality answerand that's what we do with the art ofprompt engineering we are workingtogether very closely with Google onthis and still let's be honest it's anevery week still discussion topic abouthow we fine-tune the role around promptengineering and look herewe are that defines our belongingor reacting in the financial world orreacting in the domain world in theretail worldI think that is what we Definewe're also a character and a name whichjob role do we have do I remember Forumoperator I'm a call agent I'm a CEO of acompany and I have a namethen you define the missionthe the mission defines a little bit thebehaviorbecause I can ask a question and kind ofgive an immediately a responsebut I also can say no no don't giveimmediately a response ask a few extraquestions to fine-tune and to get moreknowledge about the situation to betheir pointed because let's be honestprompt engineering you want to do twothings I think which I think I'm surehas been one of your main concernsleakage leakage prevention andhallucination preventionand let's be honest I thinkwe need to make sure that weknow a lot of information we bring a lotof information into play to create thatperfect answer but we cannot just betransparent in everything that we playback maybe there is a Privacy Rule thatwe are not allowed to share back forinstance the amount of money that he orshe earns at the moment yeah or I thinkwe had a nice example if you're 70 yearsold and you go to a bank you don't get aloan anymore that's so many the productdescription I cannot just say bluntly toa 70 or old guy that is asking for aloan guess what you will not get it yeahyou potentially will defer it to aTunisia the history aspect is also avery nice oneyeah like I said in the in themulti-channel approach what is thebiggest frustration is the reset of thediscussionand I think here also in context of ourTaylor Janam tvi approach we've built inwe have a history a history of all thesessions and we know our customer weknow our customer and we're alwaysbuilding back on what we have learnedout of the of the timethen defining the contextyou know that bringing that informationinto play yeah we're taking that anabstract of the text blocks that we willuse that we finally then indeed willclassify as truths which we calledembeddings which I think is a veryimportant perspectiveand defining that context is also verykey in the context of sayingdon't assume anythingif you cannot create the answer becauseit's not part of the knowledgeperspective don't try to be creativemake sure that you hand over to a humanagent perspective and then lastly Ithink in detail the personalizationapproach which I have saidwe use the pound toothe Bison version I like the pictureyeah and we also have learned heresomething around Levy it's again a verynice example of reasoning can I ask canI borrow moneyhe's a customer yeah we confirm he canhe can borrow some money from uscan I land 10K no problem I can learn10Kcan I land 5Kif I can land 10K I can have 5K but tryto do that with the traditional chatbotyou will not get this answer so againthe reasoning is there but I think whatis more important here is also wechallengedwe challenged a large language model todo calculations we uploaded a PDF withformulas in it yeah and we challenged todo calculationsbat IDand that's also the reason why ascognizante we have what we call our AIcognitive framework because there's somethings that an L M can do but in thecontext of our use case and use casedelivery you see we will always make acombination of still AI narrow AItogether with genitive AI and if youwant to know more we as cognizant haveeven built a kind of neural modelorchestrator where we bring togetherthat Ai and narrow geniei and narrow AIwell together if I run a kyc process Ineed to make damn sure that the outcomesare right because if they are not rightI can I can get indeed a findso againput it in a context yeah and use it forthe context that it is therethe last big excitement is this one andthe leftthe left is there just forto be able to understand the dialogueit's really about what is in the middleand on the rightand what you see there we have our dearfriend Levy who's speaking Flemish whois asking a questionand you seeon the right side that Noor who issitting in Manilais having a simultane is having usorchestrating the dialogue with himand you see what's happeningLevy is asking a questionis translated into her local languagegenitive AI is immediately proposing toher what a potential good answer wouldbe that she could give to him and sheneeds only to confirm it's translatedand it's going back into into ainto Flemishdid you get it language is not aconstraint anymorehow much of our customer servicesdepartment have we tried to Off Trackand offload to lower price countries andtrying to reduce our costs but on theback of what delivering a worsercustomer service well here you see nowlanguage is not a barrier anymore and Ithink yeah you also get nor who is muchmore happy to create a quality answerback so she's more motivated in doingthat and you see on the other side ofthe world I'm sure that Levy is alsogetting extremely happy with the answerthat he is he's gettingokayour lessons learned around Genet APIthat we have applied Within TheseFinancial customers and also within theTelco customersI would summarize as three mainimportant thingsthe first thing is about finding the usecasedo not underestimate thisbecause generative Fai has a multi-taskDimension and can play in your processnot one role but maybe thousand rolls intrying to identify what the art of theopportunity is within the use case withthe applying genitive AI I think it's amasterpiece that's also the reason whyyou see that to be able to achieve thiswe also bring in many different rolesinto play to be able to do that thisneeds to incorporate not onlyengineering but also a very advancedlevel of design thinkingthe second part is then we start doingsomething with it and we call it acohita framework yeah like I saidyou want to create the best answer it'sbad for calculations you want to stillmake a combination between traditionalAi and channel tvi in creating the bestresponse and the best answer to that andthat the art of prompt engineering isyour Masterpiece it's your Marcus masterorchestratorbut then we need to bring it intoproductionand the responsible AI equation I thinkit was also this morning mentionedmultiple timeswe cannot export this towards the futureI'm an old guyI'm 25 years in the industry and Istarted 25 years ago discussions aboutmaster data managementI have customers that now start spendingmoney on itthat's the same also with envelopes yeahI think we have been talking about itfor many years surrounded how many haveacted implemented in a serious way wecannot export it anymore if we want tobe serious with challenge DVI we willneed to do it in a responsible way in anEnterprise world and so we need toprofessionalize the way of workingand you see that also whatever is inyour use case in the context of yourprompt engineering on a responsible AIit's always a combination of threethingsyou need Ai and engineering but you alsoneed a lot of strategy and designelements and do not forget complianceand regulation is also key and I'mcoming from Europewe have again the Masterpiece of theEuropean AI act so by default There IsNo Escape anymore around the legal thethe legal stuff that we need to do butat the same time in your use caseidentificationyou will need to ask the question if Iuse a large language model if that modelis in line with my ethical standardswithin my company I don't know how manyof you have defined ethical standardswithin your companybut you will need to make them availableand even test your two test use caseagainst against thislast if I read the Press I'm alwaysthinking and listening about Doomthinking the world is going bustedwe are again killing all jobs withjanitive AI noyeah we are impacting Big Time knowledgeworkersbut do not forget what we just talkedabout is the fact that first of all tobe able to do something successful withgenerative AI we will more than everneed a soccer team because thecollaboration will be key our userresearch experience design peoplefront-end developers and promptEngineers will need to work and grouptogether as one team but there are alsomany new jobs that will be created Icall it the ethical sourcing manager thebuy specialist the AI product managerthe data Detectiveso okay we all will save a lot of timein our work in the context of doinganalyzes and research we will get morequality back or more quality time backbut equally also we'll see there are alot of roles and you see here also alittle bit of a view about the way ofhow we think in a kind of four layeredapproach about applying genetic VI youhave your interaction layer you haveyour genitive AI layer you have yourcomputation layer yeahand I think we learned out of the pastif we Implement AIit was not because we have developed thepsdi that it was used by somebody theyneed to trust it but they also needs tobe make sure that it works in a kind ofperformance and a good way and thenlastly but at least yeahplaying and using our own privateinformation and bringing that in play Ithink is keyto complete without conclusion I'malways sayingwho doesn't want to have second brainI think we all do yeahmy wife is telling me that she is mysecond brain yeahbut so I think yeah I think we get nowan extension to our brain and I want torepeat also I think one of our famousstatements of our CEOI think we're all constrained in ourintellectual capacitywith generative AI that intellectualcapacity that becomes available hasextendedso we will get much more timeto focus on Innovation and valuecreation and I think that's the magicopportunity I think I believe for all ofusbut I think for me the four key versesdo not forget there's a lot ofexcitement in the marketbut we still will need to apply it intoan Enterprise contextand that's a little bit more complexwe need to do it in a responsible waycollaboration will be key and I thinkprompt engineering will be more thanever yeah leading in in in in in in thatperspectiveand I want to thank you also for beinghere but I also want to thank my heroesyeah and these are my heroesthey have been able to make the art ofthe possible possibleand look to Rigo I never forgot the daythat he came into my office and sayGregory it is a beast yeah and it wasthe art of saying how can I now managethe Beast and I think with the art ofbrunt engineering we succeeded inmanaging the beast but let's be honest Ithink there's still a lot to learn andthere is certainly a lot of still yeahcollaborate together with you in makingthis kind of game-changing Step areality within our Enterprises thank youthank you"
