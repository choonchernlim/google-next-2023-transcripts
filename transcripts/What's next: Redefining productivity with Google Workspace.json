the start of thepandemic meat wasn't ready to take onthe new world of remote and hybrid workand many of our customers opted to use adifferent meeting solution entirelybut since that time we've investedheavily in meat launching hundreds ofnew features and transforming it into anEnterprise grade meeting Solution that'sdeeply integrated into workspacebest of all customers are voting withtheir feet and returning to meetin fact Gartner peer insights hasrecognized Google as a customer's choicein unified Communications as a servicefor 2023what makes this award so special to usis that it came from our customers whochoose to use Google meet over otheralternativesso if you haven't tried meat lately Iencourage you to give it another look Ithink you'll be blown awaybut we aren't stopping

expansionfirst thing every morning Quinn grabsher phone checks what the day has instore she sees lots of unread emailsfrom the leadership team it's going tobe a busy dayso she hops on her laptop and sees theduet has summarized an overnight emailthread from her team in Europe that is25 deep enabling her to catch up quicklybut likely would have taken her an hourof reading trying to figure out what'sgoing on is summarized in seconds butnow Quinn needs to quickly figure outwhat action items have already beenidentified but duet is already on it andsuggests a list of action items to helpinstead of wasting valuable time tryingto figure out what needs to get doneacross the team with duet Quinn couldimmediately focus on getting to workand next Quinn asked duet to help herwrite a detailed reply evenlyDistributing the key action items acrosstheir team let's see what we get back isdo it works its magic over hereand it's processing and there we go justwhat Quinn was looking for saving hereven more time Quinn sends that emailand now she needs to get to work thatsales training isn't going to happen byitself or is itsales team in South America needs to getready for customer meetings and it'sQuinn's job to train and provide themwith the material they need to get thoseorders coming inQuinn asked duet to create a calendarinvite with the sales team in SouthAmericaQuinn's validating the suggestedcalendar invite to make sure it'sexactly what she wantedand as she's approving it she realizesshe doesn't need to think about anyone'sschedule finding a meeting room oradding a meat video link to the inviteshe definitely won't miss doing thatneither will I now Quinn needs somethingto present to that sales team it tookthe marketing team in the U.S a week tocreate the sales presentation for theinitial release of the coffee line butthe South American markets are uniqueand their customers have differentpreferences in the past queen of woodenspent hours if not days working with thelocal team updating the presentation tomake it relevant for this local targetaudience but she is a better way to getwhat she's done needs done now not threedays from now so Quinn opens up herslide presentation she selects the slideshe wants to edit types in the promptwhat she's looking for let's seegenerate a slide based on the salestraining dock which is in her localDriveand wow just like that Quinn is going tosee how polished a new slide could lookand they were created with just a fewwords this feels like magic but it'sduetbut she needs to make the image on thisslide feel relevant for her audience soshe asked duet to generate an image of acoffee field with the Brazilian flagblowing in the windDuets suggests four options and asthey're working to generate them shesees the first one looks great she looksat the newly created slide and isexcited to see that the generated textimages and speaker notes look likesomething she would have crafted herselfand now she could focus on the salestraining instead of staying late at worktrying to finish this deckQuinn has been so focused on working andgetting a week's worth of work done inthe morning she has a brief moment ofpanic when she sees how messy her homeoffice is and right before she's aboutto get on a call with the sales team butdon't worry Quinn duet has you coveredhow about a custom virtual background tohelp protect your privacy and celebratethe sales team in Brazil which issymbol's largest Workforce in SouthAmerica there's no scouring the internetrequiredQuinn uses duet and meat to create aunique background and in this exampleshe's showing a coffee shop with thepainting of the golden trumpet treewhich is Brazil's natural flower emblemin just a few clicksshe's happy with that Quinn joins themeeting and gets excited that she seeshundreds of Sellers from across SouthAmerica joining from their homes andsymbols Regional Offices one of thesales leaders in Brazil asked thepricing question in Portuguese but Quinndoesn't speak Portuguese that's nolonger a problem duet automaticallytranslated into English in real time andtranslates our answer back intoPortugueseduet has also been summarizing theconversation and listing key actionitems for the people who join the calllate or who were multitasking at the endof the call do it also sends out asummary of the call with all the actionitems accomplishing in seconds wouldhave taken her at least 30 minutes inpost call workbut there were so many thoughtfulquestions and requests from the salesteam during the call that Quinn wants tocapture this information in FAQ shesimply asked duet to do it and hitsenter and another helpful buttime-consuming task that would havetaken Quinn an hour more in the past iscompleted in seconds and now that wehave that sales team trained whatproduct announcement would be completewithout a blog post sharing howtransformational this product is yesthese days even coffee needs to betransformationalbut a well-crafted blog post localizedacross regions languages and can be timeconsuming process but let's see how duetcan help since the product was alreadyannounced in the United States Quinncould leverage all that core messagingin the original blog post but you'llneed to tailor the story to resonatewith customers in South America in orderto break through and have an impactadding some local customer storiesimagery and Trends always drives more ingreat engagementso Quinn clicks on duet and asks it todraft a blog post for the South Americanlaunch based on existing U.S blog postsand a file with customer stories as yousee she types it in she's pulling up afile from her drive to other blog postsand it pulls up the customer referencefile now duet AI goes to work and it'sgeneratingthat blog post for her and wow with justa few words do a crafted a solid draftthat also includes a customer quotecompleting in second would have takenher hours in the pastQuinn feels good about this content butthinks the blog post is a little bitlong and could be even better if it wasshorter and more engaging so Quinn askedyou at AI to rewrite the draft with thetone and length based on a previous blogpost from the region that she knows hashigh traffic and engagementthere we goshe inserts thatsince she's in docs Quinn cancollaborate easily and effectively withothers in the dock she invites them totrusted stakeholders to make somecomments in the doc let's see she'sadding her stakeholders and then she'sgoing to type a note to themrequesting their feedback and know thatthe blog post will be ready to go soonQuinn wants to maximize the reach ofthis message now and a new ad campaignwill do just the trick so Quinn promptsduet to craft a few headlines based onthe blog postlet's see what she gets back hereDuets working it's magic and there we gofive headlines nice short catchy andusing the narrative from her blog shecan definitely use these headlines tohelp amplify in symbols campaignwith the blog post in good shape Quinn'steam wants to get on a real-time statusupdate and see how all the preparationis going one of her team members createsa huddle in chat so Quinn can share theprogress she's been makinglet's see they're all joining and shewants to make sure that leadership andthe sales team know that everything isready to go to have a quick conversationthey're talking to each other she letsthem know they're ready to go and donethat was really efficient in meat theteam is really impressed and they can'tbelieve how she was able to create suchhigh quality work so quickly shereceives tons of Kudos from across thebusiness it's coming in fast thatfeedback is coming in so fast that Quinnneeds some help keeping up with theconversation but since she knows she caninteract with dueted chat she asks herto summarize the thread for her so allshe doesn't have to go through readingall those messages and just like that doit was able to give Quinn uh a greatmessage and she was able to prepare forthis product launch in South Americastay ahead from competition andcapitalize on the massive Marketopportunity this level of speed andefficiency
