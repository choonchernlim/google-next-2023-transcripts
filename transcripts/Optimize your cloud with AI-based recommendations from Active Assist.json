Major League Baseballand I'm also an active active assistuser and I also have Ryan with me heretodayI'm Ryan ismer I'm a product manager foractive assistant that means part of myjob is making it easier for all of youto find useful recommendations and adoptthem in your environmentwe have about 30 minutes to talk to youabout activist's recommendations todayI'm really excited to share the stagewith Frank he's been a great partner forus over the past year or two and we'reexcited to show you what we've beenworking on for the past year and some ofthe stuff coming in uh coming up in thefutureso this is a breakout session we'll talkat you for about 30 minutes and thenhopefully we'll have some interactive qa to um fill in any gaps for Contentthat we missedum I will start off with a briefintroduction to active assist uhrecommendations help you understand ourmotivation and then I'll hand it over toFrank and he'll talk a little bit aboutthe Major League Baseball experiencewith the recommendationshe'll hand it back to me I'll talk aboutsome of the great things we've launchedin the past year and a couple of the uhforthcoming launches that we're reallyexcited to share information with youtodayjust for reference just to see what sortof audience we have here todayum how many people in the audience haveactually used activist's recommendationnot a lot great that's why we're heretoday is to help fill in some of theblanks and hopefully show you some waysto get more value out of out of theproduct that we makeone point of clarificationis to make sure no one's in the wrongspot at the wrong time there is adifferent product called the vertexrecommendations AI to help you buildrecommender systems that is not whatwe're talking about today we are talkingabout a product that makes proactivesuggestions for you to help you optimizeyour Cloud environment so if anybodyneeds to scoot off to a differentbreakout session I'll avert my eyes uhtemporarily hereno one's sneaking out I guess that'sgood okay let's go ahead and jump inso several years it became evident to usat Google and to the industry at largethat the complexity of our Cloudenvironments is a growing concern with anumber of negative effects for us infact a couple years ago half of all ofthe c-suite executives that weresurveyed said that the complexity oftheir Cloud environments was the numberone thing holding back their Cloud Roithat's a pretty Grim statement therethese days with increased regulatoryrequirements new Cloud products that wekeep launching economic challengeeconomic challenges and competitiveconcerns the problems have just gottenworseso when we sat back and thought about itat Google we thought the cloud iscomplex perhaps unavoidably so butmanaging it shouldn't be as tough as itis right nowpart of our job is to help all of yousafely see through the complexityto reduce your operational toil whilekeeping you in controlwe created activist a couple years agoactivists data intelligence and machinelearning to make suggestions to help youproactively optimize your Cloud makingit easier for you to build deploy andmanage your workloads at scalewe make recommendations to you in whatwe call our six value pillars these areessentially the business value that youshould expect from us help you manageyour costs intelligently improve yoursecurity improve your reliabilityimprove your performancewe help you with managementmanageability which is just a long wordthat means it should take you lesseffort to get the same results out theend we should help you reduce the toilinvolved in managing your cloud and thenfinally we can also help you improveyour sustainability by reducing yourworkloads carbon footprintthat probably sounds great but from theshow of hands earlier most of you arenew to activists so your first questionis probably where do I find these activeassist recommendationscan find them primarily in three placeslet's start on the console every projecthas a recommendations up there's a linkon your project landing page that saysrecommendation and if you go visit thatyou will see all the recommendations forthat specific project if they existif you go there this evening and youdon't see anything bear in mind thatevery recommendation has unique IAMpermissions that you need to Grantyourself to see them they're fairlyfine-grained so you may need to checkthe documentation pages to determinewhat IAM permissions you needalsomany recommendations have an observationwindow it could take up to 90 daysbefore our algorithms have confidenceenough to start making recommendationsfor you so don't give up if you have anew project and you visit it and there'sno recommendation there for you quiteyetalso in the recommendations Hub you canfind a link to a bigquery export of allyour recommendationsthis is an export of all of therecommendations in your organization itdoesn't matter what project you youaccess it from it's still an export foryour entire organization so that setupprocess will involve you creating aservice account with the rightpermissions to access that higher scopeof recommendation we'll talk a littlebit later about some of the enhancementsthat we've made to that this past yearalso in the console you can findrecommendations in context as we referto it this means as you're doing yourdaily job maybe you're on the VM listpage and you'll look at the table andyou'll see a recommendation there thatsays you can save some money by rightsizing this VM you might be visiting theIAM page to look at your permissions andyou might see some things that say thatyou have too many IAM permissions ormore than you need for a particularprinciple so we call that in contextyou'll see recommendationsas you're doing your daily job in theconsole these share all the same statethey're the same recommendations asyou'll find in the hub so if you applyit or dismiss it in one place it'll beglobally updated for you you don't needto worry about where you take that andthen finally we have an API if youprefer an interface or have a systemthat you want to use other than aconsole uh this is a great way for youto integrate with your platform as aservice your change management system orwhatever your preferred way is to takerecommendations at scale you have acouple interesting blog posts if you'reinterested in using the API about how touse this to sort of bulk acceptrecommendations on that note I'll turnit over to Frank and he'll Deep dive onMajor League Baseball's experienceawesome thank you very much RyanI'm Frank as you may have heard fromwhat five minutes ago I am the principalCloud architect at Major League Baseballand I also lead our phenops initiativemy job basically boils down tohow do we make good choicesand that is where active assist hasactually become a trusted partner in theentire ecosystem that is MLB's Cloud itcan do everything project levelrecommendations the bigquery export withthe looker dashboard over top of it tomake it a little nicer and uh by the waysomething really cool coming on that alittle bitand the interesting part is how theteams plug into it the developers theyget that immediate feedback right in theconsole a little light bulb pops upgood to go take a look see what it'sdoingthen you're able to surface it up inthat bigquery export for an SRE team tostart looking at those largeroverarchingcapacity issues or if you see VMS thatare a little over utilizednot your first line of defense but it'sanother nice Trend to be able to keeptrack ofand of course our friends in financesaving moneyso Major League Baseball has some Cloudpriorities and I myself have some butfirst let me start with a show of handswho here has heard of baseballyeah that one better than I did Frankthat went better than I expected allright so who's a fan of baseballall right we'll work on thatso what it comes down to is fans are allof us anyone who's enjoyed baseball wentto a gameor even sitting in the backyardpretending to be a famous player don'tworry the puns they're just gettingworse from hereanywaythe end goal is to be responsible withour Cloud usage while providing a goodexperience to the fansthis isn't meant to be a marketing talkat the end of the day my focus our focusat MLB is on the fansand in doing so we havethree pillars similar to what Ryan gotinto they are make good choices lowerthe amount of toil and keep Financehappylet's talk about thoseso with making good choices it is anextra set of eyes in the environmentit's going through all of your projectslooking for these recommendations theseidle VMS it's able to surface them tothe individual teams we are starting toaggregate them up to business units andalso the leadership over this soeverybody has visibility into what'sgoing onand second up is lowering toilit does the hard thing it does the easythings so I can focus on the fun thingsif you have worked in gcp you'veprobably done researching and auditingthrough 10 20 30 projectswhen you start getting any more thanthat it takes a lot of timeonce again this is where active assistcomes in it's able to look at all of theprojects regularly and spit out all ofthis information right to youit's also easier as I've said before forthe developers to see therecommendations in real time providingthat fast feedbackMLB's devops team is a very small coreteam and we take shift leftexceptionally seriously where we'rewrapping modules and trying to put asmuch empowerment with the developers aswe can so they can do what they need toinnovate and put out cool stuff forbaseballand my favorite example is QA needs tofire up a load test we've got all theinfrastructure up we run the testeverything looks goodwe go give the report to whoever needsit sign off close the laptop walk awaythose VMS are still runningand runningand costing you moneyand runningonce again this is where active assistcomes in we all forget things activeassist keeps an eye out for usat number three keeping Finance happythat's an obvious one being able tosurface those recommendations and watchthe big numbers go away makes everybodyhappy at the end of the dayso let's look at a few real examples ofwhere active assist has helped meVM right sizing and idle VMS is my firsttopicactiveassist allows insights acrossMLB's entire organization as I saidbefore it helps with those simple tasksgoing through everythingand being able to just pop open a windowtake a look at what's going on do thatevery couple of days or if you'reexcitable you can use the API which isalso a very cool feature by the wayalso configurable idle detection nowwith gke supportand now what that means is there's aperiod of time it takes todetect an idle VMsome people's environments are differentyou're able to change that time Ryan cantalk about it more I will uh Not waxpoetic about this but it's one of thethings I'm excited aboutanyway VM right sizing it lets you seethe idle the over the oversized and theunused and sometimes unfortunately thoseundersized VMS the ones that are justrunning hot all the time and nobody mayknow aboutsecond up Cloud SQL because data has tolive somewhereit is easy to use it's easy to overprovisionwe are trying to let developers developand get out of the wayand that's where active assist comes into keep an eye out for usso going back to my topic of QAspinning up that performance testingdatabase it's big it's sitting thereit's costing you moneybut you still need it because there'sintegration testing going on slowlyafter itdo we just keep it bighow am I going to properly size andscale thisyou don't have to think anymore give ita bit of period of timeactive assist provides a recommendationmake sure it's sane plug it in good togoand my last topic committed usediscounts saving money on resourcesyou're already usingohI love the phrase on this slide and Ibet people can relatebig number go upanywaycommitted use discounts are astraightforward way to generatesubstantial savings across your entirefleet and quicklywhen effectively implemented and managedthey are an easy way to generatesubstantial savings there are a ton ofdifferent types of types of committeduse discounts there are compute engineCloud SQL Cloud run and several otherswe can talk about those after the factand they've also come out with flexiblecommitted use discounts where it's adollar based spend versus resourcethank you by the way for therecommendations on thatspeaking of whichI've got my slide notes here this isvery helpfulspeaking of which the percentage of therecommendationas you may or may not be aware baseballis very seasonal what we do we have ouropening day our normal run rates WorldSeriesand then the off seasonand it's figuring out how to properlyset up your committed youth discounts soyou're not spending a bunch of money inyour off season while still making sureeverybody is reasonably happy during theseason and making sure we as fans canget baseballand now we have percentage of coveragein active assist go in poke the buttonadjust it to say 67 percentand it's good to go and you get thosepositive recommendations out of it everytimeand one cool thing as well with thisthese recommendations also tie into thedashboard that gives you a ton ofinsight and you can click around you canplay with it and see exactly how it'sgoing to affect your environmentslong-term short-term the date pickerit's a ton of fun anyway we have theDeep integrate they have the DeepIntegrations with the dashboard and theresearch and those are three majorthingsthat I love about activistsback to you Ryanthanks Frankall right hopefully now you have alittle bit better idea about how anactual customer uses the actual productas opposed to my philosophicalintroduction with that context in mindum I want to share some of our recentlaunches uh to help you start connectingthe dots for your organization as wellseeing areas where activists might helpyou reduce your costs improve yoursecurity and so onI'm only going to cover really the last12 months so if you're brand new toactivist I do suggest you go and checkour documentation well you'll find moreinformation on some of the for exampleright sizing recommendations uh thatFrank mentionedand then after we cover what we'velaunched in the past 12 months I'll alsotalk about two really exciting launchesthat will come out before the end ofthis yearalso this is a great point for me tonotice um I don't know what the phraseit takes a village originally referredto but they could have written it aboutrecommendations as well I'm up hererepresenting the work of literallyhundreds of googlers across a dozen ormore teams and I just want toacknowledge all the hard work that wentinto these and I'm going to blithely getup and give one sentence descriptions ofuh of these recommendations please bearthat in mind okay let's jump into thenew cost recommendationseveral new cost recommendations overthe past 12 months let's start with thebigquery options so we launched bigquerypartitioning and clustering which helpsyou figure out whether you can use atable partitioning or clusteringobviously to reduce your costs we alsohave a recommender that will help youcalculate cost optimal slot allocationwhile maintaining similar performancehaving bigquery users have found both ofthese very usefulthe third cost recommendation is thecloud run CPU allocation recommendationthis helps you figure out whether yourCPU allocation strategy can be switchedup when that's appropriate in order tosave you money bear in mind it's notalways appropriateFrank mentioned earlier configurable VMright sizing recommendations VM rightsizing recommendations have been aroundfor a while but we recently introducedyour ability to add configurationparameters and adjust that observationwindow to customize it for yourorganizationand finally we launched recommendationsto help detect idle gke cluster clusterswith no pods clusters with no nodes orlow CPU utilization generallywe have new cloud fun securityrecommendation this actually will pointout two different insights for cloud runthe first of those is it'll detectservice accounts that might haveexcessive or over provisioned IAMpermissions and it'll also help detectenvironment variables that may beleaking sensitive informationthe other security recommendation thatwe recently launched is for advisorynotifications these recommendationsdetect when your advisory notificationsetup is sending our security notices tosomeone who doesn't have the rightpermissions to view those notices in theconsole getting this right is veryimportant for making sure you'rereceiving critical securityCommunications from Google if you're notset up right this recommendation willlet you knowwe released some recommendations forcloud SQL that'll help you detectpotential memory issues so that you canfix problems before they occur and alsofor cloud functions this recommenderwill detect potential opportunities foryou to set a minimum number of instancesto avoid cold start problems with Cloudrunand finally we have a reliability a newreliability recommendation this one'spretty cool this one's called servicelimits many people refer to as a quotarecommender this analyzes your serviceusage and identifies resources that maybe on their way to getting close totheir quota limits so that you canproactively mitigate potential issuestherebesides new recommendations we didlaunch several new features to make allof these easier to useso we recently launched the ability foryou to share deep links torecommendation you can access theselinks either in the upper right handmenu of any recommendation Details pageor we have a blog post that shows youhow you can use the contents of yourbigquery export or the API to easilyassemble the SE links you can share withcolleagues you can add them to yourchange management system they willdirect the viewer back to the console sothey do respect the IAM permissions youdon't have to worry about sensitiveinformation about Foster securitylinking to folks who shouldn't see itwe've talked a lot about bigquery exportthis last year we launched our 2.0version of bigquery exportsome upgrades in the 2.0 version includeyour cost savings reflecting anydiscounts that your organization mighthave or credits this was always the casein the console but we've just added itto the bigquery export as well and weare also now exporting all of yourbilling account level recommendationsthose are your committed use discountsand also folder and organization leveldiscounts I'm sorry uh recommendation aswellum so now that export has your completeset of recommendations for you to accessall in in one placeum I think it's on my next slide butalso this year we made it possible foryou to export that to a non-us data setwhich was a pretty highly requestedfeature by some of our Internationalpartnersif you're interested in the bigqueryexport listen hard to one of theannouncements I'll make later which alsotalks to organization level visibilityum and also check online some of ourblog posts do a great job of showing youhow to set up looker and some of theother dashboarding products to maximizethe value that you can get from bigqueryitselfoh finally on this slide uh we're reallyexcited to announce that securityrecommendations are now being sent tosecurity Command Center starting withIAM recommendations the other securityrecommendations will follow this meansthat if you're in a security role atyour organization you can rely onsecurity Command Center being a singlepane of glass for you to do your jobokay I've talked a couple times abouthow every recommendation has veryfine-grained IM permissions this isgreat for control not so good fordiscoverability it means every time welaunch a new recommendation you have toknow about it and go add that permissionto the right folks in your organizationso we've also launched a global viewerroleif this is appropriate for yourorganization's policies you can use thisto get viewer permissions not permissionto apply the recommendations but just toview for all existing recommendationsand we will backfill permissions intothis role when we launch new Rec newrecommenders so hopefully this will helpa lot with folks who've struggled withdiscovering new recommendations as theycome along I already mentioned a BQexport to non-us Regions and so thefinal feature I just wanted to highlightif you are interested in using the APIwe know some organizations are hesitantto adopt apis that are not yet in GA sowe have upgraded our dismiss endpointfor our API from preview to GA that willlet you bulk dismiss recommendationsthat might not be appropriate for yourfor your organizationohokay so this is the part I'm reallyexcited about the stuff we've launchedthis past year has been real good stuffand is the way that on a day-to-daybasis you'll access a lot of thatbusiness value inside activists but I'mreally excited that I got permission toshare two upcoming launches that'll becoming before the end of the year thatwe think will really make a change foryou as well both of these will beavailable by the end of 2023.so the first of these is change riskrecommendations you will experiencethese in context and they willautomatically flag risky changes toCloud resources that our algorithms haveidentified as being important and whenwe present that to you we will presentthat the change is risky and why webelieve it you'll be able to view anassessment of why we think it's riskyand why we think the resource isimportant so for example if you'retrying to delete a highly used projector maybe modify IAM permissions anddownstream that might have an impact onyour user experience or your systemsrunning change risk recommendations canprevent these unintended issues so youhave a second chance if you will uh tonot make that change before uh beforepotentially impactingum we're introducing changesrecommendations for project deletionservice account deletion and IAMpermission modificationum and uh changes recommendations willbe available publicly before the end ofthe yearearlier I mentioned that you can findall of the recommendations for yourproject in the recommendationthis is wonderful that we have a centraldashboard in the console but we've heardthat it from all of you that it could beeasier and more helpful of an experienceumthe current experience you've told us ishard to find you can only find it fromthe project landing page it's difficultto navigate you have a lot ofrecommendations you scroll past a ton ofcards before you find the thing you'relooking for it doesn't support sortingand filtering so it can be a bit likesearching for a needle in a haystackmost criticallyit's only for a single project at a timeso if you care about an entire folder oracross your entire organization the onlything I've been able to use so far isbigquery export even if you havepermissions across the entireorganization the recommendation up onlyshows you recommendations for a singleprojectso I'm really excited we're happy toannounce a complete refresh of ourrecommendation of user interface thisnew UI will be accessible from left-handnavigationit'll support Oregon folder views thatrespect the purview Picker no custompicker hereum and it'll allow you to seeopportunities with the right permissionacross your entire organizationwhen you visit the new recommendationsHub you'll land on a dashboard page thatgives you an overview of theopportunities available to you 'll beable to easily navigate by value pillarwe heard from customers the way theywant to think about recommendations I'mworking on cost today I care aboutperformance so there'll be quicknavigation for category by categorybreakdown or you can view allrecommendations and you can sort andfilter to your heart's contentwhen you get a list of recommendationsthat you think is valuable again we'veheard that this isn't a one-personEndeavor right this is a team exerciseto review the recommendations and decidehow to adopt those so you'll be able toshare that entire list ofrecommendations sorted and filtered withyour team as well assuming you have thesame set of permissions that you havethey'll see the same listwe are really happy to announce thiswill be publicly available for everybodyto try before the end of the yearforeignthat's the end of the material that Ihave but before we close I want to givea huge thanks to Frank and to the restof his team of Major League Baseball fortheir partnership they really activelyengaged Us in both designing andvalidating uh our direction for this newrecommendation Hub experience in theconsole and we wouldn't be here wewouldn't be here on stage and none ofyou would have a new recommendations Hubexperience if it weren't for thecommitment that Frank showed to helpingus get better uh at what we do for allof youand thank you very much Ryan for lettingme complain at you a lotwhich has now turned into this new Hubexperience for all of you thank you verymuchforeign"
