    "transcript": "[Music]thank youhello good afternoon so glad to seeeveryone today I'm inshallah Andersonand I lead Global brand and creative forGoogle Cloudand I'm really excited for theconversation that we're going to havetoday about the role of cloud Ai andrevolutionizing access for disabledcommunities in terms of the products andservices that we can serve upSo today we're going to talk aboutaccessibility design and technology andexplore the ways in which Cloud AI canbe used to make the world moreaccessible for people everywhereand before I jump in I want to take amoment and introduce my esteemed yes KRLoom so I'm going to read from herebecause I wanted to make sure I did notmiss any detail because her bio is soamazingKR is a leader in disability inclusionand lgbtq plus rights she has been onthe Forefront of issues blazing a trailtowards inclusive design and marketingfor more than 25 years diagnosed withsevere hearing loss at the age of threehas made it her life's work to be astrong advocate for disabled peopleas the head of brand accessibility atGooglebrand Studio she drives innovation ofrepresentation and storytelling fordiverse disabled audiencesa segment that historically has beenoverlookedpeacefully lobbied on Capitol Hill withSenator Warren's team and help passlegislation called the over-the-counterhearing aid Act of 2017.because of this new law in 2022 hearingaids are officially being sold over thecountershe's on several boards such as deafkids code American Association of peoplewith disabilities and was appointed byPresident Biden to the

2019 top 50 future female leadersby Yahoo finance join me in welcoming KRthis afternoon thank you Angela it'swonderful to be hereso I'm so excited for this conversationum there's so much that we can talkabout when we consider the possibilitiesthat AI affords before we jump into theconversation it would be so helpful ifyou could set the stage give us a littlesense of context in terms of as we talkabout disability and the disabled Marketwhat does that look like and as weconsider accessibility marketing whydoes it matter right absolutely first ofall you know disability is somethingthat all of us will experience is soimportant in our lifetime I myself I wasborn with severe hearing loss I've hadthat disability my entire life and ifyou'll notice I'll be looking at itinshallah a lot because I am a lipreader so it's not that I don't want tolook at this lovely onion I said whitelights and I'm trying to follow along onthe conversation but that's one exampleof a disability many disabilities areinvisible or are visible but what'simportant to also understand isfor some peoplestability is something that you may beimpacted permanently like myself orsomething that's temporary that happenedto you at some point in your lifetime atemporary disability for example wouldbe that you scratched your eye you can'twear your glasses and then you're gonnahave a hard time seeing for a period oftime that's considered a temporarydisability and so when you think aboutthe audience that's over a billionpeople in the world that have adisability right when you think aboutthat why it matters and the businesscase around that you're talking about 8trillion in spending power anddisability in numbers is only growingit's not getting smaller it's gettingbigger and one in four adults in the UShave a disability but when you thinkabout not just the disabled communityand disabled people when you think aboutthe people around them their friendstheir family members their caregiverstheir co-workers now that number iscloser to 8 billion people so that's amassive massive Market that peopleshould be paying attention to in a worldwhere you know technology helps usaccess so much for a world that was notbuilt for disabled people there's somuch Innovation that AI is now going tobring to the forefronting kind of thingbringing to the Forefront and Innovationand design so I'm I'm really excitedabout the future of AI and Innovationfor disability and what it can do fordisabled peopleso that gives you a sense of context andthen I think from there I'd love tounderstand how Cloud AI when you thinkof AI technology can be used to make theworld more accessible how do we start tokind of give use cases give exampleshelp people understand that this is notjust sort of an altruistic Pursuit butit starts to bring so much more a senseof inclusion and belonging to audiencesthat may have been overlooked absolutelywhen when you look at even technologylike captioning for example right andcapturing was originally built for deafand hard of hearing Community to towatch film and TV but many of us hereprobably use captioning today is thatright yes absolutely but when you thinkabout Google cloud and live captioningand Google meets and the way that thattechnology has really helped people stayconnected and definitely during a timeof covering or pandemic that wasincredibly useful Innovation andtechnology that I think that will onlysee begin to become more mainstream morenormalized because when you build thisdesign when you build products forpeople with disabilities you're actuallybuilding products for everyone and whenyou're thinking about that Innovationfor disabled people you're really goingto be impacting someone like I saidearlier who may not have a disabilitytoday but may acquire one later in lifeand so what's important when you'rethinking about inclusive design andaccessible marketing is there has to bethe representation of the communityalong with the product that you'retrying to position or sell right sothat's where storytelling andauthenticity of disabled peoplerepresentation really matters when youlook at media today disabled people arerepresented less than two percentI'm talking about a billion people inthe world right so there's definitelysome work to be done but some reallygreat examples of that work is a coverstory that we we dig as an Oscarscommercial last year that talks aboutthe innovation of live captioningtechnology that Google has built theimpact in the communities that are tagand how it's brought people together andthe diverse representation of disabilityis really important so we're I thinkthat's a great use case to show thepower of innovation connecting peoplebut also showing authenticrepresentation and disability soI can't hear you can you hear me nowyeah okay great so I'd love to share thecode of film that you've referenced it'san amazing demonstration of how AI kindof creates a sense of connection incommunity even in the midst of thepandemicam I Kicking It Off[Music]my parents were both born deafI was notwhen people in the hearing World learnthat about me they always want to knowmore[Music]you go ahead and then go out with yourhandI've always had one foot in the deathworldin one in the hearing worldI translated a lot for my parentsit made us closernow that it's been over a year sincewe've seen each other in personcommunication is more important thaneverespecially with this guythank youwho is that alwaysit's their first time being grandparentsso they don't want to miss a singlemoment[Music]and I don't either we can't wait for youto meet him[Music]it always like gets me a little choked Istill cry every time I watch that Iwatch probably 100so Coda is such a great everyday usefamily connecting because they cannotphysically be togetherwhat are some of the specific needs ofpeople with disabilities that could beserved with AII think it's exactly what you said islooking at ways that we can betterconnect each other whether that'slanguage differences but a lot of timewith language differences you also havedisability in there as well you couldhave a cognitive disability you couldhave a learning disability you couldhaveum hearing loss you know be blind or lowvision I think AI has the power to lookat how are we solving for thosecommunities to allow them to stay betterconnected to allow them to communicateand also looking at the intersections aswell right so when you look at capturingtechnology and you look at you know livetranscribe which was built by AItechnology where you look at livetranslate right those two worlds arecoming together a great example of thatpersonally that I've I've experienced ismy my father-in-law is hard of hearingbut he only speaks Mandarin I don'tspeak Mandarin but we use livetranscribe and we use live captioningwhich does in multiple languages itallows us to communicate it allows us tostay connecting I think that's the powerthat people need to see is possible whenyou're thinking about designing in thebeginning and what can AI do to helppeople move communities forward what canthat Innovation do along with like howare you bringing visibility to differentperspectives of disability and what thatlooks like and what that representationreally means like the perfect example ofwhat we saw in the film so I want peopleto think about like what are theopportunities that wehave to advancethe way people are connecting in theworld the way people navigate lightum in a world that was not built fordisabled people I think there's so muchopportunity thereI love that and so like when you'rethinking of um even a broader set ofconsiderations how can AI be built withdifferent audiences in mind you canthink about like the older populationyou can think about gen Z like what aresome of the things that arise as weconsider some key segments or sort ofkey cohorts if you will within ourpopulation yeah well I think it'sinteresting is when you look at thedifferent Generations when you look atgen Z today for example they very muchsee disability as a core part of whothey are right they don't hide it theythink it's a very key part of youridentity along with the other ways thatthey may identify as well and when youlook at older adults right I they'rethis generation that's actually inbetween right when you look at drugexpertsfor we're the ones that are caring forour parents who are aging who are nowexperiencing disability for the firsttime we ourselves may now have adisability and now we have a youngadult's children in our life but alsohave a disability so when you'rethinking about the the demographic inthe communities and the generations thatyou're serving you're actually touchingall of them but really it's in my mind Ithink it's the genetics generation thatwe need to not forget about becausethey're touching both sides they reallyare impacting and influencing how gen zmay be interacting withum Innovation and accessibility but alsotheir aging parents so most people thinkare not as Innovative OR tech savvy butthey actually very much are and whatthose cool but young X is also the oneinfluencing those things as well butit's also helping seeing gen Z Embracefast so much which is really likehelping on the stigma side of thingslike it's helping to destigmatizedisability is not being a bad thingso when you consider a broader platformand you think about how AI can be usedto improve accessibility not just at theindividual level but more from sort oflike an infrastructure or an industryPoint of View Healthcare seems like aready place where some of this couldmanifest and be incredibly helpful whatmight that look like as you think aboutAi and what it could do and bring to thelike you know Healthcare as an industryas an example yeah I think forhealthcare there's definitely a coupleof different opportunities right it'sthe patient experience when they walkinto a doctor's office or a hospital I Iknow that during Kobe when people werewearing masks I'm a lip reader I couldnot communicate with anyone and if I gotsick and went into the doctor's officeor a hospital I didn't know what I wasgoing to do because I couldn't bringsomeone with me like that's wheretechnology like like captioning andthings like that being right there andhelping you communicate get importantinformation those are like honestlylow-hanging fruit capabilities thatcould be many to help people feel morecomfortable along with speaking adifferent language for example alsowhere I want people to think about isthe tools that AI has to allow you to dowork better easier also helps inemploying people with disabilities towork in those fields to work inhealthcare to be Healthcareprofessionals as well we're trying toincrease the disabled employment ratewhich is at 60 percent it's incrediblyhigh right not because if you put thetools that are in place in theinfrastructure in the work that they'redoing in those areas you're really goingto help people thriveand I think it sort of creates like aincreased likelihood that it's just seenas normal that's correct and it's just away for you know for someone to work ina specific manner but like candefinitely be productive and contributeand so forth yeah for sure for sureum Okay so we've been talking aboutpossibilities are there any like youknow AI tends to sometimes trigger a bitof nervousness so as we think about notjust what it can do are there any watchouts are there any risks that we shouldconsider especially as we umas Google consider being bold but alsoresponsible on the AI front yeah I thinkthere's two things that we have to thinkabout and I I relate this a lot to likewhen the web first came out and here weare like 30 years later and the web isstill not totally accessible so like wehave an opportunity here to learn fromthat like how do we make sure that AIfrom the beginning and the way that it'sworking is truly accessible from the waythat you're using the tool to theexperience that you're having to what itcan do and bringing disabled people tothe table in the design process to makesure that you're thinking about thoseuse cases something that Google doesvery well and that we will continue todo I think is incredibly important andalso taking into consideration wherepeople are atum where companies are even at in theirJourney as far as when it comes todisability and and are they lookinginternally as well to set up thosethings for inclusive design work forproduct marketing for how they're goingto do their storytelling like that'sreally important too that you'rethinking about all of those areas toconnect the dots to all the way from youknow the concept to when it goes out inthe world and you're telling the storyabout your class yeah so I have to askbecause we're always thinking about notjust possibility but outcome right whenyou consider what you can do how do youmeasure success what does that look likeum you know I think you can sort ofintegrate the technology you can sort ofthink about like how we build withinclusive design in mind from youradvantage point what are some of thesuccess metrics where you're like okaythat worked that moved the dial we'relike going forward I'm curious to getyour vantage point there I think that'sa that's a hard one right it's notalways measurable but when you see theimpact of how how disabled people arenow working right had the tools thatthey need to do the job that they wantto do are able to thrive in life but Ithink it's also important to look at arethere opportunities where we were makingprogress right when I look at like deafand hard of hearing Innovation it hascome so far with with captioningtechnologyum even with how Ai and ml are workingin hearing devices these days and speechrecognition and all those thingsum we make a lot of advances in that uhbut I think we need to go broader thanthat right I think sometimes when peopleare thinking about the opportunitythey're like well I can't solve forevery disability out there but I thinkif you think about the the largersegments first and start somewhere whereand then work towardsum reaching other disabilities that youcan influence and impact and design butit's hard to measure a number right it'shard to quantify but all we can see iswe're continuing to see this populationand get bigger and bigger and bigger andget left behind so there's a bigopportunity for a brand that when theydo Embrace innovation in this spaceGoogle has done this for many years andcloud is doing it as well you get thatloyalty that understanding thatInnovation that's just reallylife-changing and really powerful likeit empowers others to want to continueto do that workand I think like it doesn't necessarilyhave to be sort of like a hard measurebut I also do think it's those softmoments that count as well yeah I meanyou watch Coda and you see that wow thisis Google me you have a family caught inthe pandemic but still that connectionand that like human moment can occur andso I put so much emphasis as well on thehuman impact and how we start to changelives for the betterum because that's tangible that's anoutcome and it definitely matters yeahum super important and I think that'swhere you can shift the fear of what AIcan do to what the opportunity is thatAI can do for people and really impacttheir lives and really move Societyforward a new community forward that'sthe responsibility we have and theopportunity we have as opposed tolooking at like oh this this scary thingI also think it's important to recognizethe bias when you're looking at Ai andhow you're reflecting what disabledrepresent education really mean we haveto be really thoughtful about that aswell and understand that betterum and be looking at that now when itcomes to likeso how does AI compare with othertechnologies that um sort of have beenin the fold in terms of addressingaccessibility Innovation is AI asgroundbreaking is it you know like howdo you sort of think about that relativeto other Technologies you might haveexplored in the past yeah I think for mebecause I've been getting accessibilityfor so long accessibility and AI havebeen around for a long long timeactually they built a lot of the toolsthat Google has for accessibility alongwith Google Cloud as well but I thinkit's just becoming accessibility itselfand a conversation it's now becomingmainstream at the same time that AI isbecoming the next big way right so we'reat like this Crossroads where thesethese two movements are coming togetherand this is where we have an opportunityto like really accelerate it forwardthere's been some incredible work overthe years but it's kind of been like anunderground thing or if you're you knowabout it because you're working it butit's not like the mainstream thing rightso I think what's exciting is peoplereally care about the impact thatthey're seeing and accessibility designand innovation has on people's lives andwe're seeing that more and more and Ireally believe that the pandemicaccelerated that because we were allfeeling it but now is the time to lookat like okay how do we take this evenfurther now that the world is payingattention AI how do we make sure wedon't leave behind these years and yearsand years of accessible Innovation withAI that has beenhappening and take it to that next levelwhich is what I'm really excited aboutand I hope that people will payattention toyeahyeah I I think there is so much so muchwork that has been done and there's somuch more that can come when you thinkabout AI are there any sort of likefuture trends that get you excited likeas you sort of you know read about someof the things that are really more insort of an incubation or like pilotstage like what's really grabbing yourattentionwell for me it's very personal rightlike definitely hearing is the space tosee a future inum something that Google has done fromthe captioning technology and and Ithink AI will just have this incrediblepossibility and Google has worked ontechnology that allows you to controlconversations and block out noise andand focus on voices like in this roomright now it is very difficult for achild to even hear each other so likewe're working really hard but thosetypes of things change people of lifelike how many of us have been in a loudrestaurant and you're just trying tohave more Commercecan't and it's it's and also there maybe people who are struggling withhearing loss and aren't out about thatyet and haven't talked about it so thenthey're cognitively draining themselvesjust trying to be a part of aconversation and feeling left out andthat's where you start getting thesocial isolation that's when you starthaving long-term impacts on health andwell-being we see this in older adultsthey've tied that back toum Alzheimer's dementia like depressionall those things that's why this thismovement I see and like how we canchange the way that people areconversing and how hearing could changebecause of AI is what I'm super superexcited aboutyeah I think that's great so you've usedthis phrase not necessarily here but I'mgoing to bring it up nothing about uswithout us can you unpack that and justhelp us understand what that means yeahI mean it's it's really thinking aboutare you making sure that you're bringinga disabled Community along and yourInnovation and your has been processedyou know accessibility is a mindset itis not a box to check right it'ssomething that you do because you knowyou have to make sure that you'reincluding everyone and I do meaneveryoneum so it's really about bringing thecommunity along looking at your your ownJourney internally as a company or thebrand and the product right when you'redesigning like who's not in the roomright and a lot of times disability isthe last one that thought about itI think we're getting to a point wherequite we need to start remembering likedisability needs to be in the roombecause disability also touches everygroup right we're the world's largestminority so when you're bringingdisabled people in the room you're alsobringing other communities as well soit's really thinking about like don'tdesign without us and we see thatexample in in the web and many thingstoday that are not accessible becausethey weren't there in the beginning togive that feedback and that and buy somethings to be thinking about yeah yeah Ithink sort of having that perspective atcreation versus trying to fix it at theback endit's so challenging on so many fronts sosorry I think my um yeah we call thatthe the band effect right like youthink you can go back and just layeraccessibility on top of it later youcan't you can't you end up spendingmillions and millions of dollars tryingto backpedal and fix something that ifyou just thought about it andinvestigating it beginningyou would have hadmoreokayum so on that note Google has done a lotof work in terms of building a body ofresources working with industryassociationsum to create an inclusive marketingaccessibilityminded toolkit called all in I just wantto make sure I give you a moment to talkabout ityeah sure like what it is because somany different companies are on theirown journey in terms of how we bringinclusive marketing consideraccessibility consider a range ofdifferent groups that areunderrepresented to the table and Ithink this is such a helpful tool andit's not just a Google thing because itwas done in partnership with so many ofthose industry associations that alsospeak to these communities understandthe sensitivity and make this authenticand true rather than sort of like aBand-Aid solution that came in too lateright right when I when I joined Googlewe had so many resources and so muchinformation but we wanted to pull themtogether into one place and we did thisin partnership with Lamont consultingwhich is a black disabled queer brandingagency to help us with disability inwith advertising agencies as well but wedecided we wanted to do with so manytimes we would hear well I don't work onit in my company because I don't knowwhere to start right so we wanted togive people a place to start that waseasy to follow that allowed them to likeget the answers and support andresources that they needed to startsomewhere opting I say start internallywhy you're disabled employees bring theminto the conversation what could theycontribute but again that put a lot ofpressure on employees that maybe they'renot in a position that they want to bethat person so if you're wanting tobuild a Playbook that really helped likeshow use cases disability 101 what isthat like helping people betterunderstand what are the opportunitieshow you do your creative I would sayeven as basic as what's the rightlanguage to use to avoid beinginsensitive coming across as offensiveand actually showing that you'reinappropriate Ally and sort of apassionate you knowum uh vested player in this community soeven something as basic as that likeI've found these resources super superhelpful yeah no we're pretty part of itand instead of keeping it for ourselvesat Google last year at cons we releasedit to the world it's available foranyone to take a look at and use thoseresources and we've had many companiesand Brands come to us and ask likequestions after like how do we do thiswork this is where we are this is how wewould love that support and we willcontinue to do that and it's been verysuccessful and useful I think it justtook a company realizing they had thedata and the information and they justwanted to share it to give people astarting pointone of the things I would just flag hereis while it touches on accessibility ittouches on Race on gender on so manydifferent areas even just thinking aboutlike are you disproportionatelyrepresenting the population as veryyoung when people are of different agecohorts so there's a lot of informationthere I found it so helpfulum even you know on in my journey toappreciate like as a as a marketingperson as a creative are we creating inan inclusive manner manner or such thatpeople can see themselves in the workand that we're creating content that'sreflective of the audiences that weserve so this is such a great tool Ijust wanted to make sure um to plug it[Music]"
