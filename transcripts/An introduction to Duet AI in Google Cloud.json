VijayKrishnan from touring in a few minutesand we're here to tell you all aboutsome of the details in Duet now many ofyou probably saw some of this in thekeynote we're going to try to click intoa few more of the interactions and showyou what we have today and available foryou to go try and sign up for preview atany minute at the blog post and our webpages have those sign up linkssoagain this whole conference you're goingto hear a little bit of repetition aboutwhere we are with AI I think it'simportant to recognize that theseproducts are still being built onessentially a moving train of innovationso what you see today in Duet is goingto sort of climb this ladder from 2023and Beyond right what we have today isjust the beginningand the other thing I'll point out isthat while at Google there are thesecore r d resources we fundamentally havetwo different areas where we're exposinggenerative AI one to to our largeconsumer base and the other is to ourEnterprise and business users and withinthat we have the two areas of vertex andduet and really the way I summarize thisis vertex is a platform you for you allto be a producer of value usinggenerative AI in your own products andservices and duet is a place for you toconsume the value of USspending that time and effort buildinglook at a sort of typical pitch slidefor vertex and where you can use vertextoday it is really in any Cloud verticalor industry or any I'm sorry anybusiness that you can imagine you haveconsumers who want to benefit from aneasier or more intelligent experienceand what we've done at Google cloud isrecognize that we are in a business andthat business is cloud services and sowe have customers trying to you know useand be more effective in Cloud so whenyou look at a generative AI solutionit's going to involveumbe back hereand we've done this because we recognizethat cloud continues to not be verysimple I mean I've personally been inthe public Cloud space about 10 yearsand I know that while we continue tomake some things easier we continue toadd more products and more services wehave over 100 in Google Cloud platformitself and so new people new newemployees at your own companies areconstantly looking at a new set ofchallenges to solve on cloudand so how can we make that easierand so with dual AI we're reallyreimagining the way you interact withthe cloud interfaces we provide you thisincludes things like the IDE fordevelopers or own cloud consolesspecialized data interaction Servicessecurity products Etcand duet AI today well it covers aportion of Google Cloud's products andservices really in the fullness of timewould be the entire gcp experience you'dhave duet following along throughout itand so when you look at any generativeAI solution it's literally sort of builton a stack of capabilities and that'swhat we have done here so we've startedwith Google's own research anddevelopment models such as palm2we are then using some of our highperformanceplatform infrastructure in vertex to dothe model tuning and servingwe've then taken our industryinformation and informed the model withadditional context of gcp so thisincludes things like our documentationour client libraries our sample codethis is now becoming an expert systemfor gcpin the future our next step is to allowyou to bring your own Enterprise andorganizational fine-tuning to thesemodels and make it truly your ownspecific instance of duetand then finally The Last Mile mattersthe user experience is something we'veput a lot of investment in for duet tomake sure that it's intuitive and easyto use out of the box this is notsomething that you need to be any kindof an AI expert to take away the valueof duetso let's go through a couple of thesesort of principles of what we're lookingto build long term first is we try toinfuse the context of what you'reworking on directly into the model'sawareness today this is specificallyaround the code that you're working onor perhaps the data tables you'reworking with but there is a sort of avast amount of additional context we'regoing to be able to inform the model ofover timeum this is integrated into the platforminterfaces and experiences this isn'tsomething that is bolted on or you haveto switch to a different tab to usewe really want to then move to makingthis more agent based over time right sothat not only will you be able to kindof get the expert advice and guidanceand suggestions that you can today butyou can work with duet to make plans ofaction to manage and operate yourservices more collaboratively andfinallymost uses of cloud involve some longerJourneys let's say you're going tomigrate a set of services to the cloudthis isn't something you do and sit downand do in one hour session this is ajourney that you want duet to go withyou along the whole journeyall right so todaytoday this includes assisted developmentassisted operations assisted dataassisted no code development andassisted security and I'll be walkingthrough each of theseso let's start with assisted developmentand we're going to imagine Sam who's adeveloper software engineer at acommercial website and he's using visualcode he's relatively new to Google Cloudso he's he's familiar with thedevelopment he wants to achieve but he'sstill new to Googleand really we have these two primaryways in which he can interact with duetthe first is as a pair programmer doingcode completion and code suggestionsdirectly in line as he's writing code inhis editor and the other is through aninteractive chat component in the IDEa soas he's writing code duet will Autosuggest completions of functions it'llsuggest things like Imports into yourIDEit will help take comments you mightwrite in code and turn those into fullyimplemented functionsand it's specifically good at knowinggcp Services right so the accuracy iseven higher when it comes to using ourown apis because of the specializedtuning we've donethings in languages where the ID doesn'tdo it for you such as Auto importingmodules is something that depending onthe language duet can do for youand lastly this idea of being moreproductive as a developer isn't alwaysabout writing the code it's often aboutunderstanding the code base you're beingdropped into on a new project so thereare lots of of projects where thecomplexity of the code is the firstdeveloper problem to solve likeunderstanding what came before you andso you can now highlight code and askduet to explain it to you in plainEnglishand we are also releasing as part of ourinitial release the ability to do thingsthat are pure toil for most developerssuch as writing unit tests I reallydon't know any developer who thinks thatwriting unit test is the favorite partof the jobnow one of the things we're doingthroughout generative AI Google istrying to help provide visibility andtie back to where we understand thegenerative I AI has learned something itis suggesting for code that means whenthere is a specific enough literal matchto a generated snippet we highlight theoriginal training source and thelicenses associated with that trainingdata this gives you the sort ofattestation you need to apply your owndecisions about how you're managinggenerated code or license management andlets you go back and double checkwhether or not you want to use somethingsay that we found on a web page or froma repo that had no license attached toitand this gives you sort of a an abilityto trust what code you're using fromgenerative AI directly in your projectsso to talk a little bit about more aboutduet AI assisted development I'm goingto bring Vijay on stageto talk about his work at touring[Applause]wait thank you presidentlet me first tell you what we do attuning so at a tuning we have helpedover a thousand companies andparticularly a hundred large Enterprisesand we help companies in two differentways one is we help companies with fullymanaged software projects and the otherthing we help companies with isbuilding a remote distributed teams ofprivated Developersso our talent Cloud allows rapidscaling of high quality teams and thethis is heavily possible as a result ofthree factors first we have a reallylarge planetary pool of softwaredevelopers over 2 million softwaredevelopers from 100 plus countries inevery possible time zone and Countryimaginablesecond we thoroughly test developers intechnical skills in various Tech Stacksprogramming skills soft skills andLeadership skills and so onand this in turn allows us to build avery detailed profile of developers itallows us to build good machine learningalgorithms to umfind the right developer for variousjobs and needless to say because we havecast such a wide net we we cover everypossible skill stackindustry domain Etc are possiblebut that said team building is one isone part of what of the goal theultimate goal of course is to ensurethat we are able to produce a lot ofvalue for our clients at the lowestpossible costs and that's where duetcomes inso at during we we constantly aspire tohelp our software development teamsproduce the maximum value for ourclients and toward this particular endwe we've been doing a mixture of bothbuilt and buy where we have been lookingat the best tools out there in themarket that can help software developerteams produce more and we've also beenlooking closely at various things weshould be building ourselves that themarket is not organically producingso over here we it was helpful that westarted with the gcp uh workstationbecause uh that meant we couldeffectively operate within uhGoogle's environment uh profit from allthe functionality at our disposal weumand uh the result has been that ourdevelopers have loved what they haveseen in terms ofthe autocomplete and what it does totheir specific productivity and ourdevelopers have also anecdotallyreported that they love the the chatinterface and what that does for them byway of their productivitybut that said we we wanted to put aconcrete number on this like we we wantto over time be the place where ourdevelopers are producing more and morevalue per unit uh time and that's why wesubjected this to a more specificmeasurementso we uh so we run an experiment withthe duet and this is one of the fewexperiments uh that we cite here butall our different experiments have moreor less yielded similar results where wedirectly measured pull request mergersand saw a 33 increase inas a result of a dueter Ai and ourexperiments are also fairlyrepresentative because we have a team ofsoftware developers that do variousdifferent things we have I mean we havepeople doing front-end back-end uhmobile app development data scientistsmachine learning Engineers everything sothis is a nicely representative pool ofuh of software developers andtells us what a duet can doone more thing for which we we see someearly evidence that we are trying tobetter quantify also is the importanceof training and the the additionalproductivity lift that comes whendevelopers fully understand what thesetools can do for them so there's acertain kind of productivity gain onemight achieve with a typical use likesuppose they were the developers were tocontinue coding on a certain day uh theway they were coding their day beforethere's a certain lift one can hope toachieve through uh but obviously changesin coding Behavior like writing a moredetailed comment and allowing the toolto generate more code for you or usingthe chat functionality more uh widelyall these things are behavioral changesthat could lead to even larger gains sowe we are also actively engaged intraining our developer pool to um mosteffectively leverage these toolsforeignwe we are certainly taking a look atcode base indexing and debuggingum and uh yeah but both of thesewe expect willpush us further along toward our goal ofa accelerated delivery as well as ourgoal to improve developer search andrecommendation capabilitiesback to you Prestonthank you Vijay thanks for yourpartnership in in helping us developduet it was immensely helpfulso we're going to be continuing to movepretty quickly here because we've got alot more to show about what duet can doalready today in gcp and we're going totalk now about assisted operations nowOps as a term I want you to understandthat anyone who's using any product inthe console in this sense is reallysomebody who's operating the gcp thisisn't strictly limited to those whomight be in sort of the classic op sideof a devops type definition this isreally something that we think can helpacross many uses in our console todayfor all gcp products and so the first isreally like understandingum in a quick and in context way whatour products can do how they areconfigured how to use them this isessentially bringing the vastinformation embedded in an entiredocumentation into the console andsummarizing just what you need when youneed it and then the other is to helpbring more curated experiences for howto bestact on certain recommendations ordebugging type situations in the consoleso let's go through these pretty quicklynow this is in some ways maybe thesimplestbut AI but it is perhaps more powerfulproducts where at the time you're tryingto figure something out you realize youneed to answer a question for yourselfthat's probably somewhere in thedocumentation and so you leave theexperience where you are settingsomething up and you have to go off andfind which page in the documentation hasthe answer even which section in thedocumentation page has the answer andmaybe it's actually spread acrossseveral different pages so with duet AIyou can simply ask your question andplain English and we will summarize andgive you in some bullet point formexactly what it is you need to know whatyou maybe need to do and that is anincredible Time Saverum the other is that we have right inour console an interactive cln and CLIenvironment called Cloud shell and whatcan suggest to you certain actions orcommands to perform in that shellenvironment while still retainingwhatever contacts you have in the restof the consolethe other is thatlook across things like a given logentry help you understand what ishappening from a given set of errortexts so we have the ability to look atlog line explanationsyou can do further investigation andbecause the duet model is not simplybased only on gcp knowledge but it isbased on a general purpose largelanguage model you can extend this intoother errors such as you know tell mesomething about an HTTP error code tellme about something around even athird-party product where might beyou're integrating or sending data fromfor example here if I'm looking at errorcodes in this case I have a recurringerror with something wrong with my useof the twilio API right and so here I'mgetting suggestion of how to potentiallyfix that error that I'm seeing in mycloud error reporting screenlet's look at assisted data now I'lltell you something I've I've been a youknow a technical practitioner in varioustimes in my rolling cloud and I'm stillnot very good at SQL I can sort of likeeek around with itum so I'm personally very excited aboutthis feature right so as a as a dataanalyst maybe a junior data analyst ormaybe somebody new to a certain sort ofdata sethow can I have duet help accelerate mysort of time to the task that I'm tryingto achieve in something like bigqueryand so here I'm going to mention thatwe're providing direct contacts thecontext we're really making available iswhat data sets are you working withwhich ones are available and what schemacolumn names and data types are in thosetableswhich means that when I'm asking duet tosort of suggest a completion for me forSQL it's doing so in a syntax accurateway that knows about my data and soagain it's having that same type of IDElikeahead Auto suggestion for you directlyin the bigquery consolenow it can also use natural language soI I may not know I for example I mightknow what types of business entities arein my data set but I'm not sure exactlywhich tables or which columns those arein I'm trusting that the column namesprobably are similar enough to what I'mlooking for so the ability to write inplain English what type of query I'mlooking for and have it just simplygenerate whole cloth the SQL I need tofind that information is somethingthat's incredibly useful for somebodywho maybe is not working with thatparticular data set day in and day outand I can use iteration in the sense ofcontinuing to evolve that query andrefine it over time and that's reallythat how we think about duet as acollaborator this isn't simply going todo the final job for you it's helpingyou achieve the job even fasterand last lastly if I'm working with ateam and somebody else you can savequeries and reuse them in bigquery so ifI'm using a shared project wheresomebody else has written a query and Idon't quite know how to understand whatthat query is doing I can ask duet toexplain that to me in plain English andso this idea of working with naturallanguage and SQL back and forth issomething that makes duet AI for datapractitioners incredibly powerfulall right let's talk briefly about theno code experience now I understand manyof you may be primarily gcp platformusers but with app sheet we have a lotof opportunity for colleagues or evenyourself to work and build sort ofsimple Frontline internal business lineapplications with a a complete statementright so like from one statement you candescribe the app this provides theability to build the entire app sheetapp including UI and everything you needin sort of one shotand so you'll be able to use the promptdescribe what you want achieved knowingwhat data is available and it willgenerate the app for you and so for formany applications I think we allrecognize that building from scratchfrom code building an HTTP rest API Etcisn't necessary for for many of the kindof day-to-day little applications weneed throughout our businessesand it's really that fastall right let's talk about security andagain this is not something where weexpect Security Professionals to go awaythis is actually for SecurityProfessionals to be more productive intheir work or to help people who are upand coming Security Professionals to beimmediately more capable and more beingable to contribute to a greater degreein their environmentsso let's start withum we're going to go ahead and jump andstart to talk about what Intel doesmandiant haveand so I want to see the latest threatactivity impacting my industry so I'llcheck mandian threat intelligence thisis a tool that provides thousands andthousands of reports that can be lookedthrough and searched and read eachreport is an incredibly detaileddocumentbut if I'm looking for this apt-43 sortof threat domain I don't really want tolook through 11 000 search results so Ican use duet to summarize those topsearch results and let me understandreally what is this thing about withouthaving to go dig deep into each of thesereportsso I can see the content recognize whatthis is uh what kind of exposure thismight be providing my company to and Ican move on to another toolyepuh in chronicleso in chronicleum I've gotten some Intel that we havethis this potential crypto miningexposure and normally to connect thesearch and Chronicle I'd have to use avery uh very verbose uh domain-specificlanguage called udm Fields there aremany thousands of the kind of syntaxtokens in this security search languageto look for events in chronicle and sowith duet I can use it tosorry I can use this to basicallyconstruct my Search terms and find thoseevents more quickly and I can run thatsearch and surface those eventsumto determine what next steps I want totake without having to spend as muchtime constructing the queryfinally once I know what some of thepotential exposure is I can switch tosecurity Command Centerand see that we actually have some ofthe vulnerabilities in this cryptomining attack surfaced so normally tounderstand this I'd have to understandyou know I'd have to open the findingI'd have to look at the specific detailsof the finding in the fields and thenI'd have to check the Jsonrepresentation of that vulnerability foreven more finding details but here withduet I can get a plain English summaryI don't know why I'm getting this butthat tells me essentially what is thenature of the event you know includingwhy there's an issue and what I can doabout itand finally I can look at some of theum I'm going to move to the graph hereso there's a graph representation of mycloud resources this is a really richdrill down tool that I can go throughthe graph to find what sub resourcemight be involved in this vulnerabilitybut duet AI generates a summary of whatcan be vulnerableand what I can do about it basicallyshort circuiting a longer investigativeprocess for me to kind of drill downright to where the asset of the resourceI need to manage differently is in thatsystemso let's talk about why duet is anEnterprise ready system and this isbecause it is built on the sameprinciples ofsegmenting and isolating your data fromother customer data the way we've builtall gcp products right this is somethingyou've heard Thomas mention Point Blankright away in the keynote the data suchas the code context or the data schemacontext you're sending to duet modelsare never stored or persisted or used byGoogle in any sort of additionaltraining waywe conform to a set ofAI principles in the way we are buildingduet so that we put in things likesafety checks and responses meaning weare bringing some of Google's own AIprinciples around hateEtc and so you cannot use duet forexample to write a script to generateumsort of very hateful speech for examplenow we'll be allowing people to tunesome of these checks over time but thisis is part of what is built into theproduct todayit's kind of a word wall so I might kindof go past this one but this is reallyaround how we are going to allow this tobring you the customized trainingrespecting these same principles nowthough this isn't something we havetodaybut this would be the idea that asyou're bringing your organization's owncustom Corpus of codeother information about other datasources or even operational playbooksthat will all be unique to yourorganization and essentially managedwithin your own gcp perimeterenvironmentthrough these sort of custom adapterlayerslet's talk a little bit about wherewe're going next and again this isactually sort ofum really just a scratch on the surfaceof all the things we have in mind tobring to duetso today in the assisted developmentwe've got as I showed you the codecompletion license attribution vs codejetbrain support is already outavailable in um in early previewthe multi-code the multi-turn chat isavailable as part of today's preview invs code it will be coming soon tojetbrainsand then later this year we're going tobring a set of Rich admin controls I'llexplain this once you'll see it in someof the other areas but this is going tobe how you enable access to certain duetfeatures for the workforce by role typeor maybe you want to turn on or offglobally access to a certain duetfeature that will all be part of theadmin control systemfor the operator today againit's that small but super valuablefeature of of summarizing theinformation you need to know where youneed to know it and again I think thiswill persist as being one of duet's mostoften used features because itrepresents essentially the entirety ofthe platforms documentation and usagefor every single Cloud product alreadytodayuh we'll be looking at more integratedexperiences into the troubleshootingexperience and especially as we bringthe ability to bring greater degrees ofcontext around what's happening in yourservices and applications on the cloudto duet to help be a co-troubleshooterto determine root cause type problemsmore quicklyand then in the assisted dataexploration we have uha lot going on with building models andusing ml in the context of your dataright so this is things like bqml andbeing more helpful or informed about howto collaborate in building the ml withthe ml now this is not the kind ofsci-fi one model building another fromfrom llm point of view this is reallytaking the power of ml in the dataand using duet to help you build thoseapplications and scenarios moreeffectivelyacross the thesecurity products we're looking to bringgreater natural language search creationso if you have a more complex scenariothat you're trying to do research onthat you want to talk to be able to typeinto a prompt these tools will allowthatsimpler natural language rule creationfor for ongoing monitoringand then the ability to find and detectuh novel vulnerabilities and assured OSSpackagesno Code and low code this will be sortof rolling out directly in app sheet tomany customers over the next few monthsinteractive explanations can helpessentially bring apps to to make themmore updatable right now they're sort ofthe app creation phase but there isn'tthe opportunity to iterate and refinethat application so that ability toiterate and derive either variants orimprovements on existing applications iswhat we're looking for nextall right so preview is available todayyou should be able to find what you needto sign up for that through the blogpost or through our web page we'veactually worked very hard over the lastweek to make this very expedited if youhad earlier been part of our trustedtester programum you know that we were letting only insort of trickles of people at a time sowe hope to be opening this up over timemuch more widely so we encourage you allto sign upand in in the products themselves butremember I talked a lot about how we'vebuilt a lot of user experience sort ofpolished into duet today that includeshow to get your feedback so we havethings like when you get a SQL generatedsample you can give us an immediatethumbs up thumbs down did that work ordid that not work you can send usfeedback about code responses and andwe're looking at all of that this isreally going to be an ongoingcollaboration this is an emerging spacewe all know that generative AI as it istoday is still relatively new to thescene we all know that things likehallucinations and Imperfections andaccuracy are going to be par for thecourse but I can tell you watching thisover the last three to six monthsthis is changing so quickly that this issomething you really want to integrateinto your workflows today and begin tounderstand where this is applicableright now and that way you are best setup to understand as it evolves how to bemost effective with it as we continue tobuild sort of week by week and month bymonth improvementsso thank you all for comingover the next coming weeks thank youthank youforeign"
