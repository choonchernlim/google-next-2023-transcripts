andpersonalization today we have two reallygreat panelists from Google cloud andfrom Salesforce to allow them tointroduce themselves hey everyone myname is Narendra Singh I am VP ofproduct for Salesforce data Cloud happyto be here I've been in the enterprisesoftware space for the last 20 plusyears and my focus area is around bigdata analytics Ai and specificallybuilding applications for CRM domain andI'm happy to be here and joined by Sethhere everyone hi I'm Seth Siciliano Iwork in the Google Cloud Allianceorganization I've been here for about 14years at Google Cloud before it wasactually called Google Cloud I shouldsay but always in the customer andpartner facing roles today I run theSalesforce Alliance relationship for usso I'm very much passionately focused onworking together with our externalpartners and looking for ways to bringenhanced customer value to the marketand so thank you so much for comingtoday hope you guys find some good valueout of this session and look forward toitso we're going to start with the vendorwho's going to give us a really greatupdate on all the work and Innovationthat we're doing right now withSalesforce yepokay thank you we have to skip a fewslides okay let's get to thethere you go slide okay thanks so uh aspart of Salesforce data Cloud right it'san integral part of customer 360platform which gives you an ability tobuild a unified customer 360 athyperscale with which you can combineyour Salesforce data and external dataall into one unified view to power ourcustomer 360 applications which weprovide to the market to a sales cloudservice Cloud marketing Cloud CommerceCloud it's a way for you to drive aconsistent cohesive intelligentexperience backed by the data put in ourcustomer 360 platform now as part ofthat story we have a lot of data as partof our CRM applications which is createdwithin the Salesforce ecosystem but aswe work with large Enterprise customersthere's a lot of data beyond the theSalesforce ecosystem as well sittingwith platforms like like Google platformlast year we announced partnership withsnowflake especially for that veryreason and now we're extending thatpartnership with with Google so that wecan get you an easy way in which you canthen extend the full customer 360capabilities with data which is now alsositting in the Google ecosystem and thisis the joint Innovation that we aredelivering to the market around threekey pillars it's about data integrationit's a modern way of data integrationit's about how you can get more valueout of your AI Investments you have donewith the Google platform as well asbeing able to seamlessly activate thedata not only within the customer 360and our applications but also over tothe channels and and the services andthe the analytics capabilities that youhave within the Google platform what isthe the whole value it's all about sothat we can help you get more richerinsights can get you to act on your datafaster with more timely and richerinsights as well as being able to helpyou drive more meaningful businessoutcomes through the activation of thedata with all of the unified data that'ssitting also in Salesforce ecosystem aswell as what you have within your GoogleCloud platformnow now what are the key Innovationswe're delivering as part of thispartnership there are two parts to itthe first part is what we call bringyour own uh lake with zero ATL sharingso this is the zero ETL data sharingInnovation that we're delivering withbigquery and what it provides is is amodern way in which you can integratethe data you can unify the data sittingin Google platform within Googlebigquery it's a bi-directionalintegration so all of your data sittingwithin Google we query without any zeroATL you can connect that into Data Cloudto build richer customer 360. at thesame time you can take all of the datasitting within the Salesforce ecosystemand seamlessly share it into the GoogleCloud for you to be able to do any kindof analytics and activation use caseswithin the the power of the the Googlecloud services and the next keycapability we're delivering is bringyour own AI again this is our part ofour vision here how we become open andextensible and with that capability wegive you an ability to bring your owncustom models built with Google vertexas your choice of EI platform andseamlessly activate those models to makeinferences which says data Cloud so thatthen you can drive that use them fordriving richer insights hyperpersonalization and decisioning withinthe customer 360 applicationsnow why are we doing this right we areat this interesting point right withrespect to the macro economicenvironment that we're facing thatbusinesses are all needing to do moreright and there are key key ways inwhich they're trying to achieve thiswith their existing Investments rightthey have existing data sitting withindifferent platforms they need a way inwhich they can unify that with that theycan get a lot ofsavings with respect to the ID spendsthis is a leading research thatindicates like unified data saves like60 of the ID investors because I.T tendsto invest a lot of time going intobuilding these data integration ETLpipelines maintaining them and AI ishelping to to reduce cost because thathelps to drive more of automation whichincreases productivity as a result butthe key thing that is at the heart of itis having the connected data as a wayfor you to power more smarter AI moreintelligent AI to drive more automationso how do we get to thatbut at the same time we are having moredata than ever being created beingcreated through multiple channelsthrough multiple applications webapplications mobile applications theyall have separate identity you have yourloyalty data you have your productpurchase data you have your health andfitness data you have your engagementdata and you have service and supportdata all of this data is more datagetting created than ever and and thekind of data that is left by as adigital footprint by the customers isgrowing by volume every year and at afaster clip than ever so that introducesa significant complexity in terms ofbeing able to manage that and it'stoday's tend to spend a significantamount of time in just being able tointegrate and manage these Integrationsmoving data from one use case to anotheruse case could be analytics use casecould be a recommendation use case couldbe a bi use case and being able to thenput that together into the line ofbusiness application to be able to drivethat last mile interaction which ispersonalized and we want to be able togive you a solution to which you don'tneed to do that and you get a moderncapability through which you are able topersonalize this now customerexperiences at the same time there's arising expectation from the customerside of the house that their intent andtheir preferences are known and andcustomers are given a hyper personalizedexperiences in terms of what productservice or that is going to best fittheir need so you have a moment in timethat you understand their intent makethe right product recommendation or givethem a right solution in terms of whatproduct that they have bought in thepast which is going to serve or addresstheir customer issue but customers rightnow have as part of a study found wellover hundreds of application close tothe Thousand applications through whichthey are capturing all of their customerdata now customers with all of this dataand growing amount of data they need aplatform with which they can combine allof the data they can bring it in theycan bring it in in in real time at scaleto be able to meet the customersexpectation of having those as perslides real-time interactions which aredriven at scale so how do you do thatpersonalization and that's why weinvested in building Salesforce dataCloud this is the the hyperscalecustomer platform that we provide aspart of our customer 360 with which nowyou can connect all of your Enterprisedata the data that you sit withinSalesforce ecosystem and SalesforceBeyond Salesforce ecosystem with whichyou can now ingest that data you caneven connect to that data you can thenharmonize the data into a shape in aschema that abstracts you away in termsof what that data comes from aparticular Source into a canonicalrepresentation with which then you canget a unified profile with a fullcustomer 360 degree view on top of whichthen you can drive all of your customer360 applications for engagement with thepower of analytics Ai and what we calldata actions being built into our dataplatform and what does AI AI help herewith the Richer customer 360 degree viewyour AI gets smarter your AI gets betterwith the power of the activation andanalytics you are able to thenunderstand the full customer journey interms of how they are buying whatthey're buying where they're buying whatkind of service issues are they facingand and with the data actions you areable to act on that data in real time todrive your processes and orchestrationwithin the customer 360. in terms of anykind of employee facing engagement whereyou've seen that a certain lead or anopportunity needs to be now you knowhanded over to a particular employee whoneeds to engage with the customer orthere's a certain support issue thatneeds to be escalated or a customercoming to a self-service portal needs tosearch for a certain issue you want tobe able to make them relevantrecommendations there and the thirdpillar is about data data cloud is allabout being open and extensible beingopen and extensible we truly recognizehow we want to be able to connect todata which sits beyond the the boundaryof the sales force being able to connectto data setting within Google platformwith with capabilities of bring your ownWarehouse or bring your own Lake andbring your own modeland that is the key premise with whichwe ship Salesforce data Cloud as kind ofthe intelligent heart of the thecustomer engagement and specificallywith Google bigquery you get thesecapabilities to create a single viewwith the unified data with zero ETLapproach what it provides you it givesyou a bi-direction capability with whichnow you can seamlessly share databetween the two systems betweenSalesforce data cloud and Googlebigquery you can create much richerprofiles with the data sitting in yourbigquery data warehouse imagine yourbilling data or your or your webengagement data or your loyalty datasitting in there you know you can youcan simply connect to that data andbuild a richer customer profile and thatdata is accessed in in like a near reallife kind of connectivity in real timeto build those richer insights as partof your customer 360 View and vice versawith the data and the Richer unifiedcustomer profiles built in theSalesforce data Cloud the same unifiedprofile with all of the data in terms oftheir sales sales engagement serviceengagements web engagements is availableas part of Google bigquery to be able toshare with the broader set of analyticsServices through which now you can drivemore meaningful analytics Ai and anykind of activation driven through theGoogle platform using that integrationand at the end of the day it helps youto reduce your operational cost and itgives you a way in which you can reducethe infrastructure needs which goes interms of doing the traditional ETLIntegrations and the latency that comesas a processand this feature is going to go pilot aswith the upcoming October release andwe'll be doing it early next year in theFebruary monthnow how it works underneath is datacloud has these capabilities in terms ofingestion and connecting to the data sowe both offer both modalities throughwhich you can bring the data in batchand in streaming fashion in real timewithin Salesforce data Cloud on top ofthat we have added a capability withbring your own Warehouse to connectdirectly to bigquery tables and createthem as live external tables and all ofthat data then gets harmonized into acanonical shape using the data modelwithin csforce data Cloud next all ofthe data with that comes from differentdata sources with disparate identitiesgets unified into a unified customerprofile and once you have built thatunified customer profile with its fulldata graph with all the the customerdata surrounding that unified identityyou are able to then do analytics and AIon top of it and this analytics could bein the form if you want to be able tocreate a 360 degree view with a specificpropensity prediction using the Einsteincapabilities in the Salesforce datacloud or you want to be able to Target acohort of customers through a segment interms of a certain set of customers whoare purchased interested in purchasing acertain product in a certain region fora certain period of time those kind ofsegments and cohorts you can drive andcreate those out of Data Systems datacloud or you can use it for bi with thepower of the Tableau being able to dofull reporting and visualization on topof it and you can act on all of thisdata as the data is coming in as theseinsights are getting created this datacan be acted on within the customer 360platform by creating business flows bycreating your marketing Journeys andalso you can create external kind ofIntegrations through the power of dataactions which can act as the data iscoming in or as the Insight is happeningwithin our system at the level of asingle customer in a single profile theybrowse the web they browse a particularproduct page a certain number of timesor they have a certain propensity to buya certain product because that's an AIrecommendation that we have from oursystem all of these can be triggered asactions to orchestrate the downstreamprocesses and the third capability nowyou get with this partnership is what wecall the data sharing with data sharingall of the data that is within theSalesforce data Cloud can now beconnected and shared without doing anyETL directly with the Google bigquerywhere these objects that exist as datawithin Salesforce data Cloud will be nowavailable as native objectsnow with Einstein studio built on thedata Cloud we have full capability to beable to do the point and click basedEinstein models through propensityrecommendations at the same time withthe bring your own model approach withvertex now we have the ability for youto build your custom expert models buildit with the power of the zero ATL datasharing that you can deploy train anddeploy in vertex and then you canregister them in data Cloud to makeinferencesand with this feature it gives you a wayin which now you can seamlessly trainyour models with the data sitting in theSalesforce data Cloud you canoperationalize them within Google vertexand use them then to make inferences toprovide richer decisioning andpersonalization as part of your yourcustomer 360 platform which can be usedacross all of your applications and thisfeature is going to go ga in October aswellnow in terms of the car the use cases aswe've been talking to a lot of customerswe have significant amount of use casesthat we are talking to these customersacross all the verticals uh whether it'scpg and Retail where they want to beable to combine their CRM data they wantto be able to combine their advertisingdata to be able to understand theircohorts of segments to be able toachieve better results in terms of thethe targeting for their campaigns andconversions and and optimize their adspend same thing happening with a lot ofTelco customers we're talking we have alot of billing and usage data sitting inin Google Cloud that they want to beable to use to be able to drive targetedpromotions cross-sell upsellopportunities as well as intensivesector as we're talking to thesecustomers they have a lot of theirfinancial transaction data combined withtheir CRM data they want to be able touse that for this for identifyingopportunities tied to how they want tobe able to optimize their cash theirspend or their their financialpromotionsnow underneathwe have how this works is that we havebuilt a zero ATL architecture Based On AStorage level Federation for sharingdata from data Cloud to to bigqueryunderneath we have our tables created inin an open storage format which getsshared with bigquery and once you are inbigquery you receive an incoming shareas part of your analytics Studio toaccept it and that creates a data setand the data set can then becomesvisible for you to run your jointqueries seamlessly as part of yourbigquery ah and console and that canalso run the queries which can bejoining bigquery data obviously Sourcedata and you're able to then get thecombined insightsand with respect to the reverse partwhich is about how do you bring bigquerydata into Salesforce data Cloud thetables that exist in bigquery can bemounted as external objects seamlesslywithin Salesforce data Cloud which canthen be used to to augment the thecustomer 360 data model imagine you haveyour your billing data your usage datathose can be mounted as objects withinour systems and they become part of thecustomer 360 data graph on top of whichall of our processes in terms ofinsights profiles segments andactivations can seamlessly run to giveyou the full experience end to end interms of the capabilities of thecustomer 360 platformand with that I've given you a quickoverview in terms of what thatcapability is and what it provides andwith that I'll hand it over to to cat totalk about our next set of questions shehas in mind yeah sure so I thought wecould take a little bit of time to sortof Deep dive a little bit more now thatyou have a little bit of context a bigoverview of what we're doing togetherand kind of reiterate maybe some of thethemes that you shared with us alreadynarender so there's definitely been alot of news and there's going to be morenews coming as to what our both of ourcompanies are doing and one thing Iwould love to get your thoughts on isaround this great momentum that'sstarting to build and what kind of valueis it starting to really unlock for ourcustomersyeah so like I said talking back to theuse cases we're hearing from ourcustomers it's all about has beentalking to these customers right they'retwo things that they're trying to seethey have existing investments in Googleplatform where they have a lot ofcustomer data that is sitting there andthey're looking as ways in which theycan connect to the data at the same timeget the value of the data so a Telcocustomer like I said who's have theirtheir billing data and and their usagedata like typically a lot of call volumelog data sits in there which they wantto be able to use as a way to understandwhat kind of promotions are more suitedto drive these customers so so it's allabout having the ability to build this360 degree view with this data with thisdata and insights imagine that you havean insights for a churn prediction aswell sitting with the Google platformthrough the vertex platform they'vebuilt they are able to seamlessly accessthat as well and all of these abilitiescan can then be used to enrich thecustomer 360 based on which then theycan be powering an email campaign amarketing campaign or they could bepower covering a customer experience interms of a promotional offer that theywant to be able to show to the customerwhen they log in into their self-serviceportal so it's all about how thesecustomers can make it really easy get totheir investment integrate the data andbeing able to then get the full mileagein terms of taking that experience todeliver the Last Mile in terms of the360 with the experience that we havehereyeah I was adding on to what narendermentionedum you know Google and Salesforce havebeen Partners probably since 2017officially but really the accelerationof our partnership has just picked upamazing Steam and momentum over the lastyear and it's it's really centeredaround these types of solutions they'reanchored into core areas of data and AInarender talked about investment and andwe think about that at Google Cloud alot of the same way we look at our jointcustomers and we say for for a lot ofyears Salesforce and Google have shownup in different rooms at different timesto the same customer saying slightlyaligned but slightly misaligned storiesand pitches and value propositions tothose customers and those customers havein turn made significant Investments Ilike the word narender used Investmentsthey made significant investments intime Technology Energy and quite franklyfinancial investments in both stacks andso one of the things that we at GoogleCloud are really excited about is thispartnership and this momentum over 2023for us is really about tying thoseInvestments together that they've madein Salesforce that our customers havemade in Google and trying to drive moreout of that investment for thosecustomers trying to give them more valueout of what they've placed and Trust inGoogle and Salesforce and then sharethat whether it's a 360 view whetherit's increased analyticsplatforms within bigquery or the 360view for a marketing campaign withinSalesforce we want those customers toget more value out of those Investmentsand we're really anchored on providingthose value opportunities to ourcustomers in everything we're doingmoving forwardso I know that we've been talking a lotabout Data customer data really beingfundamental important now with AI that'sbecoming even more crucial and so wouldlove to get your thoughts on how arethese Technologies really improving thenotion around customer experience whatthat meansyeah so at the heart of it right thefirst problem we are trying to solve isis kind of what we call data unificationand making it really easy to unify thedata and why we were doing this is themore data you have the better youunderstand and know your customers rightthat's the first premise with which weare starting and that's where we want toextend the reach out in terms of allplaces where the customer data can liveand and at the same time make it easyand simple and second premise is thatonce you have more data and and aunified customer profile around whichyou understand the full customer journeyand the customer life cycle now you cando much better AI on top of it rightthat's the nextstep with which we make AI more smarterwe make AI more efficient and this is acontinuous thing that keeps on happeningright this is not happening one time asas things are changing and data ischanging on the Google side data ischanging on the Salesforce side this iscontinuously kind of enriching and andupdating that customer profile and alongwith that continuously AI is makinginferences that's the other big part ofthis integration that this AI as it isintegrated with bring your own modelthis inference and continuouslyhappening as the data is changing andcontinuously enriching the profilefurther and as we are doing that thedownstream what we call the activationand the actioning that is happening ontop of it within all of our applicationsacross you know full customer 360 so itthat's what is driving even betterengagement and on top of those those weare trying to build more and moreintelligent out of the box experienceswith which we can light up this valueout of the box for our customersyeah I'm always amazed at the amount ofcompanies that now label themselves andrefer to themselves as as data companiesmost companies whether it'sFinancial Services Health Careretail cpg supply chain so many of thesecompanies now identify themselves firstand foremost as a data company and so asas narendra's talking about breakingthat data unification strategy thatbecomes kind of the table stake oftransforming yourself into a datacompany and so historically thedifferent data silos whether it's inSalesforce or Google or some otherenvironment for a company those datasilos have created just exponentiallywasteful work in terms of pushing andpulling that data from one platform toanother trying to just try to put it ina place to be able to to extract insightand value out of that for a company andso a lot of what we're seeing and a lotof what we're anchored on is that dataunification strategy we're moving thoseobstacles to data access that customershave traditionally faced breaking downthose silos and making it accessiblemaking one system feel like the data isin from another system is right thereand vice versa and that's kind of what'sbeen most important about everythingwe've done with Salesforce we wementioned it really quickly but thephrase bi-directionality is really a keyphrase to a what we're building togetheras partners but B driving that value ofdata unification for our customersso that we deep dive a little bit moreon the use cases I know Narendra you hadmentioned a few kind of industryillustrations if you will in in theoverview initial overview but now thatwe've been starting to talk to morecustomers I know we're starting to Pilota lot of these Innovations curious tohear a little bit more about what areyou hearing from customers what's reallycoming up in these discussions yeah soas as we're talking to customerssurprisingly right there's a largespectrum of customers across theseverticals and and that's also in a wayrelated to the fact that now Googlecloud is becoming more and morepervasive your customers are invested interms of as a data platform which isgood news for Google of course right ifyou look at it right I have customerswho are spanning across you know cpg andRetail Telco Healthcare FinancialServices Ed Tech just to name it rightso that's a testimonial that we areinvesting this for the right reasonsbecause our customers are there and theyare asking us to solve this problem inwhich they can then get more value outof the combined Investments that theyhave made right so specifically inretail you know Google cloud has a lotof footprint with some of largeretailers they have a lot of data comingespecially on the marketing side and thead Tech side marketing side coming fromSalesforce side and and advertising datacoming from the Google side and and theyare able to then combine it with servicedata and and support data coming fromthe Salesforce side being able to thendevice you know better campaigns moretargeted campaigns and being able tothen optimize their ad spend at the atthe same time they're able to thenunderstand the conversions and thereturns that they're getting fullend-to-end story and and that is a greatvalue add in terms of when they thinkabout those use cases they love it thesame thing like I said talk about healthcare right we're talking to a few of thethe healthcare providers they have a lotof patient engagement and encounter datasitting with with Google cloud and theywant to be able to use that data to beable to connect with our customer 360and and our health and Financial Healthand Life Sciences offering through whichthen they can put them through tailoredJourneys in terms of how they can guidethem in terms of certain lifestylediseases right in terms of how they canmonitor them in terms of their healthscores and being able to then put themthrough certain care plans so those arejust two examples like it's the samething for for financial services as wellyou're talking to a lot of fintechcompanies who have a lot of theirfinancial transactional data thatthey're using and they want to be ableto connect to that to be able to powermore of you know cross-sell kind ofopportunities the promotions that theywant to be able to drive throughcustomer 360. I mean I think one of theamazing things is no matter how much wetry to control what industries and whattypes of customers and use cases we goafter the customers are really demandingfrom Salesforce and Google a variety ofthem they're kind of teaching us everyday so Narendra touched on a few but oneof the amazing things that I've seensince we launched this partnershippublicly in June and these Solutions isthat there is no limit to the use casesand verticals that this applies to andit's it's been across everything fromHealthcare to cpg to financial servicesto we have every industry represented inour process right now that we're workingwith and talking to so this is aquestion that I think the answer changesas fast as it's asked because thecustomers are demanding and they're thething I've heard more than anything elsewhen I talk to customers about this iswe've been looking this forever we'vebeen looking for this forever and sothey're just happy we're providing it atthis pointso thank everyone can definitely agreewith the fact that there is huge valuebetween data and using Ai and I thinkthe big burning question probably oneveryone's mind is how do we get startedand are there sort of key strategies ortips that you can share with startingthis journeyyeah so so as part of this process ofcourse right the first thing is that youhave to try out these features right thebase of the things right you start withthat and of course for our jointcustomers right and who are invested onthe Google side as well as who areinvested on the Salesforce side ourfirst recommendation is always startwith a specific use case in mind rightstart with the use case start with whatdata is relevant for that use casestart with that as as your first set oftest criteria through which you want tobe able to grow and see the success comethrough end to end and the efficienciesthat come along the way as a result ofdoing that right that is how we alwayswant to you know recommend you startfrom there grow from there and you willquickly learn it's very easy to be ableto build the next set of use casebecause unifying data is is so mucheasier it's in in our mind we haveturned it into a simple point and clickin a configure and an extend experiencewith which adding more data is is verysimple and easy and for you if you havebuilt your existing machine learningmodels right it's again very easy foryou to then bring them into the foldwith the same data or add more data toit and make it even better and thenbeing able to plug them back into thewhole cycle so so that's myrecommendation start with the use casestart with the data surrounding a usecase see the value see the efficiencyyou get from it end to end and keepaugmenting that over time and you'll seethat that kind of clearly grows on youin terms of the value that it deliversfor youyeah I mean start small don't boil theocean talk to your team at Salesforceand Google and and they're they're morethan happy to engage and help walk youthrough the Journey testing thesefeatures out but I agree wholeheartedlywith narender you have to start with aspecific use case understand that usecase that data and that outcome validatethat test that confirm that and then youcan go scale from thereI think the last question we're going toend on is we know AI is moving very veryfast actually it's changing pretty muchevery day and looking at this area ofmarrying Ai and data you know what areyour thoughts around the big trends thatyou're seeing any predictions that yousee maybe from now until the next 12months love to get your final thoughtson that yeah so AI is is definitely ismoving at a lightning Pace right withall the things happening especially inthe generative AI space and how sharedgbd has practically disrupted you knoweverybody in terms of thinking how theywant to think about engaging with theircustomers and or even internally withinthe organization as well so so the way Isee it is that there are two keyplumbings to it right one is the datathe data is growing but at the same timewe are giving you tools and Technologieswhich now you can deal with more dataeasily and you are able to also you knowconnect the data together into intounderstanding the customer the fullpicture of your customer right and themore data you have and the more powerfulAI models get with more data and andmore sophisticated as these algorithmswill get the kind of insights that theycan produce can become more and moreuseful and and relevant so I see thisinteresting amalgamation which is goingto have happen naturally as a course ofaction between these generative AImodels as well as these predictive AImodels with which the kind ofexperiences we can drive for the Endcustomer or for the internal employeeswill be much more natural for them tohave more trust in terms of what they'reseeing from their Ai and of course wehave to make interest into these that'sa key thing as part of our overallstrategy and that's a key thing thatthat we're doing that your first partydata your organization data with a levelof trust and explanation and thecombination of predictive Ai andgenerative AI is helping you to guideinto faster and better decision makingright that's that's the key thing that Isee is going to really really acceleratein terms of how we're thinking about theentire customer experiences over thenext year or two coming and that's aclear Focus as you must have heard interms of the announcements we're makingwith Einstein and Einstein GPT being thenext evolution of the Einstein as to howwe're thinking about evolving the entirecustomer 360.yeah I think 2023 has definitely beenthe the rise of generative AI but Ithink one of the big important trends atleast that we're starting to see isum there is going to be kind of abalancing a settling of of the balancebetween the different types of AITechnologies and applications within anenvironment we've been applying thingslike predictive AI inside of customerenvironments for a number of yearsgenerative AI is is obviously somethingthat everyone is figuring out figuringout the use cases and the applicationsof it within not only your organizationyour company but how you interact withyour customers as well so one of thethings I think that we're going to seein terms of a trend is really abalancing of of quality over quantity Ithink everyone right now is racing tofigure outum to fill the bucket with as manygenerative AI use cases that they canget the market but understanding whichof those use cases have lasting power todrive your business forward thosequality use cases that still is yet tobe determined in a lot of environmentsand and that that will be that will beworked outnarinder talked about the um the hyperpersonalization of that customerexperience I think a lot of that is bothum driven by both generative andpredictive AI but the trick is likeNarendra was saying is it's aroundgovernance and security customers aredemanding that hyper personalizationwith their vendors and the people theyinteract with whether it's a retail orcpg or some other fashion but thereality is they're also demandingsecurity and privacy along with it andso companies have to figure out not onlyhow to land those quality use cases buthow to land that in a really secure andscalable Enterprise way that you knowthat the data that your company isholding to help drive those models andtrain those models is is your company'sdata within the the four walls of yourorganization and it's not leaking outinto other places and I think that thatpoint right there is just critical forcompanies and it's quite frankly it'sone of of the things that I think thepartnership is so well balanced aroundAI I was I had the the um we hadSalesforce here at an event that GoogleCloud hosted in the area back in I thinkthe end of May around our large AI dayand then I had a chance to go representGoogle at salesforce's event in New Yorka few weeks later that Mark benioffspoke at and the messages were sosimilar around secure and Enterprisegrade AI for your organization not justflashy AI not just AI That's here that'sgot like Pizzazz but something that isactually Enterprise grade secure andcontrolled within your environment and Ithink companies are still figuring thatout and I think the balance of quantityover or quality over quantity I shouldsay figuring out how to deliver thosehyper personalized experiences forcustomers yet doing it within theframework of your governance model thatis something that I think Salesforce andGoogle Cloud are uniquely positioned todeliver for our joint customers but it'ssomething our joint customers are stillhaving to figure outall right well I want to thank ourpanelists today thank you so much forthe great talk and hopefully everyonehas a great evening thank you thank youforeign"
