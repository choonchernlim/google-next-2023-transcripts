process with text to imagemodelsright two things strike you know one iscreative right so we're talking todayabout creativityand second text to image Foundationmodels so generative AIso our goal todayis to get across those two points wehave an exciting session todayand let's get started with itso first of all let's continue theintroductionsum today I'm joined by Zach achill afellow colleague from Google and ZachHills from from London and he came allthe way from London to be with us todayand to share some exciting demosuh I'm also joined today by Vishal soodChief product officer at Thai phase whois going to talk about some excitingthings bringing typeface to creatorsworldwideand I'm also here today with art fromChief product officer at Omnicom a verywell known firm focusing on brandmarketing so you're gonna get some greatexperiences today not only from theGoogle team but also for our guestpresenters Partners customersin terms ofan introduction I like to cover five keythings we'll cover today so first of allis we start with an intro andum we're gonna talk about imagine onvertex today is Google's generative AIproductbut first of all we start with a basicFoundation about text to image modelsGeneral TBIfollowing that we'll do a deep dive ofsome of the Imagine features right asyou heard from Sundar Thomas curianother Executives we had a number oflaunches this week for Imagine we'revery happy about that and we reservesome additional launches that we'll talkabout in the session todaynext we're going to talk about some usecases and art and Vishal are going totalk about some real use cases howthey're bringing Innovation to to usersgloballythenoh in nine and you can add many ninesafter that you know of the users and theusage actually won't be users accessingimagine as Zach and I will share most ofour users will utilize imagineleveraging our partners and customersright and and and and and thereforeimagine it's Enterprise scale it has anSD SDK where developers can access it ina very simple way so we'll uh zag willtake us through thatand then uh lastly we want to share somemore resources right there's someinteresting things happening othersessions so we'll cover that as wellso let's get started with theintroductionforeign soimagine a praise in thisgenerative AI space specifically relatedto text to image generation right andmaybe if I could ask the audience youknow raise your hand if you have used atext to image model it doesn't matterwhether it's imagine or notokay well that's that's great I meanthere's a new technology I see manyhands raised but for those of you thathaven't used them I wanted to share abrief overview rightOverview at a top level text to imagegeneration uhit is an Innovative technology thatstarts with your creation yourInnovation Simple Text prompt so anyCreator can think about a text promptright like this one here a photo of acat with bright Galaxy filled eyes rightand from that text promptthese modelsput it into action and they deliver animage as you can see here rightso I wanted to accomplish those twothings today number one share a briefoverview of what we're talking abouttext to imagination and number two Iknow many of you were expecting to see acat picture and here's the cat pictureso checkboxum nowumnext I wanted to you know talk aboutum imagine rightso imagine on vertex AIlets our customers innovate create veryhigh quality images right not onlycreate images which is going from a textto an image but also starting with animage and generating a caption orunderstanding what the image says andand many more things including videoright video descriptions which weannounced this weekand the key goal for us is to do it atEnterprise scalean Enterprise scale means many thingsright it means doing this in aresponsible wayand it also means doing this in a waythat enables our customers to to growright this is a high growth area and wehave built a service that is scales youknow as much volume as you drive as youcreate the the images that you need whenyou need them and this service is hereto enable you to do that so that'simagineand and it's called Imaging on vertexbecause imagine it's a Kiko is a keycomponent of our vertex portfolio rightand vertex is our key platform thisnumber is a platform and also vertex AIincludes tools to enable data scientistsapplication developers to do many thingsincluding generation of images withimaginenow today uh I'm pleased to share thatum imagine has a number of reallyexciting features and I wanted to coverat a high level the four key features itdoes it offers today so the firstfeature is Generation I shared the cadexample earlier right generating animage text to image generation so that'sthe key code featurethe next feature is editing rightimagine also enables you to take animageto take a text prompt and to change thatimage right edit that image and we'regoing to share some really excitingexamples about editing I would say thosetwo generation and editing go kind oflikeside by side they're very commonly usedby many of our customersimagine also includes understandingright semantic understanding of imagesthere's a captioning capability whichenables you to submit an image andimagine will deliver a caption for theimage it will describe the imagegenerates the descriptionand lastly but not least imagine has asophisticatedvisual query answering capabilityand the model here is that you you as adeveloper you submit an image you submita question and the model generates ananswer based on the questionso you could submit a an image ofof my shirt right and you could ask aquestion is this a long sleeve shirt andit will tell you yes it's a long sleeveshirt you could ask the color of theshirt it will answer all these questionsand it all it does all of this withoutthe need for any training is agenerative AI modelso with that Foundation I'm gonna nowdeep dive into some of the features ofImagine available todayfirst one is code features right interms of core features we have the thekey generation feature does power but avery high quality model right togenerate imageswe do this in a responsible way so everytime you have generative AI uh we we atGoogle we believe is really critical forgenerative AI to supportthe creation of the content in aresponsible way so we have a number ofapproaches user configurable safetyfilters to enable you to do thata key priority for for models is uhspeed so imagine it's a model that youget the outcomes in seconds right andand that's really critical for ourEnterprise customersand then we also have a core capabilitywhich is what we call upscaling superresolution where after you generate theimage you can ask imagine to increasethe resolution to 2000 by 2000 pixels orfour thousand by four thousand pixelsrightnext capabilities editing rightum editing again it starts with an imagethat you provide and you edit it rightyou can change the scenery for exampleand we're pleased today to introducesome new feature we see a common usecase is to edit images of products rightfor e-commerce Etc and there's a newfeature we'll talk about a bit latercalled product image editingthen we have a common feature which isStyles right so sometimes in yourcompany your marketing team they mayhave a particular style you know a setof colors that they want to Leverage ispart of the brand or you know you may bedesigning an ad for a new restaurant wewere having dinner a few of us yesterdayand we were saying you know if you startup a restaurant you want that thatBanner ad for your restaurant to reflectthe look and feel of your restaurant sothis is the new capability that enablesyou to do thatwe also haveum a feature related to toning so againfor those in the room you may have heardGoogle research talk aboutum dream Booth rightum and a Google research paper thatenabled these models to learn specificobjects we call them subjects so you cannot only use imagine as is but you cantrain imagine with subjects that arerelevant to your businessso we're pleased today to introduce anew feature we call it instant tuning sowe're introducing that in this sessiontoday and we're very happy about thatwe're gonna have a brief demo of ourZoneand we also have a image understandingas I mentioned earlier with captioningand visual query answeringand then finally this week last but notleast we introduce digital watermarkingand verification sooner introduce thecapabilityand we're very excited about this is acapability that will have many uses andwill do a demo for you in a few minutesso with thatum I'd like now todeep dive into some of these featuresand also share some demos so imagegenerationagain this is really critical right andthe goal here is to make the creativeprocess faster right as the title of thesession says so you may be an architectright and in the past you have uhimagine a new building a new residenceright and to go from your imagination asan architect to actually getting animage of what you want to build it willtake it will take time right now withthese capabilities you can create thisvery fast you can create images as yousee here that reflect the goal you haveor you could be a fashion designer rightdesigning the next fashionable casualshoes rightit's a technology that applies to manydifferent use casesso next what I like to do is uh inviteZach Akil who is going to share a briefdemo of generation capabilities Iimagineheyso hello everyone my name is Zach and mylaptop I need to log into it first uhwho wants to see live demos ofgenerative AIexcellent I do too and Iuh if we switch to the demo now we willsee the UI in vertex AI of what theImagine looks like so all the featuresthat we are talking about today you canactually access and test we like tothink of it as testing and prototypingthrough the UI so this is an excellentway that without you having to write anycode if you just want to test thecapabilities of it you can go directlyinto the vertex AI console and playaround with itnowI like to play sportspart of that might be increasing myheart rate that might also be why I likelive demos but I think I can push thingsa bit further and get some audiencesuggestions for the things I'm going togenerateso I visited San Francisco now and I'mcurious to know about some foods thatpeople like to eat here so if anybodygot any suggestions for foods that SanFrancisco is known forshout them outclam chowder any othersburritos what elseI'm writing this downwhatsourdough is that San Francisco Ithought I thought London tomorrow okaygonna go gonna go for clam chowder Ilike clam chowder okay so what I'm gonnado I'm gonna generatea bowl or let's see clam chowder clamchowder in a woodenBowlit's always fancier when it's in awooden Bowlso I'm gonna make sure I'm spellingcorrectly let's generate a lot ofexamplesand I want to notehow fast it's gonna be that is a gambleto say right as I hit enter so we'regenerating look at that so we've alreadygot our clam chowder generated but let'ssay I'm generating this for a restaurantthat I'mpotentially opening and I want to makethe scene a bit nicer let's add stuffit's usually a good practice to be asspecific and you can be as elaboratewith your prompts as possible and Ialways like to put stuff in the in thebackground so I'm going to put in with ablurryBridgein the backgroundokayI like making stuff blurry it makes itlook really nice and fancy so againrewriting the prompts look at this oh sonow I've got my images that I might usefor my menu and soin this we've seen how fast it is todevelop uh how you can kind of quicklyiterate your ideas and come up with NewImage designs and also a thing to noteis and again I'm doing this in the UIbut everything we're showing there is anSDK and an API for this so if you wantthis functionality built into yoursystems and apps you can do exactly thatwith that I will hand it back to Nelsonto talk about the rest of the featuresthank you Zach super excitingumthank youso that's image generationum another key feature as I mentionedearlier is related to product imageediting right we have many companies youknow have products right and productsusually get shown in websites e-commercewebsites right that they're key toattract your customers to let themexperience your product an offense whatyou have is you start off with an emailan image of a product like you see hereis an image but many times you just wanttoput the product in a different settingright you want to change the product ina new setting and that requires a coupleof really key capabilities number oneis scene generation as you can see hereright you generate a scene around theproduct but the other key capabilitywith these models is you want to makesure that the product keeps theappearance right and in this case theproduct has text has visuals so thoseare two key factors and we're pleasedthatour Google shopping team announced thiscapability earlier this year at Google IO many Merchants that work with Googleshopping really like this capability andworkplace that through thiscollaboration between Google cloud andGoogle shopping we can bring the samefeatures to imagine and is available APISDK is available today and now I'm goingto turn it over to Zach for a briefshowcase go ahead Zach if we couldswitch back to the demo okay we'reswitching back to demos it's going to bea demo Rich session okay so we're backin the UI before we were over here inthe generate section we moved over hereinto the edit section and what we'regoing to do is we're going to come overhere and enable product style imageediting that's going to be this featureand you can enable it in the UI butagain everything here is API and SDKavailable as well so you can do all thesame stuff with codeand then we need to come up with theproducts we want to generate photos forbecause we can generate them if we'vegot a photo of a unique item and oneunique item that I think is going to becool to test is something unique to thisevent so we've actually got has anyonegot the fancy uh Cloud next bottle withthe cool like rubber bit hold it up sopeople can see it people in the backpeople in the middle so people can seethis is the product this is the productso I have taken yeah hold it up lookaround you can see what it looks like soI've got a photoand let's say we want to create some newversions of this so here it is so I gota photo I took a photo and thenwhat I can do we've got the productstyle enabled I can enter in prompt andif everyone looks directly upI have just typed this in right now andwhat I'm doing is I'm I wrote a promptand a hot tip is I'm going to set thisoffand a thing to note a best practice whenwriting prompts especially for doingthings regarding like generating newbackgrounds for products or images oranything else is rather than just writethe prompt because we know the prompt isgoing to edit the generate thebackground rather than just Definehere's what the background should looklike it's a good tip to also referencethe subject in the prompt so I'm notjust saying I want the background tolook like this I'm saying a water bottleon a desk with pencils pens and paperalso on the desk with sunlight comingthrough the window in the background soI've referenced the subject in my promptI think it's a really key feature andthis is it we've now got our fancyproduct images generatedand you can see it's kind of kept theperspective of the background it'sgenerated relative to the object andyeah I think it's gonna be reallypowerful for people who want to quicklygenerate new product photos with anyproducts they havethat's the demo thank you very much backto Nelson thank you greatexcellentumso Styles right styles are the key rightso we we know that Styles weaccomplished two things one is make itreally simple to generate images thatreflect a particular style and we haveseven stars that are predefined but inaddition to thatright enablingdevelopers users creators to take a fewimagesand launch a customer style so let's seethe stars in action with Zach again backto the demoback to the demo uh slides please or onthe screen so we're going to jump backinto the generate section where we'vegot our clam chowder still sitting thereand let's say Okay I want to open arestaurant in San Francisco so it's gotto be hip and happening so we've gotsome styles that are pre-built into itso it can regenerate this using our popart styleand it's same prompt again it's allshowing how quickly you can iteratestuff and now we've got some more coolquirky versions of the same image butwith our predefined style that's alreadybuilt in to imagineso that is an example of how you can usepredefined Styles butlet's say you've got your own styleyou've got something from your owncompany that you want to replicate andan example of this that I think isreally cool is actually it's good toknow is there anybody in the crowd who'sweb developers done anything with frontends build DUIs anything like this okayso I've done that as well and one of thecommon challenges of that is havingconsistent iconsso you might find like a cool icon packbut it's okay we've got a couple of coolicons here but we're missing like anicon for I know a new section of the UIlike oh I've got to find a designer toredo thatwhat if you could say start with I thinkI've got here's some icons here so we'vegot these icons notice that there's onlyseven of them so we've got seven iconsand we've fed these into imagine togenerate a custom style what would youcall it model yeah custom style customstyle yeah isometric we call them isometwe call these isometrics so we we fedthese into imagine it's learned thisstyleso then we can come back into ourimagine and generate we'll generate clamchatter but I'll generate a freighttruckand then over here we can say use ourcustom style isometric select it'll sayreference this in the promptor I can just copy it inisometric Styleso beforewe didn't have an icon for our websiteand now we have these cool icons Iactually think it's probably a coolthing to show without this isometricstyle defined what the trucks look likeso here's the icons that we've gotgenerated and here is what wouldnormally come out of imagine if you saya freight truck so it goes to show thepower of using this custom style featureespecially if you've got the requirementto have you know consistent marketingmaterial things like that in yourcompany so it's really powerful featureespecially for developers if you want togenerate icons I think but yeahback to Nelson thank youexcellent excellent well now it is ourpleasure to introduce Vishal suit chipproduct officer at I phase welcomeMichelle[Applause]so hi everyone I'm Vishal uh so sorryyeah I do need to collect slides uh soso Vishal I have lead product attypeface and we are pretty excited andkind of we have a lot of gratitudetowards the Imagine team we use theirmodels we also use the text model fromvertex Ai and before I talk much abouttypeface let me just kind of play avideo just give you a sneak peek of thedemo uh so let's just roll it and thenwe can talk more about typefaceexcels at creating visually strikingimages it falls short in capturing aBrand's unique voice and visual identitytypefaces AI is specifically to bedesigned to help Brands create contentthat not only looks great but feels likeit truly belongs to them and our AI isdedicated solely to your brand so yourIP always remains private and secureso how does it work we absorb everythingabout your brand from image samples tomessaging to Brand guidelines then wetrain custom AI this is unique as yourbrand itself now any employee can turntheir creative ideas into compellingimages and copy in just a second allwhile staying on brand and personalizedto your audience profiles gone are thedays when on-brand content creation waslimited to a select few we get it youneed more than just one-off contentpieces that's why typeface has a widerange of templates create 10 times morepersonalized content across all yourchannels campaigns and audience segmentseverything from digital ads to SEOoptimized blog posts to localized webpages to more this is typeface the onlyAI designed for Enterprises so yourbrand can truly tell your story your way[Music]oh thank you for that so let me kind ofquickly brief what you just saw so yousaw an Enterprise SAS application thatcan learn your products it can learnyour voice and it can now create outputswhich are multimodal in nature so aGoogle responsive display ad has bothimages and text in it and now we can dothat all with one shot and I wouldencourage you to visit our booth ifthat's kind of interesting to you and wehave much more detailed demos there butbefore I go deeper on the typeface stackand how we built it on top of imagineand other models let me actually talkabout how companies are trying toleverage generative Ai and what problemsare they struggling with right so thereare broadly four kinds of problems wehear from all the customers we talk tothe first problem is All About the Bestin Class models now I don't know howmany of you are kind of very active inthis space every single morning I wakeup there are four new Twitter demos fivenew models and the models I knew havealready been updated so it's just crazyhow fast the space is moving like westarted types about a year ago and atthat point of time there was noin this kind of scale there was nocharge GPT nothing and just a year laterwe're phenomenally kind of improved thequality of the output and imagine teamand the Bison team is going to movereally really fast but then you want apartner in this journey who can stay ontop of all these Innovations like wehave a very close partnership with uhNelson here and team and we move in therelease something that few days later wehave it in production so that's the kindof scale people want right so that's thefirst part of it the second part is deeppersonalization so companies you have alot of content already it's not like youdon't have content today but how can weuse that content to learn from it andthen create unique assets in your brandin your voice in your products in it andhow do we do it at scale you don't haveto do it one by one in the UI how do wedo it in a batch mode in a workflowsetting right so that's the kind ofproblem you need to solve which alsoplays into the last one but I'll getback to that the third is IP ownershipso everything typeface does isEnterprise grade so as you share yourcontent with us we create a prettyunique layer called typeface graph I'llcover that in a second but how do weprotect your assets from helping improvejust generic public AI but we actuallyjust keep that for your company andcreate assets which are fairly uniquebut at the same time all your contentyour voice and your assets are alwayssecure the last thing is integratedworkflows so I I don't know how many ofyou are in the marketing space but Idon't know how many martech tools existthere and people have already pickedtheir favorite ones and marketers areactually already in their tools whatthey don't want to do is learn yetanother tool so how do we integrategenerative AI into your existingworkflows and help you create contentwherever you already are so that's avery big piece of puzzle that you alsoneed to solve when you look at thisso these four problems are preciselywhat we are solving at typeface and letme quickly cover how we are doing it sovery early on in the Taipei Journey wemade a very conscious decision that weare not going to invest and build ourown foundational models we're not goingto build an llm we're not going to buildan image model and we're going to relyon the Best in Class models that existout there and that's why we partner withGoogle and and that partnership is kindof gone very well for us and are happyto talk more about it but we actuallybuilt on top of Google's vertex AImodels which we have talked aboutearlier as well and what typeface doesis is the three layers on top of that Ithought this was a technical audience sothis is my attempt at an architectureslide so if you look at the first layerthere it's called the graph so thesimplest way to think about it is youbring your existing content in intotypeface and it doesn't have to be acopy you can point us to your existingdigital Asset Management Systems you canpoint us to your existing CMS systems oryou can point us to a Google drive withall your content on it we can learn fromthat and we create a private contentgraph for you within typeface so I sayprivate because this is is not going tohelp your competition it's not going tohelp generic AI get better it's going tobe the special AI for for your companyand that's the graph layer then what wedo is we take this knowledge that wehave from your company we marry it withthe foundational models like imagine youjust saw some pretty cool demos and wenow create personalized content for youwhich is our blend layer so the blendlayer actually does that so when youwere seeing in the UI the Roja perfumeexample that was blend layer in actionand then finally as business users youdon't really want to learn I know theprompting is great and and Zach is amaster of that art but but not everybodyis right so how do you help peopleespecially people who don't do this fora living don't have to worry aboutprompts they can just fill simple formsand how can we automatically create somecompelling content for them so how doyou stay in the flow of your work andstill create compelling content which isflow of your work could be I actuallywant a Google ad I don't necessarilywant to know how to go about creating animage then a text I just want to do itone shot right and the second thing is Iwant it within the app I am already inwhere I'm planning my paid mediacampaigns so that's the flow layer forus and on top of that exist various usecases like marketing HR sales andproductsso that's a little bit about thetechnical stack behind type is and letme just talk about this a little bitso uh is anybody here from marketing orWorks in marketing space at all okay soso let me tell you a little bit aboutmarketing sowhat happens is you a lot of marketerswe talk to they usually have some formof a Content it could be a YouTube videoit could be some existing product imagesbut then the name of the game ispersonalization like how do I reach tovarious channels so if I go to InstagramI talk in a certain voice and my I havea certain style to my images if I go onmy website I have a slightly differentstyle uh to my images so that's kind ofone form of personalization which is achannel based personalization the secondform of personalization is within thatchannel how do I optimize for everysingle audience or the or a set ofaudiences that come to my site so that'sthe second form of what uhpersonalization then finally there'sanother personalization which is all ofthis I want to keep a consistent brandvoice and brand kit and all that kind ofstuff that I already have which couldmean like if you look at Google's wholebranding in the show there are fourpredominant colors you will see and howdo you kind of incorporate all of thesepersonalizations and help you createcontent skill and that's kind of whattype is does and we do it with the helpof our partners at Google also thank youokayI'll give it back to Nelson thank you[Applause]to see and we now wanted to highlighttwo additional features that we'rereally excited aboutum the next one is toning rightum raise your hand if you have heardabout tuning tuning for objects dreambooths dream Booth Google research paperright exactly right so that's a verycommon capability is supported andimagine we have two features to enabletuning one is what we call the standardtuning based on dream proof Googleresearch but we're pleased to launch anadditional featurecalled instant tuning now instant tuningis a brand new capability it'ssignificantly shortens the time that youneed to train the model right instanttuning really works well with commonobjects but if you have an object thatis more unique to your business youcould actually leverage the standardtuning based on dream boss but instanttuning we're very excited about and thenas Zach is going to share a brief demoof tuning instant tuning in particularokay so if we canswitch back no my prompts are visiblenowso if we switch back to the demo so hereis an example in fact I'll show weshould have an image somewhere uh mightbe oh there it is so this is an actualimage we took of a brown bag and what wecan do is we've uploaded how many imagesdid we upload to a few shots like fourto six images not that much four to siximages of this specific product yep andwhat we can do is then start generatingimages with that product so we can comeinto the generation we can specify not astyle but a custom subjectand we have a few here but we have thehandbag so we'll select that and it willsay okay if you want to start using thiscustom subject simply reference handbagin your prompt so we'll do that and I'mgoing to type really fast there we goand this is a handbag on a white carpetlet's generate a couple of these solet's say we're generating brand newproduct photos so we would maybe specifyif we've got for building a new productwe could upload and find China modelsspecifically for our company we've gotreally quick access to generate imagesof that product and you'll see it'sgenerating the product images but youcan see there's like slight variationsin the angle of the product I meanthere's like creases where there weren'tcreases so it's very intelligentunderstanding of actually even theproperties of the product and how itcompares to like maybe how bags can movein the natural world but yeah that's thethat's how we do fine tuning and we'llhand it back to Nelson instant tune inthank you thank youso we have one more demoum and this demo is about digitalwatermarking right but let me introducethe concept firstum there are two important questionsright that are that are our customersask when images are generated by AIright and and really the first questionis how do you uh protect your contentright as Michelle was describing earlierhow do you ensure that this image thatyou generated with your creativity isprotected question number one andquestion number two is what if somebodyclaims that your company generated animage but that image actually wasn'tyours or maybe you generated the imageand somebody edited the image and theyclaim that is your image rightthat's where digital watermarking comesin rightandthis new capability we launched inpartnership with Google did mind isbased on the Google that mine synth IDtechnology and it starts with an imageyou Watermark that image right you thewatermarking service and then you get animage now if you see those two images tothe eye there look exactly the same butthey're different the pixels in thewatermark image include a watermarkrightthat that is a key thing and what thatdoes is it makes it very robust it makesit very difficult to Tamper that imagewith that you know with that uh withthat really editing the image withoutknowing that that image was watermarkedto begin with and then we also provide averification service rightwhere you can send an image and thisverification service will tell youwhether the image is Watermark notWatermark or whether the image waswatermarked but changed and zag willshare a brief demookay if we switch back to the demo whatI'm showing is our fancy chowderpictures and if we want to inject ourdigital Watermark into these picturesall we have to do is generate them withthis setting add digital Watermarkenabled so I will enable that and then Iwill hit generate and this will go offthis will generate those images againand inject that invisible Watermarkvisually into the image so what we havenow is we have these images and theyhave a watermark that is imperceivableto humans so I will download one oftheselet's exportso that's now we get the option toupscale that's where that's done butI'll just download it and we have ourverify service so we come over here wecan upload our image this is the imagethat we just downloadedwe see what am I protected cool butlet's upload an image that doesn't havea watermark what would that happen solet's say I don't know this one this isa screenshot of the bag that's assumeddoesn't have a watermarkbut there is a question which Iinitially had as a developer I'm like Iwant to break this so what happensclassic thing an image that has awatermarkwhat happensanybody know what I'm going to test outshout it outscreenshot it that's it I'm gonna I'mgonna hack this let's screenshot it noteven screenshot it perfectlycapturethat saved come over verify uploaddownload this is the screenshot you cansee the nameWatermark detected all right thewatermark is not part of the metadata ofthe image it's actually the visual dataof the image it's a very powerful robustservice with that hand it back to Nestawesome thank you Zach thank youexcellent[Applause]well I'm now really excited to Welcometo the stage ashram from Omnicom Chiefproduct officer Romney come welcomecharmall right thanks Nelson thanks I thinkwe're almost out of time so I'm going totry to move very very quicklyumperfect uh thrilled to be here excitedto talk about what we're doing withgenerative AI Omnicomum I know there's a technical audienceI'm going to focus a little bit moreinitially on the the business aspecttalk about how we've deployed technologyat Omnicom uh and how that influences tosome degree how we Implement theseTechnologies if you don't know who whatOmnicom is we're one of the world'slargest marketing Communications firmswe're a holding company of largeagencies across all aspects of marketinguh Creative MediaEtc and and we view generative AI asfundamental uh to our business goingforwardum in terms of uh data AI technology wehave been hyper focused on deployingthese capabilities and uh in in theservice of outcomes for our clients andwe do that through a platform that wecall Omni which is really our operatingsystem it's how we bring technology tothe hands of our of our practitionersand into the to the heart of everythingthat we douh and Omni is five years old it'sGlobal it's scaled and from inception AIhas been at the heart of what we do butclearly the the Advent of generative AIhas caused us to really rethink or orprioritize the injection of AI into allaspects of the marketing workflowum so across automation predictivemodels uh personalization theoptimization of campaigns But ultimatelyin the actual creation of content whichis where we partnered with Google andimagine and we'll talk about that in asecond and ultimately we don't justthink that this is something that'sgoing to transform the work we do forour clients we think this technologytransforms ultimately our entireorganization we've already deployed anumber of different AI based utilitieswithin Omni as a platformat the heart of this just before we getinto the the image generation piece wefeel it for an organization of our sizeif you think about the clients that wework with large Global Brands aresponsible AI approach uh the vettingof the the models from ethics and legalperspective is critical that's actuallyone of the key reasons that we actuallyhave partnered with Google on imagine uhand and we we're really excited to workwith with them on on that portion of thecapabilityand ultimately none of this matters ifwe actually don't use these Technologiesto make an impact on our clientsbusinessso content generation there arethousands of top level creativeprofessionals at Omnicom we have uh youknow as an industry a conference in thesouth of France every year where wecelebrate path breaking creative work soyou can imagine that um talking aboutgenerating content with artificialintelligence is a really really big dealfor us and initially where we see thekey opportunity given the types ofclients we work with the type of work wedo is really in pre-productionInspiration the ability to iteratethrough content through through Conceptsand and versions and so forth reallyreally efficiently really really quicklyand expand the scope of what we're doingand deliver better work for our clientsand that's ultimately where we'vepartnered with with imagine and we'lltalk about how that worksum I'm not a creative I'm sort of amartech nerd which is much less cool butultimatelyum I worked with our creative Communityto kind of think about how we bringtogether the rich data that lives in ourOmni platform uh with creative insightsand prompts feed that into imagine andthen deliver a Content experience andI'll get into just a little bit of senseof how we're doing that and then we'lldo a super quick demo uh video demo ofhow it comes to life for for in our inour platform so what we're doing iswe're taking the audience Persona fromOmni think of that as a customersegmentation a profile which comes witha huge set of Rich data assets and we'rerunning that through an llm andcompressing it into uh into a verbaldescription and prompt and then marryingthat with creative Direction CreativeConcepts some of the stuff that uh thatyou you just saw in some of the demosand then creating a new prompt which wecall a dprompt to diffusion prompt whichis specifically Divine for or or createdfor Imagine to the point earlier thatnot all of our end users are likeexperts in prompt engineering and we'refeeding that in and generating theimageryand I'll show you uh how it worksso I'm actually going to start in Omnium and uh this is this is the platformyou can see that we have variouscapabilities different tools uh and uhdifferent outputs from those tools andI'm going to go into ultimately ouraudience Explorer capability and showyou an audience that that I created forfor the conference which is a a sort ofa yoga Enthusiast audienceum so I bring up the yogi enthusiastsyou can see there's a bunch ofdemographic data about that audience thereason I want to show this because Iwant to show kind of the richness of thedata file that we ultimately feed intothe model that creates The Prompt forimage creation so various differenttypes of uh data attributesAdvanced audience data media consumptiondata all of that all those attributesabout our users is partum of of what makes up that audienceprofile and then the criteria to buildthat that audience uh is some Advancedaudience profilesum you know focusing on Fitness Yoga Etcokay now I'm actually going to generatethrough the llm the the verbaldescription of that audienceuh which describes the audience and thenI'm going to switch to our imagerenovation framework which is going tocall Imagine and I'm going to take thatmarry it with some key stylistic guidesin this case a relaxing Fine Artillustrative style a relaxing mood andI'm sorry so that's a custom style andthen generate a set of of images andagain we've seen a bunch of these demostoday now so you have a sense of how theproduct works enabling certain imageediting capabilities all of which uh siton top of of aspects of of imagine andthenum uh then I can actually take thoseaudiences those audiences those thoseimages and start to curate them into acollectionum and then sort of Name That collectionand Define it as an object uh in umand so this is where uh you know we'd bestarting to create that mood board of uhof of Creative Concepts that thosecreatives can then use to to drive theirwork forward and then you know ifultimately once I've created that thatcollection uh if I have a sense of thatI want to create additional Styles I canI can bring that up change thatillustrative style to a photorealisticstyle maybe change camera angles againuh referencing back the demos that wesaw earlier and I can bring those imagesup add those to the collection andultimately Define the sort of theparameters of that of that creativeideation that's going to drive thatprocess forward and that becomesum the uh the an object uh in Omni thatwe can people can collaborate on you cansee it on over there alongside audiencesand other aspects so I hope we give youa sense of how we're approaching uh thethe use of generative AI I think keypoint is that we do envisage over timepotentially the utilization of thiscapability and production production adsat this stage it's really about thatpre-production inspiration and I'll passit back to Nelson arapa[Applause]excellent that was great to seeum great to see all the Innovation heretodayI we as we discussed right API we saw anumber of demos on the UI but API SDKthat's really important to provide adeveloper experience and I like to turnit over to Zach who is going to talkabout that experience for developers goahead Zach absolutely uh the basicallythe thing to know is that there is anSDK everything we've shown uh throughthe UI the visible invisible Watermarkverification generation editing tuningeverything is accessible through apython SDK at the moment with morelanguages to come later but also a fullrest API so if you can make rest callsfrom your applications or services orpipelines you can use imagine in yourpipelines right now I'm going to ask toswitch to the demo laptop it's notreally a demo but more just to show thatthere is code there are code Labsavailable on the Google Cloud generativeAI uh repository in GitHub that show youhow you can run imagine in notebooksright now and in fact we'll switch backto the slides to show some of theresources where you can learn more aboutimagine and get started with imaginecode yeah fantastic so so in basicallyhave additional sessions there's somesessions taking place tomorrow othersessions already took place but youconsider recording we also haveresources there's a lot of documentationabout imaginethere is also the SDK information andalso uh there is a at the export there'san exciting couple of exhibits one ongenerative Ai and there's an exhibitthat's really interesting where you canget a souvenir a postcard rightgenerated by llms by palm and imagine sowe look forward to seeing you thereand and also last but not least wereally appreciate your feedback we hopethat this session was useful and if youcould leverage the app and share yourfeedback we appreciate it and for thoseof you that are here enjoy the rest ofcloud next and those of you watchingremotely have a great day or yourevening andthank you everybody appreciate it okayforeign"
