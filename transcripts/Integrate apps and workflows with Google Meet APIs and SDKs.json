people come onstage our engineering lead Patrick andalso one of our awesome Partners HubSpotwho sent one of their product leads tocome here PatriceConnell all right let me give you alittle bit of a lay of the land of whatwe're going to cover today so first I'llgive you an overview of workspace andmeet and how platform fits into ourvision for our users and developers I'llgo over our apis and how to bring meatinto your app and all the things you cando on that front and also give you aglimpse of something new that we havecooking up then you're going to hearfrom Patrice from HubSpot she's going totalk a little bit about thedecision-making process for integratingwith meat the experiences that they aresuper excited to unlock for theircustomers and just overall what it'sbeen like to build with our apis andthen I'll come back on stage talk aboutadd-ons talk about the other directionwhich is to bring your app into meetPatrick our in lead will come up andtell you how to build one of thoseadd-ons and then last but definitely notleast we're going to close with a livedemoof what add-ons looks like today cool solet's dive in so first let's talk aboutthe workspace opportunity why even buildwith workspace at all well ourdevelopers who build on our platformtoday can tell you that they're able toreach 3 billion users and 10 millionpaid businesses which translates to over5 billion app installs and add-oninstalls from our Marketplace which isprettyamazing our platform sees workspace atthe center of people's work we leverageour Google Cloud's tools and servicesbuild on our customers data andprocesses by bringing in third-partyapps to amplify workspace and make iteven morehelpful we succeed in this by looking atthree different pillars so the first isto build an extensible platform that's aset of apis power ful thoughtful andeasy to use we build out and feed into ahealthy app ecosystem that superchargesworkspace all in the spirit of our thirdpillar which is to create seamlessworkflows so that our users can be inthat optimized most productive State ofMind with totalease all right so let's zoom into meetspecifically we're excited to be one ofthe latest products to join workspaceplatform and we're excited to letdevelopers bring the power of videoconferencing to their product so ourproduct our platform is built in twodirections one is to bring meet to yourapp offering video conferencing rightfrom your UI and the other is to bringyour app into meet and to supercharge ameeting experience that way all right solet's start with the right side of theslide and talk about bringing meat toyour app so first I'll talk about ourtwo apis we have a rest API and we havean events API and one really complementsthe other and they are the foundation ofour platform so our API lets you dobasic operations around meeting creationand information retrieving and ourevents API lets you subscribe tomeetings or users at and lets you getnotified when things happen that youcare about the moment they happen allright so let's dive a little deeper intoeach one of those our rest API lets youdo some of the things that our userswould do in the UI behind the scenes soyou can do things like create a meetingyou can programmatically configuremeeting settings and controls you canretrieve meeting information likeparticipation info or how long themeeting's been going on and you canfetch meeting artifacts liketranscription and recording some of themadditional features we're building nowand into2024 is around preconfiguring meetinghosthost controls setting open and Anonymousaccess levels for meetingspreconfiguring when the meetingrecording would start and alsopreconfiguring breakout rooms so staytuned forthose so our events API lets you knowabout changes the moment they'rehappening in meetings so that you can goahead and turn around and do somethingin your UI or use another one of ourplatform pieces that's relevant aboutthe change that you just got notifiedabout so potential subscriptions hereare you want to know when meetings arecreated when meetings have started whenparticipants are coming and going andalso when a mating artifact is ready foryou tofetch so let's bring this to Life bylooking at a couple of use cases thathave been most popular with our partnersso far all right so obviously at itsmost basic you're able to offer meat asan entry point right from your own UIthis gives your users a way to connectover video live to deepen theirengagement over your content right fromyour app using the event API you can letthese users know who else is in themeeting and how long the meeting hasbeen going on you can change some of theUI components based on this informationyou can post artifacts in the UI so thatusers can review the meeting notesafterwards catch up on action items andjust digest the information after themeeting has ended and you can combinethese same artifacts with your own vastamounts of data to provide reallypowerful insights that are unique to theintegration withmeat so next and last in this categoryof bringing meat to your app is a newSDK that we're building that's currentlyin Early Access and that's our embed SDKso this SDK lets you embed meat rightinto your app as an iframe and thismeans the user isn't only able to starta meeting from your app they're alsoable to participate in that meetingwithout leaving your UI this means youcan create a much more rich and Nativeexperience for your user from end tofrom the beginning to the end of thejourney and let's you retain contextover the user so that you can create amore personalized experience forthem so you see there's tons of usecases that this area can already solveof bringing me to your app and this isis just thebeginning we are already working with aset of Partners who have integrated withme and there's a sample of them here andthese are truly our partners in crimethey test Out Concepts build with earlyversions of our Solutions provide ussuper valuable feedback so that theplatform pieces are ready to go when wewant to open up to broaderaccess and they really shape the futureand the versions of ourplatform so I know as a developer it'susually most exciting and Powerful tohear from other developers who arebuilding with these solutions to hearabout best practices and learnings andto learn about a real integrationexperience so we're so excited today tohave one of our amazing Partners here totell you just this and let's welcomehops spots lead product manager PusaConnell to the stage and she's going totell you about how a HubSpot integratedwith meat and what it's dothank you Ma hi everyone I'm delightedto be here at hubs at Google meet uh totell you about HubSpot and Google meetsintegration and the partnership that wehave together building on the new Googlemeet API my name is Patrice oconnell I'ma senior product manager at HubSpotworking on strategicIntegrations HubSpot was established in2006 and our objective as anorganization is to help our customers togrow better we want to ensure that ourcustomers are better able to connectwith yourcustomers and so our our goal is toenable teams to work together and tocustomize HubSpot to meet your businessneeds including Integrations like ourGoogle meet integration so in 2022 welaunched our core Google meetintegration on the calendar API andtoday this integration is used by over30,000customers hob SWAT brings great customerconnection and and Google meet brings agreat collaboration platform andtogether this is a powerfulcombination over the last year we'worked together with the Google meetTeam to build a new bespoke API andenable unique Solutions within ourintegration a key initiative at HubSpotis conversation intelligence whichallows you to bring the voice of thecustomer into the HubSpot platform andwe establish Google meet as the perfectintegration partner for us collaboratingwith the Google meet team we we builtthe new Google meet API which enablesHubSpot conversation intelligence withinour Google meet integration and thisallows us to automatically syncrecordings and transcripts from yourGoogle meet meetings intoHubSpot our customers that are alreadyusing hopspot conversation intelligenceare seeing the impact and the benefitfor their business with Rich customerinsights enabling sales coaching fastersales processes and higher rates ofleads and Deals onethis new API allows HubSpot to extendconversation intelligence to our Googlemeet integration and allows Google toextend the new API to other partnerswith similar usecases through our partnership ourengineering and design teams have workedvery closely together to make thishappen and today hubspot's developmentteam is now building on the new API andwe're planning to launch HubSpotconversation intelligence with ourGoogle meet integration by the end ofthis yearlet me give you a sneak peek at whatthis lookslike the Google meet integration can beinstalled from hubspot's Marketplacelisting to your HubSpotaccount from here you'll be taken to theintegration settings page where we'veadded a number ofcontrols from global settings for theadmin of the account to the my settingstab for the users of theaccount on the global settings tab theadmin has the ability to turn onrecording and transcript sync for allour select group of users of thisaccount the admin can also apply adomain exclusion so that internalmeetings don't get ingested as part ofthisintegration now that those settings arein place the user can go to the mysettings tab and they also have theability to switch on or off recordingand transcripts L for their ownaccount now that these settings are inplace you'll see all of your meetingssyncing from the Google meet integrationto the call object index page here inHubSpot and so by clicking into one ofthesemeetings here you'll find your recordingand transcript available and we've alsoadded a number of features here to helpyou better utilize thisdata from the speaker track that allowsyou to see participant engagement duringthemeeting to the transcript search barthat allows you to search for key topicsthat were discussed during themeeting you'll see that the recordingwill also skip to that point in theconversation where you can watch backabout thattopic notes and track terms allow you tomanage and customize the data from thismeeting to share more easily withinHubSpot and the associations tab allowsyou to associate this record with anyother areas of HubSpot from contactscompanies deals and so on by clickinginto an Associated contact record forexample you can see that the recordingand transcript also becomes availabledirectly on that contact record whichallows you to keep this information inthe relevant areas of HubSpot that areuseful foryou so as you can see this brings a lotof Rich data from the combination of theGoogle meet API and hubspot'sconversation intelligence allowing youto empower your teams to make meaningfulconnections that drive results for yourbusiness looking to the Future hubspot'scontinuing to invest in conversationintelligence with intelligent meetingsummaries coaching playlists andenhanced insights andactions with our Google meet integrationwe're continuing to partner with theGoogle meet Team to bring new use casesto this integration including webinarand event management AI add-ons and moreso through our continued partnershipwe're continuing to bring a connectedcustomer experience to ourusers it's been a great pleasure to behere talking with you today and thankyou very much back to you[Applause]m all right that was so awesome thanksso muchPatrice so I hope you all have yourcreative juices flowing and thinking ofall kinds of ways to bring me to yourapp and I can't wait to see what you'regoing to doum next we're going to talk about theother direction which is to bring yourapp into meet you can bring a delightfuland super powerful experience inside themeeting itself with your app at thecenter so for this you're going to useour meet add-ons SDK and this SDK allowsyou to iframe your app into the meet UIit lets meeting participants interactdirectly with your content inside themeat canvas we have two Frameworks foryou to choose from with this SDK thefirst one is the focus framework whereyour app is the focal point of themeeting and the next one is calledaugment where the meeting and theconversation continue to stay the focusand your app augments the conversationso let's take a closer look at each ofone of those in the focus framework yourapp takes the largest amount of realestate in Meet what we call Main stageor center stage and it's really bestused when your app tends to be the focalpoint of discussion so examples on thisfront are a brainstorming sessionplanning designing something togethercharting something out um and the setupstage is in the side so things likelogin permissions content selection andthen once we're ready for the activitythe app moves into the main stage of theframe in the augment framework you yourapp stays in the sidebar the entire timeand the meeting is the focus for thediscussion and so your app is reallyjust augmenting the conversationcreating a new dimension to what's goingon in the augment framework your app canbe either single player or multiplayerand what we mean with that is either forjust a single person's use or foreveryone in the meeting the focusframework previously that's amultiplayer only experience so examplesof multiplayerexperiences in the sidebar would bethings like you want to take notes as agroup you want to track tasks as a groupproject plan something out or you canplay an icebreaker together which iswhat our partner pully here is doing umor you could even listen to a playlisttogether single player examples for thesidebar are things like taking notesjust for yourself or touching on some ofthe things that Patrice was just talkingabout around individualized personalizedmeeting coaching and giving reallypowerful insight to the user right whenit matters themost all right because meet is thisamazing crossplatform real timecollaboration app we would love to seeyou build crossplatform and really meetyour users where they are irrespectiveof the operating system they happen tobe in so this is why we also buildmobile add-ons sdks that power theadd-ons experiences on Android andiOS no matter what platform you aregoing to use these sdks in these allowyou to supercharge meet bringproductivity collaboration andconnection to a whole new level for yourusers and meet them right where they areso you might wonder how are users goingto find these experiences where arepeople going to see my app in need sothere are many ways are billions ofusers discover add-on in workspace andI'll cover some of them here in terms ofmeet right now so there are twomechanisms to find add-ons and meetitself the first is in our activitiespanel where users can discover installand launch the add-on right from ourside panel just a few clicks to giveauthorization account selection andyou're in this amazing immersiveexperience and the second way is when auser screen shares your app just the waythey would normally present some contentto the meeting meet will recognize thatthe app is built as an add-on and beable to promote installation orcollaborative mode right when it mattersthemost all right this is anchored in ourintegration with the workspaceMarketplace which users can access infull from our UI without ever having toleave it so this means you're not onlygoing to Delight your existing user baseby building an add-on but you're alsoable to tap into Google meets user baseand maybe do new user acquisition inthisway the Third Way a user can discoveradd-ons is in the Google workspaceMarketplace itself so users can go tothe workspace Marketplace in any browserinstall the add-on in advance of comingto meet and because the installation isat the account level as soon as theinstall moment happens the add-on isautomatically available across all ofthe platform forms that you may havebuiltfor one of the many reasons weintegrated it with the Google workspaceMarketplace is because we know it adminsneed to install and manage add-ons fortheircustomers and the marketplace adminconsole makes this seamless easy andgives the level of oversight and controlthat we know our customers need so we'reexcited to be a new dimension in theworkspace marketplace with meet add-onsall right so now you've seen theopportunity for you you've seen the kindof experience for your users the nextquestion is what does it take to makethis happen is this a lot of work so forthat one of our Eng leads is going tocome up Patrick and tell you all aboutthis allright thanks Ma umas as my said um we're now going to gothrough what it takes to actually buildone of these add-ons my team and otherteams throughout workspace have beenworking for many months to to do this soI'm really excited to to show you how todo this and and represent their workhere we're going to do this in in threeeasy steps so the first thing we'regoing to do is create the add-on uhthere in Google Cloud console then we'regoing to write the code we'll go througha few code Snippetsum it's not that much so it we should bepretty pretty easy to do and thenfinally we're going to actually installthe add-on and run through a demo hereon stage fingers crossed hope everythinguh goes Super well uh La demos are a lotoffun so because we're a Google workspaceaddon the first thing to do is go to theAPI and services section of the cloudconsole and enable the Google workspaceMarketplace SDK as well as the Googleworkspace addons APIonce you've done that you can go toAlternative run times where you canactually um set up your um yourdeployment uh. Json if you already havebuilt a Google workspace um Marketplacelike Addam you should this should befairly familiar to you and you may alsoknow that you can also do this throughthe appscript console so there you'lljust add a meet section to yourdeployment. Json that will allow you toadd meet to an existing add-on this isgreat because you can take advantage ofbundling and so if users have alreadyinstalled your add-on for drive orcalendar they'll automatically get it inmeet so here's what our deploymentDeacon looks like right there in thecloud console and we can zoom in alittle bit on that so you'll see there'stwo uh main sections there we've got ourcommon section and our meat section thecommon section is the same across allGoogle workspace add-ons the meatsection is where it gets interesting uhas my mentioned we have have severaldifferent platforms that we supportwe're going to talk about web todaybecause it's sort of the mostapproachable here um so you'll see wehave support screen sharing which meansthat when you're in that sort of focusflow and things are in the main stageyou can screen share it we'll show thatin the demo later and then the sidepanel URI this points to an app uh thatI built on fire paace for thisdemonstration today it can be hostedanywhere Firebase and other gcp placesare good choice um but it can really behostedanywhere all right and that's all thesetup in Cloud console now we canactually talk about the code which I'mbiased but is the fun part um so thefirst thing you'll do is include the SDKthen you'll initialize uh the add-onwe'll walk through that and finally setthe collaboration state which is we'llyou know take a user event and then setthat so that we can get everybody in thesame place um in the main stage whenstart activity isclicked so to include uh the SDK youjust include this JavaScript path it'sas simple as that that's all there is toit um we use latest because we like tolive dangerously but we'll have versionsand everything likethat um then we initialize the add-onclient uh and context so the you'llnotice that we pass in a cloud projectnumber this is the same Cloud projectnumber that we just of the project thatwe just used to set up our deployment.Json and so we'll pass in that projectnumber to create the context and thenwe'll create a side panel client this isjust the part of the add-on that'srunning in the side panel if we had amain stage you could also initialize amain stage client so your application'sgoing to be aware of where it is andhere we just do it right on body on loadso it happens as soon as the pagecompletesloading then we're going to setcollaboration starting state so youyou'll see we do this on the um on anevent when the input changes so we havea little text area whenever it changeswe just set our new collaborationstarting State before the collaborationbegins we can set this as many times aswe want um so we do it um there uh andso it returns a promise so we we awaitit there and that's it that's all ittakes to build one of these add-ons umin your page sort of using you knownormal standards uh around HTML andJavaScript that everyone is fairlycomfortable on the web um and so onceyou're done with that you can go back tothe Google Cloud console and try thingsout in developer mode so you can have wesupport multiple deployments there soyou can have a test a staging aproduction instance and then you couldhave people in development do thosedeveloper installs and then when you doit you'll see that uh next demo add-onwould appear right there in your meet uhactivitiespanel uh andnow we're going to give it a shot soI'll invite my back up and we'll see ifwe can uh get things going there and soI think we need demo one and we'll gofromhere allright all right so you'll see we're herejoined from our laptops andeverything and so the first thing I'lldo is open up the activitiespanel and you'll see that we've got umI'll hit the get add-ons button whichwill take us to themarketplace and you'll see right hereI've got our nice demo add-on that wewere just goingthrough I will install it it'll take methrough just one account selectionthing and then boom we'reinstalled so we'll click our add-on andyou'll see I built a little thing wherewe just do a Wikipedia search togetherso so what do we like to search we'regoing to search for Google I want tolearn a little more about thatcompany and so then we'll hit startactivity and you'll see this opens upWikipedia um which is blessedly ifframable um and you can we can kind ofscroll around look at it together I caneven uh share my screen and you'll seeit only shares this region of the screento everyone in the meeting so if peoplecan't join your meeting for whateverjoin your uh collaboration in in theadd-on for whatever reason they'll beable to see the experience even if theycan't gointeractive uh and so we'll switch overactually now to demo 2 so you can seewhat it looks like for a participant inthemeeting all rightso here wesee Wikipedia because Patrick is screensharing here's my prompt to installadd-on so I'm going to clickthat and looks just like how it did onPatrick'sscreen going to click myaccount and it'sinstalling not as fast as on Patrick'smachinewoohoo all right here I am in Wikipediascrolling along with Patrick andlearning all about Googletogether so Patrick is going to end theactivity and here we are and and that'sit that's it all right we can switchback switch back to theslides all right so you can see withjust a little bit of code and a littlebit of configuration you can bring anexperience right into meet and so we'rereally excited um to see what folks willbuild and um we it's been great workingwith our first set of Partners um onthis integration so a few things umfirst of all if you want to hear aboutthis and more things across meets umplatform and across workspace platformgo ahead and join the developer previewprogram um take a look at our growingCommunity YouTube channel everythinglike that um the first set of add-ons uhfor me for our partners should be comingout in the coming days so pay attentionto meet and the changes that um that gothere um and our the as far as the SDwe're currently in Early Access um forthat"
