you to reimagine what'spossible on vertex AIlater in the sessionGoogle developer Advocate gonna give youa good demo about grounding and also ona new project that we just startedthings that you haven't seen from ourSpotlight sessions and Keynotes we'realso so thrilled to have cotton SabaraVP of product management and for Kivaand Adam Smithdirector of strategic partnership atJasper AI joining us on the stage totalk about their Journey with palm APIbut first let me walk you through abrief introduction on large languagemodel and palm 2.what are large laundry model or llmstraditional natural language processingand models are trained to solve aspecific taskssay for example you want to train a newsclassification model you want to gathersay 2 000 training examples of the newsarticle and Associated categorywith large launcher model however youcan simply ask the model hey what isnews article is about that sounds verymagical rightbecause it has great capability onxeroshop and fuel shop meaning you don'thave to train the model with thousandsof examples and morein fact these models are already trainedwith a lot of a lot of data across manysources billions of data pointsthat's the reason the model cangeneralize a lot of capability in onesingle artifactGoogle has been a Pioneer in this spacein 2017 we published paper attention isall you need this groundbreaking work inTransformer and diffusion model are thebasis for almost all generated AIapplications you see todayin 2018 we published model Bertlooking from today this is still one ofthe most often used model in naturallanguage understandingfast forward to 2023 we launched Palm 2at Google I O our next Generation stateof art large language modelyou may wonder what does Palm stands forPalm is short for pathway language modelit is Google's Vision to create a singlemodel that could not only generalizeacross tasks but also domainsand at the same time being highly highlyefficientthrough the Palm API we give you directaccess to the underlying model so thatyou don't have to worry about scaling upor scaling down this fully managed theservicethe answer also unblock multilingualcapability reasoning and coding taskso indoor palm we have two mainofferingsupon API for text and pump API for chatfor text it's a fine-tuned model that isgreat at both generative andnon-generative taskssuch as classification and thedestruction summarization contentgeneration and editingfor a chat it is a multi-turn interfaceto help you to track the history and thecontext as you conduct theseconversationswe launched these two models into GA twomonths agoand we have seen a lot of developers andcompanies reading great applications ontop of the model and our platformthis change actually applied to all theindustries and all the customers so lasttime when I see a technology with such awide capability is probably the internetso that's why we believe this is apivotal point in technology where thingsare not possible four or five years agobecome a reality todaywe at Google feel so fortunate and alsovery excited to work with developerscustomers Partners closelyto have the opportunity innovatetogether in this spaceEnterprise Readiness it is our coreto approach generative AI customers havefull control of the dataso you have Enterprise grade capabilitysuch as data prevention data losspreventiondata isolationdata compliance as wellGoogle is also the first companypublished AI principle that governs howwe build AI products and how we bringthis technology to the marketwe have a series of updates in thisspace that would like to share with youin a minute we also have a dedicatedsession about our architectural designsecurity architecture our approach toadaptation tuning in in much much moredetails so if that is an interest to youI highly recommend you join that sessionor watch the replaynow without further Ado let me roll outall the new featuresfirst and foremost the models we'reintroducing four new models into thelatest Channelby latest I mean you can call thesemodels for prediction without specifyinga version IDin our early testing and early customerfeedback we see great Improvement on thenew four models across all taskswe also added a 32k long context windowto the model so if you process a longfinancial documents contracts or youwant to process like a transcription ofa you know podcastyou don't have to chunk the inputanymoreand in addition to that we also addedthe support for additional 30 alanguages into GA and over 90 languagesinto public previewour improved safety future will protectthe use of palm 2 across all the modelsand all the languagesone more thing I want to count out wealso have a recitation Checker so thatwe would detect any overlap between themodel output and the well-known sourcessecond we're trying to make our platformeven easier to use we added a streamingfeature now supporting text chat andco-modelswith account token API you can count thenumber of tokens and billable charactersbefore calling into our predictionendpointwe added two more model parameters stoptokens and number of samples so you havemore control of the model output and youcan get more out of one single requestif you're running a nine time sensitivejob so you process a product catalog ofa million or you want to run asummarization job of a call centerovernightbatch prediction is the way to go we cansupport up to a hundred thousand promptsin one single requestand then we have a plan to expand thisto 1 million perhapsthrough my conversation with customersand early testers we know tuning is acritical capabilityit helps the model to perform a lotbetter on specific tasks and specificprompts without retraining the entirebase modeltoday we are launching tuning for textmodel in GA and tuning for chat model inpublic previewwe have some great results from earlytesting with customers with a Spiel as ahundred examples and I cannot waitto see what type of the new applicationsand new experiences that you can createon top of the tuning capabilitymany of us know one of the secret saucethat we see the large length model keepimproving is through reinforcementlearning with human feedbackat Google Cloud we will not use yourdata to improve Google foundationalmodelyour data is your data however we'retrying to make this fantastic frameworkavailable to you so you can deploy it toThe Right Use casewith the Right audience within oroutside your organizationgeneration Studiothat has been the testing ground for alot of you to experiment and evaluateour modelsnow we are making it even easier toprototype across the entire model lineupwith all the new parametersall the changes that we talk about todayis already live by now so I hope youhave a lot of fun playing with us afterthis sessionas I mentioned earlier EnterpriseReadiness is at the core of our approachto generate AItoday we are announced our Palm API tosupport additional security featuressuch as data residency arrest virtualprivate cloud service controland customer encryption key Etcand with this Enterprise Readinessfeature we want you to feel a hundredpercent confident that you can run themost critical business workload on PalmAPI and vertex AIfor more you can check out ourdocumentation pagefrom Thomas keynote you might heargrounding multiple timeswe see grounding as a key element of ourproduct experience and we know this froma lot of a customer like youHallucination is one of the top concernsso we created Enterprise groundingservice that works across vertex AIfoundational models search andconversationso the support for Palm API is now inprivate previewanother cool feature I want to shareis called extended contacts API so it isour vision to support unlimited contactswindowso as a developer you don't have toworry about how to track the inputand as a modeler you don't have to worryabout the quality degradation as thesize of the window increasewe are testing this with a few customersand we see great resultsso this feature and the groundingfeature are still in private but don'tworry following gonna show you some livedemo about thislast but not least with the new modelswe are also introducing new pricingbuilding on top of Google advanced TPUand GPU infrastructure we're constantlypushing the boundary of efficiencyoptimizationstoday we are announcing a 50 productprice reduction on our online predictioncallso if you compare it with competitors atthe same price point you get double sizeof the contacts windowif you're running a non-time sensitivejob on batch you can further benefitfrom our optimization with another 20cheaperwe're running out this new pricingstarting early September and I hope withthe new pricing you can unlock unlock alot of new use cases that people havenever imagined beforeand these are all the new updates webring to the Palm API now I will pass itto Hong Kong to show you some live demohello everyone my name is Paul long Linand I'm a developer Advocate at Googlecloud and my focus is on genitive AI soI'm going to be talking about two demoshere that Lewis has mentioned one ongrounding with Enterprise search and thesecond one on Q a with extended contextAPI and I'm so excited to show these twodemos I think for the first timepublicly okay so let's get started nowwith the grounding uh so grounding withLMS attempt to solve two problems as asyou may know a grounding solves theproblem of uh so allowing the llm toaccess uh Enterprise or proprietary orinternal documents so that's one and thesecond one is attempting to mitigatehallucinations by granting with yourproprietary or internal documents or ordata so I'm going to show you an exampleof here with grounding with Enterprisesearch now you can build your owngrounding applications uh from scratchon your own but I'm going to show youhow you can create this uh in minutesusing grounding with Enterprise searchand this is a fantastic tool on onGoogle Cloud so imagine that uh you knowyou are a an employee of this fictitiouscompany called symbol bank and symbolBankum there's lots of new employees thatare being onboarded all the time tosimbo bank and so there's a number ofdifferent sort of onboarding relateddocuments that's specific to symbol banknow again this is all fictitiousinformation uh these are just PDFs thatI have actually just uploaded to GoogleCloud Storage now there's informationhere specific to symbol Bank thisfictitious company around how to booktravel using tools like symbol flysymbol stay to book your hotel uh it'sauthored by Lewis symbol who is thefounder and CEO of this fictitiouscompany so now that we have all thesePDFs in Google Cloud Storage thequestion becomes how do we brand ourlarge language model how do we groundPalm so that we can ask Palm questionsbased off of the content of these PDFsso let's walk through that example withEnterprise search so I'm going to gointo example of how to build that appthat search app with Enterprise searchhere so I can click on new app hereunder uh gen app builder gen app builderand I'm clicking here on new appand I'm going to give this app a namelet this load here a little bit sothere's different apps that you cancreate with Gen app Boulder but here I'mchoosing search because we want tocreate a search on top of the PDFs thatwe have in cloud storage and I'll setthe the parameters here to be defaultbut I'll give it a name like symbol mfor employee and then give it a locationhere to be the US and then I'll clickhere continue and now at this point I'mgoing to creating a data store so whatexactly is a status store this is whereI'll be importing the data from thatcloud storage bucket with those PDFsabout symbol bank so I can choose fromother sources as well from website URLsfrom data in bigquery as well I canchoose from cloud storage my PDFs mydocs my text files I can even importdata from an API as well but in thiscase because my PDFs are in cloudstorage I'll click on cloud storage andI'll point to that folder where I hadpreviously uploaded all of the PDF fileshere so it'll load here just in a secondsymbol employee onboarding is my bucketI'll select that and I'll go ahead andclick on continue and I can give my datastore a name data store symbol and clickcreate now I've actually created thisapp already here because it takes acouple minutes to import these files soI've created this app right here calledsymbol employee onboardand as you see below here I've actuallynow imported these five PDFs into mysearch app using Enterprise search so Icould ask some fairly basic questionsdirectly within Enterprise search underthis preview button here and I could asksome questions like who is the CEO of uhsymbol bank again let me try that who isthe CEO of symbol Bank and I think uhyou know Palm API would not know theanswer to this because this thisinformation is locked away in the PDFsand it will say ah Lewis symbol is a CEOand it will also provide citations ofthe PDFs where it's gotten thisinformation from as well so this isgreat for trivia related sort ofquestions based off of the knowledgewithin this content but then what if Iwant to shape this prompt to be a littlebit morefluid to be more creative with my promif I want to try different things likewrite emails and generate emails uhabout some of these tools in symbol bankor something like that so let's moveover to uh generative AI studio with thePalm API and I'll ask a question likegenerate an email to remind employees touse internal tools for Biz travel andI'm not mentioning symbol bank here inthis prompt here at all right so I canfirst of all disable enable groundingclick on submit and I'll get a responsethat's going to be very generic becauseagain the Palm API doesn't know thisinformation from symbol bank so it givesa very generic response you know Highyou know dear employees I hope thisemail finds you well and then it hasnothing to do with simple bank but hereis a little toggle Button as you sawearlier right enable grounding enablebranding with Source Enterprise searchand what I've done here is I've added inthe data store where we've importedthose PDFs into here and I've clickedsave here and I'll just enable groundingand if I ask the same questionhopefully it will return an email that'sspecific oh I think you need to do itonce more enable it click submit it'llgive me an email specific to symbol bankand it's going to be related to symbolbank here oh I might need to change thisprompt a little bit for internal toolsfor symbol Bankand then it should give us a responserelated to symbol Drive symbol state andsymbol travel heresymbol fly symbol expense symbol workthese are all specific tools uh found inthose documents and now this responsefrom the Palm API is indeed groundedusing our Enterprise search app so herewe go there's a fantastic way to groundyour app in just minutes without havingto set up your own Vector database worryabout embeddings worry about chunkingyou can just point and click point toyour your data in bigquery your APIcloud storage and then ground yourprompts so that you can get responsesgrounded based off of your own internaland proprietary data so this isgrounding with Enterprise search okayand this is the first demo but I'm goingto actually go to another demo here aswell and I go through some of thesescreenshots Okay sothis here is a very very long documentnow imagine that you are a company andyou're not quite ready to build a wholesearch engine on on your on yourproprietary data you may have some verylong form documents here so here is theSEC filing for Google about itsexpenditure with the security andSecurities and Exchange Commission theSEC or the 10K form right this is howGoogle spend its money I believe in 2004and it's a very it's a very longdocument right I'm scrolling here I'mnot even halfway through it's a verylong document so as you saw earlier uhtext bison now can support up to 32 000uh tokens uh previously it was at 8 000tokens and this here is over 100 000tokens it's a very very long document sohow can we ask questions about thisdocument as quickly and as easily aspossible well we can use uh the extendedcontext API right and this is anexperimental so I'm going to be runningthis live here I'm going to be importinguh the text bison uh SDK here and I'mgoing to be asking the question whatwere Google's RND expenses in 2004 andit's going to find this answer withinthe document I'm going to run this nowhere live for you what how much workGoogle's r d expenses in 2004 I'mpassing in the final pass to thatparticular text file with the prompt andwithin 7.07 seconds it gives us theparagraphs most related to the questionmost related to the question now this isnot passing it to the Palm API yet rightso these are three to four paragraphs ofthe most relevant sort of contacts fromwithin the original file so then I cantake these three to four paragraphs andthen combine this context with myoriginal question and ask the polym APIso if I run this again here with thisthree to four paragraphs as the contextand ask it'll say Google's r d expensesin 2004 were 225.6 million now was thatcorrect because I have a bit of a trustdistrust relationship with llms you justkind of want to validate everything hereand if I if I look here ah indeed itsays here research and developmentexpenses increased by 134.4 million to225.6 million okay let's go back to theoriginal document here from the SECfiling and search for it and it isactually from there so it's getting thatfactual grounded information from theoriginal filing but this document isonly over just over a hundred thousandtokens what if we use one of the largestuh one of the largest books that I'veever been uh written War and Peaceum 792 000 tokens and what if we were toask a very sort of almost specificquestion what did Mason say after Pierresaid something about human intelligenceall right so Mason and Pierre are twocharacters in War and Peace and you'llnotice here and I'm gonna actually startrunning this because this will take alittle bit of time here humanintelligence all right humanintelligence if I go back to this theactual file itself this so this is thewarrant piece file from ProjectGutenberg and I can scroll down all theway throughand this is a massive massive text file792 000 tokens and if I actually lookfor the term human intelligence it'sactually nowhere to be found in thistext file it's got human so I can seethere's different instances of humanbeing said Intelligence being set herebut human intelligence is not a phrasethat ever appears in this War and Peacebookso uh here I'm running what did Masonsay after and also with the intentionaltypo after uh Pierre said somethingabout human intelligence and here I passin war and peace.txt which is that samefile and this will take approximatelyfrom calling it to the end around 55seconds and we'll see here just a littlebit 55.39 seconds and it gives us thisanswer uh incredibly three to fourparagraphs and it found this probably inshorter time than it would be for me toscroll through the entire book of Warand Peace so then I can pass this to thePalm API and I'll say given thefollowing information from the book Warand Peace as context below answeranswer the user question so I'll passthis to the Palm API and what will itsay it'll say the Mason said that thehighest wisdom and Truth are like thepurest liquid we may wish to imbibe orto drink to to drink the purest liquidto wish to to drink so if I were to copythis uh interesting phrase purest liquidand I do a search again and it says Ahokay so I indeed Pierre is talking to toMason uh and then so it says somethingthe Mason smiled with this gentlefar-lew smile the purest liquid which wemay wished in Vibe so if I were to copyand copy that little phrase go back toWar and Peace is this War and Peace nothis is one piece and I look for it andit's it's really directly from theoriginal book itself so we've done thissort of like searching for a needle in ahaystack but in fact we we asked forthis question right what did Mason sayafter Pierre said something about humanintelligence this phrase didn't appearat all in the original book so it'salmost like we're searching forsomething that looks like a needle inthe haystack and it's able to retrievethat within a minute across almost 800000 tokens which is honestly quiteincredibleum so you might also wonder what if Palmalready knew the answer without thecontext right so maybe Palm alreadyknows this answer so if we were to askpom directly without the context it'llgive a completely different responsesince Mason said that human intelligenceis a product of evolution and so on andagain also if we were to scroll back upto the SEC question did the uh Palm EPAalready know Google's r d expenses in2004. if it were to ask that question toPalm API oh that's the the cached onelet me go back up here to the originaloneand then uh call us over here again it'sgoing to say something like uh one onebillion or something completelyinaccurate because it was not groundedright so 1.1 billion is what Palm APIthinks Google's r d expenses were in2004 but that's not grounded because itdoesn't have that context from the SECfiling so that is the end of uh thesetwo uh these two demosum so I'm gonna pass this over to ournext speaker Gautam and so thank you somuch for these demos[Applause]hi everyone I'm Gautam subrau I leadproduct management for machine learningat work Eva that was an exciting set ofannouncements and what I'm going to bedoing here for the next few minutes isshowing you all of that in a real worldapplication and how we're approachinggenerative AI at work Cuba but before Igo dive into how are we leveraging palmand vertex AI I want to spend a littlebit of time giving you a little bit ofinformation about what is working aboutwho are we and what do we do right whereCuba is the only unified platform forassured integrated reporting we arepurpose built for financial reportingenvironmental social and governance orESG reporting and then the third one isgovernance risk and compliance or GRCreporting you remember the example thatPaul long showed about SEC filings thatis just one of the many things that wehelp our customers manage on ourplatform right so at the the other thingI want to highlight is we help ourcustomers bring together their peopleprocesses and their data in a securecontrol and most importantly and thenauditory environmentoh sorry wrong directionum to tell you a little bit more aboutour user base we serve about 5 800customers uh 230 000 platform users and17 different countries around the worldin fact 85 percent of Fortune 500companies are working best customersright and we serve a very very broad setof industries that range from bankingenergy media and entertainment PharmaAutomotive just to name a few uh thereso before I go into why are weinterested in generative and what are wedoing about it let me share a glimpse ofwhat our customers challenges are andwhy is this relevant for our particularindustry right productivity is top ofmind for a lot of CFOs today and that'sdriven by four four major Trends uhmacro trends that are at play here thefirst one is there's actually increaseddemand for transparency from uh thestakeholders of our customers right andthis is happening in an environmentwhere there's increased regulation wherethe volume and variety of data that ourcustomers have to report on is exploringand then on top of it there's an acuteshortage of accounting and financeprofessionals right so this makes itreally hard to get productivity gains inan environment like this and this isalso the reason why over 70 percent ofthe CFOs are looking at emerging AITechnologies such as generative AI to beadopted in their Finance functionswithin the next 12 months rightso at workiva we believe we have anopportunity to not just transform but torevolutionize business reporting rightand I'm going to introduce ourgenerative AI approach here by showingyou a quick video on how we're goingabout thislet's play the video heredo you have the audioso why is it exactly it's a securegenerative AI productivity partnerdesigned to help you by creating andimproving content summarizing your hardwork and fast tracking your decisionmaking process but how does it do allthat the new generative AI experiencecan be leveraged within workivadocuments spreadsheets and presentationsplus via chat across the entire workivaplatformlet's say you need help creating aremediation template for an accountspayable control failure simply drop acommand into the prompt box from hereyou can edit your starting content bychoosing to shorten elaborate rephrasecreate headlines and more when you'rehappy with the output click copy orinsert and the feature will place thecontent into whatever you're working onsupercharging your efficiency andproductivity you can also leveragegenerative AI in chat as a quick way toresearch and brainstorm simply click onthe AI chat icon in the lower rightcorner to get started let's say you'relooking to create a stakeholderengagement plan for your ESG program butyou're not really sure where to startyou can just ask about it in the chatonce again you have the ability tofurther refine the information generatedbased on your requirements when it'sready copy and paste the content allwithout interrupting your workflow orsharing information externallyyou can also highlight the contentyou're working on right click and hoverover the generative AI in the menu thereyou'll see a number of helpful optionschoose the option that fits your needsin this case we'll try to elaborate thisgives you even more content to work withand in a matter of seconds the newstakeholder engagement plan is takingshapeour generative AI experience providesthe same level of security and assurancethat workiva is known for you can feelconfident knowing that your data andprompts are not used to train the modelinputs and responses from generative AIare encrypted and not stored beyond thechat session now that's a reliefall right so let's spend a little bit oftime unpacking this I'll share with youour approach and how we've tackled thisproblem of incorporating generative AIonto our platform right so let's startwith an example here as soon as a userputs in a prompt into our generative AIexperience the very first thing we do iswe actually run a filter we run a filterto eliminate any off-limit prompts thata user might be asking right so that'sthe very first step right after that weapply a set of guardrails guard railscan be in the form of traditionalcontext uh wherein the application is auser what are they trying to do and alsoPersona types in terms of what's the theperson or the intent of the user so thathelps anchor responses that you can getwith cumulative AI the third thing youheard uh Lewis and Poland talk aboutgrounding right so we do grounding in acouple of different ways the first thingis we actually leverage embeddings andthen retrieval augmented generation notjust onboard keywords proprietary databut we can also do the same thing forour customers workspace data so thatthey can get contact specificinformation on their own documents rightwe also do this in the form of templatesso that if a customer wants responses ina specific templatized form that's alsopossible using the the groundingfunction IAM authorization this is onethat comes up quite often with ourcustomers in terms of Are We servingresponses that somebody is notauthorized to see that is the reason whyeven in the grounding phase we look atIM authorization and just just to makesure that only users who are allowed tolook at specific documents are able togenerate responses from that particulardocument or even sections of thatdocument right and the final thing iscitations and references right rag is avery efficient technique in terms of usbeing able to not just anchor ourresponses in our documents but to alsoserve citations to our customers to seewhere did these responses come fromespecially if it's coming from eitherour proprietary data or their own dataso once we do that the next step isinjection so we take all of thatinformation along with that we actuallyapply as set of our own prompts in orderto simplify the customer's experience oruser experience you saw for example anumber of commands there right in termsof short and evaporate so we feed all ofthat as prompts behind the scenes sothat the user just has to click a set ofbuttons to actually make use of some ofthese capabilities and then we also havefine tune as a set of model parametersthat we feed in to the model so thatevery single user doesn't have to godeal with these model parameters such astemperature for example right so that'sall pre-populated here and then once wedo that we actually leverage both chatbison and text bison right so both thePalm 2 models depending on the theexperience that a customer is going forin our platform we leverage both ofthose to server response once theresponse is generated the other thing wedo is we run another set of filters tomake sure that there's nothing in theresponse that is off limits right soonce all of this is done we serve theresponses back to the user so that'swhat you saw in the video here in just aminutethen lastly I want to spend a little bitof time telling you about why are weexcited about some of the announcementsthat Lewis and bolong just made here uhyou you saw the demo on SEC documentsright so these large token sizes this isgoing to be a game changer for us itgreatly simplifies the ability toprocess large documents in a single stepyou don't have to chunk documents weavoid that step entirely uh tuningtuning is a big deal for us right it'snot just for us to make our models moreresponsive uh you know not just in termsof performance but if you think about itin the form of building an ecosystemwith our partners this becomes veryimportant capability for us to have tohave multiple people participate in ourecosystem to extend some of ourfoundation not not just Foundationmodels but also the extensions that wecould build for them multilingualmulti-region this is also a big deal forus this helps us take generative air notjust from North America but we can nowsearch this capability to our customersin India and in APAC as well and thenlastly batch prediction right so if youhave to run schedule and pass repetitivepass say for example you're writing anarrative summary on your audit testingevery so often right well we could batchprocess a lot of that's when you come inthe morning you have a ready Narrativeof what's going on with your controltest for example so those are just someof the reasons why we are super excitedabout the new announcements in in Palmtoowith that if you would like to learnmore about our approach to generative AIcheck out workiva.com generative AI I'mgoing to be here in the room right afterthe presentation feel free to come by uhhappy to answer any questions that youmight have with that I will pass it overto Adam Adamhello hello everyone my microphone isworking okay hey everybody one more demowe'll get you out of here on time myname is Adam Smith I work at Jasper weare the AI co-pilot for marketersum Jasper's been in the market for abouttwo and a half years now uh using llmsto show value to our customers we've gota broad customer base of digital nativesEnterprise agencies and we're continuingto invest in a growing engineering teamto maintain our leadership in the spaceour customers see value in creatingcontent with increased velocity and moreoutput campaigns that used to take fourto six weeks they're now seeing theiraccomplishing in one to two weeks orachieving three times the output in thesame amount of time these are the typesof value metrics that we live in everydayso how does Jasper workum Jasper is a SAS application it runsonly on Google cloud and uses the bestof vertex AI The patent-pending JasperAI engine it really optimizes AI outputquality for each use case combiningpersonalization and memory features aswell as Integrations to ground in Googlesearch resultsenhance with SEO tools and more TheJasper AI engine also does model fittingat scale for each use case from avariety of language models language andimage Foundation models including thelatest Palm to text bisonwe call these personalization featuresJasper brand voice a non-technical usercan teach Jasper their Brand's uniquetone and style their style guide and anyfactual knowledge about their businessthings like product brief PDFs or pressreleases or even just URLs for Jasper toscrapeall this data is yours and we never useany of it to train third-party modelsso let me just show you a demo hereJasper demos much more funum play along with me as I talk over myrecorded demo I got nervous with theWi-Fi Vibe here and so I just recordedit but I'm going to talk over it liveall right soum in this case I'm going to be adigital marketer for a fictitiouscompany again called Alto Strat and Iwant to create some assets For anupcoming campaign but before I do thatI'm going to go to this brand voicesectionum in this section I've set my corporatetone of voice we're a Shoe Company AltoStrat kicks so we want to be cool andtrendy and relatable to the youngergeneration using slang and emojis andmemesum so I'll save this and I can use itthroughout Jasper and I also want toupload some knowledge here so I can justclick on knowledge and I'm going toupload a campaign brief that really isthe two three page summary of thislaunch of our coolest newest sneaker yetum so once we have that done let's goover and we're going to start a campaignso I'm going to call this campaign Altostratkicks I'm going to select thecampaign voice that we just set up thereand I'm going to upload uh this thissame product brief as the contextso once we have all that done we're justgoing to go ahead and select what assetsthat we want to create so a blog postsome Google ads and my various socialassets here uh so we can get to the kidsso we're just going to click generatecampaign and Jasper is going to Outputall these Assets in a shared campaignfolder where my team can continue tocollaborate but let's drill into one ofthese uh we'll drill into the blog postin the editoryou know there's always the need for thehuman touch here in all content creationso I'm going to review this I like theoutput here the pump is back and betterthan ever let's pump up your game even aCheesy disclaimer at the end there whilethe kicks May provide an unexpectedboost actual dunking results May Varybut you know I'm gonna ask Jasper justto rewrite this closing paragraph with abetter call to action so we'll type abetter CTA in the closing paragraphno you know I don't like that one let'slet's just do one more so we're going totry again okay let's choose to replacethis as our new CTA we'll just fix theformatting here and move onso I can always open Jasper chat on theleft here as a as a research tool Jasperchat is grounded in in Google searchresultsso I can use it for research I can askJasper in this case what made ReebokPumps so popular in the 80sand I can either enhance that promptthere with which is a nice little trickto to write a better prompt but we'rejust going to send it here and you'llsee that Jasper will cite sources in theoutput that are from Google searchresultsanything that I that I pull up in chathere I can pop over to the document solet's just do that here as a frame ofreferenceokay now I want to create some productdescriptions for my websitefor that I'm going to go to createcontent and the product descriptionstemplate so Jasper have a variety of outof the box templates here that reallyobfuscate the need
