    "transcript": "foreign[Music]welcome to the this section toincreasing develop productivity andcapability with uh duet AIso my name is Marcus product managerwithin Google Cloud specifically focusedon our developer tools working on duetAI for developers in Cloud code and I'mjoined by Shrestha and Emily todayI'm a product manager in Google Labsworking on code AI across all ofGoogle's coding serviceshi I'm Emily Roth and I work for Wayfairas a senior software engineer on ourengineering enablement teamall right let's jump into the agenda fortoday so we'll start by talking aboutoverview of what is uiti specific focuson developer tools then talk a bit aboutwhat problems they solve so why whyfolks will consider using a direct AIthen move on to a quick products Deepdive and followed by a demo and then aquick overview of the Wayfair Journeyevaluating and incorporating duet AI ontheir internal workflows rightso okay what is duet AI right so as youfolks likely saw in some previoussessions the key idea here is infusingAI throughout the Google Cloudexperience right so this means yes theconsole bigquery editor essentially allthe services you may go to as adeveloper including for example IDs suchas vs code or jetbrains IDs right so thekey idea here to have models whichsupport a general purpose programmingtasks so if you do all your regulardevelopment on duet but they're alsooptimized for gcp specific tests to befamiliar with our client librariesterraform all the dialects which arespecific to uh Google Cloud right so andyou can see here essentially what itlooks like essentially this isessentially showing vs code running aduet that case showing a code suggestionuh here right so moving on so as Imentioned duet is a portfolio ofproducts the key idea here is BuildingSolutions which are tailored to specificpersonas or audiences within your Kingright so here you can see the five mainaudiencesshould they be focusing on the green oneassistive development the key idea hereis meeting developers where they areessentially in their ID the code editorand giving them tools which are AIpowered to help improve theirproductivity so we can do the same withless less time less context switchingand less overhead but also enhancingcapability and empowering developersessentially allowing you to do thingswhich will be otherwise out of rich ortoo complex imagine for exampleintegrating a new API you never heardabout before without having to spendhours going documentation learn aboutthe syntax and more quickly get intofrom zero to hello world to integratedto my production application that's oneneck ones the blue uh one is aboutassistive operations the key idea hereis essentially it's a chat within thecloud console allowing to perform taskstypical of operators such as hey help meunderstand uh my deployments or myinfrastructure via natural languagequeries I hope you get suggestions forhow to optimize for my course from aperformance or from a usage by the stewthree is assistive data that's veryfocused on data engineering essentiallyimagine essentially the person whospends a good chunk of their timereading or writing SQL query the ideahere is it takes the shape of an AIassistance inside the bigquery editorwhich helps you things such asnavigating your data sources or writingSQL queries or reading understanding SQLqueries and so on so forththe fourth one here is assistive no codedevelopment this is very focused on theEnterprise to employee kind of use caselet's say for example you are working onbuilding a internal application forbenefits management or some internal usecase DJ here is giving you a no codeinterface within app sheets where youcan converse with a chatbot and get torunning a running applicationimplementing business logic withouthaving to write a code or be exposed tocode directly and last but not leastassistive security the key idea here isa series of features focus on detectingand helping mitigate potential securitythreats as well as helping preventlateral movements after securityinstance that's the overview here folkstoday as I mentioned we'll be focused onassistive development the key goal hereis the key features we cover is codecompletion and code generationessentially as you're typing your codeyou may get a single World a single linesuggested in the context of your editorcode generation I mean you explain whatyou the logic once you build viacomments or via function Handler and youget the whole code block or wholefunction generator for you as well as achatbot which essentially allows you toessentially say chats which has thecontext of your ID allows you to performtests such as troubleshooting goodexplanation or test generation via anatural language interfaceis good and one thing I want to mentionhere is duet was built from the groundup the principle of media developerswhere they are right so here you can seethe IDS we support within a duet rightso the key idea here is yes the supportcleric stations clutch literature thenative and the performance gcp has butit also supports vs code or alljetbrains IDs such as IntelliJ Golan Picharm Rider and so on and so on right soout of this is delivered via the cloudcode ID extensions if you install Cloudcode you're getting duet previewedinside of a cloud code and you have thechoice of using your preferred ID hererightokay let me shift gears and talk a bitabout why duet the key challenges we seeyou wear to helping address right sofirst thing you see here is developersfrequently find multiple friction pointson the day-to-day right so here havesome numbers here right so essentiallythe very participated uh too much timegoing through dogs on boarding thechallenge having to find out how to getup to speed or a new code base or a newproject they're knowledge silos we kindof see this camera issues here creatingfictions which diver developers fromspending more time writing code and forspending more time being in the flow inthat productive State developers want tobe right so that's a key idea here I'lltalk about some examples of specificuse cases or customers mentioned whichduet was focused on addressing right sofirst one here let's say you're new toGoogle Cloudand you want to try a new API how can Imore quickly get up to get from I wantto try it out I have Hello Road I'm thenevaluating some methods and then I'mintegrating the application the API toproduction that's one use case heresecond one is how can I uh let's talkabout the writing codedevelopers span same if you're not evensee more time reading reviewing andunderstanding code how can I help getmore up to speed more quickly on an on5meter code baseor Beyond reading how can I help myteams improve their test coveragewithout affecting my velocity orincreasing or increasing my velocityessentially having proper test coverageand proper regression testing and a morerobust testing setup for my applicationunless one which is AI specifics how canI use AI in my workflows why respectingthe IP protection and compliance andsecurity policies my organization has inplace right so there are some realproblems we heard from customers andGoogle in-house also had similarchallenges we meet right so that's whyI'm excited to say that Googleis using duet AI in-house includingproduction usage for day-to-daydevelopment and the key idea here washaving Google be the first customer ofduet helped us build this fasteriteration so I could say hey let's seehow those capabilities can play on thison the setting of a large Enterpriseorganization helped inform our roadmapin our directions for uh duet rightfinally I want to talk a bit about thefeatures we built on duet which arefocused on the Enterprise needs right soa common question we get here is thisduet train its models on my prompterdata short answer is no we do not we'renot even store your uh requests noresponses to your requests and yeah hereis uh insuring your data is essentiallythe duet is a stateless service yourdata has not been used and not theredoesn't have the risk of potentiallybeing made visible to order potentialusersnext one here is the data set used forthe training data set used for Duets isusing only permissively a license codeessentially we try to carve outnon-premely Services license codecommercial license code all of duet ontop of that we also have apost-processing step which anytime duetprovides a suggestion if said suggestionsites codes at length from our sourceswe say hey we flagged that on the ideayou say hey you have a citation herehere is this code which is cited thesource and the licensing impact in thisthe idea here is giving you enoughinformation for you to make a decisionabout how a code completion meets yoursecurity policy policy and also beenable to provide the license attributionin the case on USC MIT or apache2licensed code herecustomers ever have the option ofdisabling completely source of citationslet's see if you want to have have amore aggressive posture you also havethe option of disabling code which hascitations right soyeah so folks that's it for the overviewhere I'll hand over to stressed to giveyou folks a deep dive on the specificfeatures you have on uhthank you Marcosso Marcus already mentioned some of thefeatures so let's go through themum one by oneso the first two features are codecompletion and code generation codecompletion is what it sounds like asyou're typing in your IDE do it autocompletes two to three lines of code foryou and code generation is user invokedso you when you write a comment or afunction header you can actually call doit to generate a significant large blockof code for younow these features may seem simple butthere's a lot of work that goes intothem behind the scenes the firstdecision that we have to make is what isthe right size of model here what we aretrying to balance between is latency andquality so latency is important forexample if you think about codecompletionif we don't show you a suggestion at theright time you'll just keep typing onand in general it's a very poor userexperience if you have to wait for yourAI to help you on the other hand we wantyou to provide the best quality code andat least as of this time while we havevery excellent small models larger themodel better the quality so that's adecision that we have to makethen Marcus alluded to pre-processingand post-processing there's a lot thatgoes in there I'll just give a couple ofexamples so for example for codecompletionyou could have completion when yourcursor is at the end of your code in theIDE but you could have a scenario whereyour cursor is in the middle so you havecode before the cursor and after thecursorso at that point when we are sendingthat information back to the largelanguage model we have to make adetermination in terms of how much ofthe prefix the code before the cursorand how much of the suffix should wesend back to the language model andtypically prefix is more important whatcame before is more important but suffixis important also so that's just one ofmany decisions that need to be made duetalso sends back information such asnames of your source code files theprogramming language you're coding in toensure and maximize the quality of thecode you get backwhen the large language model sends backresponses there are many decisions thereas well for the model might send backmultiple responses at that point do itdecides based on confidence scoreswhat's the best response to showeven for the best response the model maysend back a certain length of responseand typically you know these the sizehere is measured in tokens think of themas word equivalents now the model sendback a certain length but do it maydetermine that out of all the tokens inthere a certain length of tokens are youknow high confidence high quality andthen the remaining tokens not as much sothen do it might proactively truncatethe response that came back from thelarge language model so there's a lotthat goes in here that's do it is doingbehind the scenes and taking what'scoming out of Google's foundationalmodel and uh you know serving it up tocustomers for a much better userexperiencethis next feature hereis a very important featureand field so large language models onoccasion rarelycan emit code that requires licensingnow we have been very careful to trainduet AI on open source high quality codebut even then sometimes that code maystill require license attribution soduet AI will show you the license andthe source of that license at that pointas Marco said you can decide what youwant to do you can use that code butwith proper attribution or you cannotuse that code depending on yourorganization's policyand this is where you know we'reproviding you with the information youneed to code responsibly using do it AIwhat you also don't see on the slide isthat do it also has a lot of safetyguard rails built in to ensure that thecode that's coming out is notproblematic in any wayumnow in addition to code completion andcode generation if I had to list the topthings that customers ask us for codeexplanation and test generation would beright up there in the top five for suremaybe even in the top threewhat explanation is what it sounds likeyou you can use to it to highlight asection of code and ask it to explainwhere is that useful well if you'rereviewing someone else's code uh eitherfor review purposes or it's actuallycode that you won't need to use thatsomeone in certain cases we've heardfrom developers may not even be part ofthe organization anymoresomething like code explanation can bevery helpfuland unit test generation is duet cancreate a unit test plan for you and ifyou provide the the requisite edge casesit can even implement it for you andwhere this obviously helps is writingunit tests is cumbersome it's timeconsuming but having proper coverage ofyour code is important and you knowdoing that when you have a tightdeadline can sometimes be a lot and doit can help therefinally we already talked about whatgoes on behind the scenes but let's talkabout it just a little bit more so whatis the what happens at various stages asum you know we go from model to duetso what we start with is Google'sfoundational state-of-the-art largelanguage modelswe then take it and find tune it on codeto prove and this is as we've mentionedhigh quality code we have our uh youknow we have ways of as figuring outlike what we deem to be high qualityum open source appropriately licensedcode and then we take that code we stripit of personally identifiableinformation we will do some processingto make the code better suitable for anllm like taking miles tripping HTML tomarkdownand then we will train the llm for theirown code at this stage which is the bluebox you see in there the the largelanguage model is gets better at codingtasks but then we do another layer ontop of that another layer of fine tuningto make sure that the large languagemodel is good for Google Cloud specificcoding tasks so the answers are relevantto gcp specific tasksand again we're using high quality codehigh quality documentationone of the things that we have to thinkabout at this stage is we want to makesure that the model is better at gcp butdoesn't as a result perform poorly onGeneral coding tasks so there's a lot oflike playing between various mixtures ofdata sets to make sure the model is goodat gcp specific tasks is good at Generalcoding tasks and it's good at naturallanguage tasks which are relevant tocodingThe Next Step as part of the gcpspecific tuning is known as instructiontuning the goal of stage is to make surethe model responds in a way the style ofresponse the length of response so thisis no longer about the content at thispoint at this stage it's more about thestyle is specific to what would be bestfor gcp customers and what you use atthis stage is a smaller data set but itis high quality it's hand curated and alot of it is written by Google Cloudexperts so these are all all those stepsthat we take to make sure that whatcomes out of the model is the bestresponse that our customers can havethen of course there is a whole stage ofsome of which we touched on taking themodel response doing post-processingadding the requisite safety guard railsand all of this happens before theresponse shows up in your IDE but now tosee it in action I'm going to hand itover to Marcos for the demoall right so time to show you folks aquick live version ofwhat you're about right solet me just open here my screen so whatI have here is essentially a code versusvs code running inside the Clockworkstations just have the convenience ofthat in the browser but everything I'mshowing here of us can also get on yourlocal IDs right so I think the exampleI'll cover here is essentially this usecase which is pretty interesting aboutduet AI which is I love you to say maybeyou hear about a new API or a newservice a curious to try out Auto Showhere is essentially uh I'll write abasic kubernetes application a guestbookapplication which takes the inputswrites text in English and then add thecapability to translate the text fromEnglish to Spanish by using duet to helpme integrate thethe translation API to my applicationright so let me start so by using bytaking all the cloud code code sampleslet me just go hereCloud code new application there's goingto pick a sample flask guest bookapplicationright so here I havemaybe quick question folks in the andthere can you folks see this font sizeor should I zoom in a bit furthera bit more okaygood okay thanksall right so uh so what I do here is Igot a basic application let's say it'smy first time using Cloud code I don'tknow what this code is about right sookay so before I even starting tounderstand what kind of code I'm lookingat here right so that's where duet AIcode explanation come in handy right soI have this large application here ithas a few methods what I can do here isSelect my codewhat you see here is this yellow lightsboth those are essentially smart actionsthere's actually actions you can performon code have selectedwhat you do here is a click on heyexplain me this codewhat you do is essentially give menatural language high level explanationwhat my code does right so okay so as aflat server use mongodb essentiallygives me the gist kind of gives me thismental map of what this application doesand teach me interesting stuff forexample bleach bleach is an API forsanitizing my user input let's say Ispend some time I read through it sayhey now I actually understand the basicsof this application I know that if Iwant to translate my code or likely tomodify that specific messages uh methodhereright so before modifying let me justquickly deploy that to kubernetes totest the application of this and thenmodify and test the new version with atranslation in place right so usingCloud code I can click on the cloud codemenu I can click here on the cloud codemenurun on kubernetesselect my cluster in the case I have aready to go GK cluster here click on yesselect an image repoand there's a repo hereand let me try to collapse things a bitso what cloud code is doing here isorchestrating all the build deployportfolio step so the heroes don't haveto worry about running a bunch of cubeCTR comments just be taken care by theorchestration capabilities which arebehind Cloud codeI got an application deployed here let'ssay I want to run that I can go to thisdevelopment sessions menu Cloud goodnessand the Berkeley econ port for urlsor to give me is essentially all theports which are being served by myapplication I just want to go to thefront end so I just click on thisclick on follow linkwhat you see here is essentially basicguest book application for running and Ican do here testworkslet me just refresh thisthat's how you folks see it's a livedemo when you get error messagesit's very interestinglet me just redeploy this applicationthe punch my clusterokay finish the pro in the front end thebackhandit's now finishing the deployment it'snow forwarded I can try it again andopen this URLand I'll get best guess book I'll trythisagainand yeah this time it works you see itwas luckily some messed up with thedeployment step but yeah we're reallydeploying we just got here so she gotapplication running here like the Magicsof working with kubernetes and uh allright let's get to duet now so now Ihave an application running no AI sofarming there was some f explanation letme get into actually writing some codehere so I understand my application letme collapse this view hereI got my back dot Pi application I wantto incorporate translation here let meopen a temporary separate file just forbetter visibility for you folks tocreate a method to incorporate thetranslation API right so go hereclick herenew file damp dot piso what I can do with duet is let mecollapse The View here so it's betterfor you folks you see what you can dowith duet is I can describe what I wantto achieve as a comments and use codegeneration generates some functions andsome code for me so in that case I wantto function to translatetext from English to Spanishusing the cloud andCloud translate this keyboard is a bithard type of entrancelate API V2 just describe hereI trigger code Generationsandthere you go essentially what you seehere is duet Let me just zoom out a bitso get the big picture here joetteessentially suggest some code implementthe logic but it's not only generic codeyou have here the library importstatements you have your instantiatingclass because I'm doing all the stepswhich typically you'd have to otherwisego to the documentation and kind of havechildren here's getting you from zero torunning app more quickly before have tomake a call so yes actually want to usethat once you decide to choose an APIthen you can spend the time learn aboutthe methods and intricacies of theapplication right so duet also providesmultiple options so you see here thismenu on the top I can toggle between sayI get four suggestions I can togglebetween them and see which one seems youmake more sense for me the case there'sa more generic one using Target I'lljust use the simpler one which hardcodes the language Spanish the yeahhere's giving us optionality when you'retrying to pick the code for you to use Ipress tab my code was accepted what I dohere is just call computer code back tomy application let me just move thisdebug menu hereI'll just paste it here below my methodthat's one okay so again method here nowI have to install that Library so I haveto modify my requirements.txt filethat's where joette comes in handy aswell so I can just open myrequirements.txt icon of the chatbot seewhere it has let me just clean up thishistory and I can see herehow to modify or justhow to modify myrequirements.txt to incorporate thecloud translationAPIand there you go it tells me hey that'sthe lineage and requirements text itjust saves you a trip back and forth tothe docs you just rely on askingquestions to do it here let's you cansee here we have generation helps forthose big use cases but it can also helpfor those smaller and frequentlyoccurring tasks on your developmentlifecycle so just copy thisbased on my requirements.txt so now Ihave the method added I have therequirements going to be installed viapip I need to integrate that message myapplication right so that's all forexample we have here my appyou have all these lineswith explanation I understood thatI need to modify this route here whichhas messagesand I want to modify this line herelet's ask for duet for help let's say uhlet me just increase the size of this soyou can see better let's say modify myads messagehere modify my ADD message function soit automaticallytranslatesthe sorry this screen size is not trueit automatically modifies theraw data messagetranslates thetheraw datamessageand boom so what I do here is generatesome codes suggesting hey here's how youcan modify your code to incorporate thatfor example it's a simple one here Ijust say hey here are some lines for youto add right so below dot get Json Ineed to add this raw data one here whichis essentially translating uh my textso I do is I copy thisI'll paste this line ohneed to copy this all righttranslating the codeand I'll paste this over here okay sonow I have essentially modify myapplication I have added the transitionAPI now calling the transition API totranslate the raw data message my usersare providing all modified go back toCloud codeI can just go to my debugger panel clickon the reload stepdeployment again of my new applicationand within a few minutes you essentiallyhave the new application running andI'll open the forwarding again and folksyou see the application modify to callthe translation APIforeignit's deployed now I'll just open theport forward URL here let me just openthe size of this I want to open my frontend opening my front end here let's saytesthello worldand I click on postoopsdoes this thing should be workingit's hardokay let me just do one thing here letme just see what's happening here so onething Cloud code does is you canactually open one of your pods totroubleshoot what is happening with itright so in that case I'm going to openmy backhandsee what is happening uh hereall right so it's saying the argumentcannot be ofnon-typeokaylet me just do a quicktweak here translationoh yeah I need to return statement goodpoint yeahoh yes very smart I copied by I forgotyou had a return statement good catch ohdo I trans completes that so yeah sodummy I forgot forgot your copy thereturn statement and now it is writtenyeah so now let's redeploy that so whathappened was I should have I shouldn'thave created a separate file there was aseparate file and I copied everythingbut the return line and of course you'renot returning translated text so there'sno way the code would work this way lessthan redeploy and see it again yeahcool thing was direct actually suggestedreturn statement so it's see so theysurprise them or additional capabilityall right let's do it for each deploytime Targetwaiting for it to be exposed supportforwardness setupforeign[Applause]statement that's the magic of codecomplete she gets so she gets the prefixand the suffix of your cursor andsuggests the most likely completion youwant to get in that context so that'scode generation called completionexplanation I'll quickly show testgeneration because they're a bit shorton time we just want to show you a thingwhich is interesting say Hey you likethis say hey I actually want you todeploy thatbut I really don't want to deploy thatwithout having proper test coverageright to me at least you shouldn't be atleast some basic tests right so let'ssay I'll then go here to my chatbot andI clean this up and I'll say heygenerate some of the increments let'ssay Implement some basic unit testsimplementsome basic unit tests for my codeso here's all the tabs you have openerID are passed under the hood as a promptto duet so it knows this code means it'smy is the actual code I have runninghere I don't have to talk too much aboutmethod the libraries can just use thatnatural language you're talking to thisso yeah so then here essentially getsomebasic uh tests that's nice but I reallywanted to test more about translationstuff so I can say here uh implementmore testsfocused on translationedge casesessentially have this they just havingthis back and forth conversation whereyou canyou can essentially describe the taskyou achievegood sookay so implementyeah it's describing the test that'sused for Implement unit tests folks andtranslation use case did you use Virtualbe able to have a back and forthconversation with the chat Bots and theyshould be able to simplify your uh yourtask of creating tests and increase inyour test uh curvature right so allright folks that's it for the demoand oh now hand it over to Emily to talkabout the experience Wayfair hadincorporating Duets on their developmentworkflows let me justlet me just open the presentation modeherepresent reviewgreat so thank you Marcoscool so I'm here to talk about Wayfairsuccessor using Dua AIso first a little bit about Wayfair assome of you may know Wayfair is ane-commerce platform focused on itemsexclusively for the home if you take alook at my Boston apartment literallyevery single thing is from Wayfair andI'm not exaggerating our technology andinfrastructure brings together suppliersand customers to create a market leadingexperience for both through our supplierServices fulfillment customer serviceand the online shopping experience myrole at Wayfair is in our platformengineering team on engineeringEffectiveness team where we focus ondevelopers autonomy productivity andexperiencecool so wayfair's goal is um or sorryone of our main missions is to increasethe developer acceleration throughgenerative AI wayfair's goal is toprovide Engineers with access to onecode Genai collaborator given that itincreases productivity and developersatisfaction to do this we areevaluating different co-gen AI assistanttools through experimental pilotprogramsso I'm here today to talk about our DuaAI pilot program experimentso we enlisted 28 software engineers andsplit them in half between those whowould code in Python and those coding inJava within the took those two cohortssplit them in half again with a controlgroup and experimental group so theexperimental group had access to Dua AIwhile the control group did notthey were then given a small codingproject to complete similar to atake-home interview question that wewould give out and then once they weredone with that we enlisted six codereviewers to do blind reviews of boththe experimental and control projects sothe code reviewers did not know if theproject that they were reviewing used AIor notall right answer the results so thenumbers on this page reflect how theexperimental group compared to thecontrol group so the first line You'llsee up here is the productivity metricswhich are pretty excitingso we asked the engineers who werecompleting the projects to tell us howlong it took them to set up their codingenvironments and then how long it tookthem to complete the projects as you cansee here those numbers are prettypromising and they were between 13 and55 quicker than the control group usingso using AI increased their productivitywe then had the code reviewers assesscode qualityfor all the reviews so they went throughall the project submissions read throughall the code and umproduce the results we see here so ofthe projects that included unit tests wesaw that there was a 48 increase of unittest coverage for the groups that use doAI so this tells us we're probably morelikely to see higher unit test coveragewith um projects or Engineers using AIthe nature of the project involvedfinding a certain number of results thecontrol group ended up finding 30percent more results than the controlgroupalso due to the nature of the projectsnot all the code submissions wererunnable as is on the code reviewer'slaptop so the experimental group usingDua AI had an 18 higher chance of thecode actually being able to run theyalso had a seven percent increase incode readability compared to the controlgroupnot all of the numbers are in the greenfor Dua AI so we actually sawdifferences between results depending onwhat coding language that theparticipants use so for code quality wesaw a 31 increase if they were usingpython but a 22 decrease for Java whichwas kind of interesting we also saw thatthe eight percent less chance of meetingall the code requirementsI do really want to Zone in on this bigred number at the bottom which you mighthave seen right when I opened this slidenegative 110 percent is a little scarynumber for code execution time so thisis the time it took for the project toactually run and find the resultswhat we found here is it actually is alimitation for our experiment we had avery small sample size for this numberas I mentioned before not all of theprojects were runnable as is so thisleft us with an even smaller subset tothen calculate the code execution timeI'm going to talk a little bit about theJava projects in particular afterlooking in a little bit deeper I foundthat there was actually one Java projectoutlier that significantly impactedthese results so of the runnableprojects we had one from the controlgroup for Java and four from theexperimental group that were able to runsuccessfully out of those five projectsthere was one outlier that actually took24 minutes longer to run than the nextshortest project so if we actuallyremove that outlier we saw that the Javaprojects were actually 30 percent fasterfor the experimental group compared tothe control group so this taught us apretty valuable lesson for our upcomingCogen AI assistant experiments that weneed to get a larger sample size sothese outliers can't significantlyimpact our results like you see herenext I'm going to talk about oursentiment results so once the engineerscompleted their projects they were givena survey and asked to fill out theirfeelings towards using Dua AI and thesenumbers were overwhelmingly positive sothe engineers reported that they were 30percent more productive they felt likethey were able to work and work morequickly and spend less time onboilerplate codethey said they were able to focus onmore satisfying work and that those thatwork took less mental effortthey did report that they felt Less inthe flow and a little bit morefrustrated when coding prior to workingon these projects the experimental groupwas given a quick tutorial on how to usedo I AI but now for real formal trainingso we kind of talked this number up toyou know this is their first time reallyusing the tool didn't have a lot ofexperience a little unfamiliar with itso we predict that as they gain morefamiliarity and are continuing to use Aiand their day-to-day jobs that thosenumbers will increase as wellso we're definitely interested intracking sentiment over timeso after analyzing all of these resultswe recommended that Wayfair enables do IAI for our Engineers given its increasesin developer velocity code readabilityand satisfactionengineers at Wayfair are able toself-select one Cogen AI assistantwe are evaluating multiple options butright now Dua AI is the only one that wehave approved so far so we're reallyexcited to get our Engineers on itwe are monitoring our existing doormetrics to measure dual AI success overtime as more engineers get their handsonto AI we predict that it willpositively impact our door metrics weare also currently working with the DuaAI team to umto add an additional inner loopproductivity metrics so that we cancontinue to evaluate duet ai's Roi so Iwas pretty excited to hear about some ofthe new features coming out for Dua AIover the next year or soMy Hope Is that other companies canfollow our lead by running code gen AIassisted experiments to find the righttools for your developers to increasetheir productivity and satisfaction aswell so thank you and back to you Marcosand thanks[Applause]thanks Emily thanks so much for thecollaboration and offer all the effortsabout measuring developer product hereas you can see it's it's a nuancedeffort but it's nothing it's very worthit it's a good way of essentiallygetting a sense of the bottom lineimpact AI is having your day-to-dayright so folks that's it for todaythanks so much for taking the time andjoining here as you folks saw duet againeasy two you can install your IDs andhelps you increase your productivity aswell as Empower your developers and youcan try it out by going to cloud2go.comEarly Access duet AI another time shortI'll be taking I'll be we'll be outtaking questions because I think we area time here right so thanks everybodyforeign"
