product manager ofgkeall right uh yeah these are the contentsthat we recover but this is all abouthow to build the scalable machinelearning startupyes uh yeah welcome to uh 2023 uh I justsay over machine learning everyone talksabout uh GPT righthow many of you heard about chpthow many of you uh have tried GPT rightyeah everyone right I mean is thereanyone who hasn't tried church it's goodyou should try right[Music]oh yeah okay good yeah a lot of peoplefrom the startup uh how many of youactually uh applied machine learning uhyour day-to-day service and successfullyokay good good glad to hear glad to seethat our team members are reading theirhands rightuh yes everyone talks about like achurch GPT and machine learning but wehope is really challenging to applyemotional learning in your day-to-dayservice in a really impactful way rightso yes I hope the story we are sharingtoday really helps you actually toachieve your goal and yes we are here tohelp you so if you have any questionsyou can talk to our team members I'll behere after our presentations so feelfree to come by but uh while I mean yeseveryone talks about a large languagemodel and conversational and orgenerative AI I mean also the hiddenlike a even bigger part of emotionallearning is applied to the services weare using day to day right can youimagine what's actually the largestscale of a machine Learning Systemtoday it's actually I mean Google searchad engine and also uh the Facebookmatters like a social feed optimizationright it's all driven by Machinelearning and uh this is saying for theYouTube recommendation and Netflixrecommendation Uber or insta card routeoptimization or like a so they are likethe ad programs right so uh I can sharesome of the I mean story among thosecompanies right I personally was atYouTube in 2008 uh to 2010 and yesprobably I mean these are the story I Ireally knows right so uh I I did a quicklike a tax check before actually ontoday's presentations also that I reallykind of share the exact informationright so I typed what was the YouTubeRevenue in 2009 on Google search boxand the first result was this oneeven like it didn't show the revenuenumber the first result of the YouTubeis doomed right and that's exactly howwe failed in 2008 there was a two yearsafter YouTube education YouTube wasoccurred by Google in 2006 right and ifwe fast forward nownow in 2023 they have more than 30billion as Revenue hugely profitable whypeople in 2009 really worried heyYouTube cannot be like sustainable rightand uh yeah I mean it's a test isgrowing at business 16 over Google's adRevenue right so what changed whatchanged from YouTube to like Doom doYouTube in 2009 tofast growthhugely profitable business in 2023so from my perspective there are two keyfactors key Technologies for this oneone is a large scale very effectiveCloud infrastructure right the secondpart is all the best machine learning soI mentioned I joined like two year afterYouTube acquisition I mean some of youactually might remember uh YouTubebefore air condition some of youactually probably hasn't born at thattime right uh YouTubers having site wasalways almost down like every week rightbecause uh at that point building yourown data center uh keeping up thescalability issue was really like a popTech challenges rightwhen you Google bought YouTube in 2006they actually migrate or rewrite prettymuch every YouTube back-end code onGoogle data center step which is aprevious previous generation of GoogleCloud rightso first two years basically make theservice scalable and also reduce theserving costs I mean very effectivelyand I mean this is a basic element whatlike many of the startups in this roomare doing right we are building a uniqueor very effective service on top of thepublic Cloud righteven after that by 2009 YouTube wasstill burning 1 billion to serve all theglobal traffic ad Revenue was only 200million why so when uh when I joinedfirst in 2008 I actually checked like uhthe bigquery uh on on how many data howmany videos we are showing at and I whatI found is that we are only showing adson the home page right and at that pointthere's still like a half a million ofvideos on YouTubedata from those videos and users like abehavior patterns watch patterns it'snot utilized and uh given that we arenot showing the right ads to the rightusers right that's actually uh YouTubersare I mean only monitoring verypartiallyif you're not neutralizing the data fromthis half a million video there's no wayactually you can actually have enoughprofit to serve or entire the costand there's no like a human can killhandicrate right as for half a millionvideos and at that point is actuallywhen I realized hey machine learning isthe key when it launched first machinelearning project we chose feature videoin 2008 uh it really puts you to brandnew Revenue like 50 on the thing thefirst day of the launch and yeah thestory after that we already saw thatright YouTube and hockey stick growththen also first time I really felt howessential and how crucial how powerfulmachine learning is for your businessand your services and there was a timeactually I really felt uh like I got theanswer for like my lifetime Mission sobefore we jump into the detail of Molokolet's actually uh go back in times andyes I probably share some of my personalstories right as many of uh you in thisroom uh II I first uh use computer in the fourthgrade or very early days right and yes Iwas kid at that time I I always feltthank you computer as like a living likea puppy and when I play a game like alike chess on computer trackers there'ssomeone like sitting the behind thescreen and trying to cheat me right uhthat's actually how I was got into themachine learning I really want to seehow I can make the computer smarter anduh that's actually how I begin to studycomputer science and econ because bothare the studies are about the howactually to understand how people thinkright so when I uh I got very toointeresting like a weirdo device from myprofessors in my University this is likean eight nine is oh my gosh I mean I'vebeen doing this for more than 20 yearswhich makes me appear old so first firstadvice I got from my professor when shesaw that uh I was doing like doublemajor in econ and computer science andaction uh if you want to start a companyat some point right you probably shouldtake our management classmore interested in understanding howpeople think another actual device I gotwas I mean some of you might remember AIwinter uh so the deep blue right IBM'sAI machine I complete uh Grandmasterhuman Grand Master in all the daysthere's a huge expectation about AI canchange anything right and then afterthat actually there's a mismatch betweenthe expectation and the the reality oftechnology so that actually a lot ofpeople went through the AI winter with avery skeptical like period on AI and oneof my advisor actually went through theperiod he actually advised me that heyif you study AI or machine learning youwill starve as always you should notlike study machine learning right but Ialso a bit rebellious so I didn't takethe advice but uh but actually thatactually made me to focus on what realimpact actually machine learning can canmake right and a funny enough uh many ofour team members actually went wentthrough the same actually uh periodright so my co-founder DJ we areactually at the same computerArchitecture Lab which is basically veryold I mean the conceptual version of GPUso at that point our Focus was how weactually can solve the computationproblem uh to make the the machinelearning okay really like a work coverand our chief of a machine learningofficer I didn't know that actually heis a PhD Dropout as well like me he alsoleft the PHD program all the actual tworeally work on the industry machinelearning problem to actually make thereal impactso yes uh fast forward ironYouTube I was a part of YouTube TeamCarlos part of the Google research teamhe was Tech lead for the Civil uh whichis one of the largest scale uhparallelized machine learning platformat Google so we actually applied civilon YouTube and yes that was the firsttime actually I saw what machinelearning can really change in the reallifeso after that after YouTubeI moved on to the Android I was FirstData engineer at Android team I mean Iwas so excited about the Android this islike a data generated device right Imean all the days in on desktop youprobably search you booking travelsright but but uh people's activity thetype of the data we are generating fromthis handle device is I mean massive wedo the right sharing uh we do fooddelivery right another unique part is wetalked about like YouTube we talkedabout uh Uber doordash how they areutilizing machine learning for theirlike business optimizations right butwith the mobile and also public CloudRevolution like a Google Cloud rightwhat we are seeing uh what I've seenfrom Android team is there's a veryunique startup for each vertical eachspecific usage on each country yes wehave an Uber for Rider sharing we have adoordash for food delivery here but ifyou go to South Asia there's a graphactually in fact the gravity kicked outUber from Southeast Asia right and if wehave this year there is a delivery heroand we work into several of thesecompanies globally right so each uniquelocation and each unique verticalthere's a basically unicorn company inall of these countries and this companyprovides very unique value to the usersalso have a very unique data uh for ontheir particleall of this company didn't suffer withwhat YouTube struggled in in thebeginning because thanks to the publicCloud including Google Cloud right sothey they didn't have any scalabilityissue where actually they are stillstruggling the 10 next challenge theyhave is that they're generating a lotmore like a massive scale over data nowactually they have a similar problem towhat YouTube had in 2008 now it's timeto find the real value out from the datato have a sustainable profitable hypergrowth business still the machinelearning is key for the problem and notmany companies with the technology sothat's kind of when I first talk aboutthis is a big problemuh also what I can contribute a lot wecan create real value through themachine learning that's like when Idecide to leave Googleand decide to start a machine LearningCompanyso this is the title of this page isactually not from me it's from one ofour co-founder DJ DJ was technicallythat Google Cloud at that time uh veryobjective I mean some of you actuallysmiling uh that was a conservative soyeah he was joining uh my uh my journeywe set up yeah I knew I know 90s right Ireally appreciate that he still joinedwithout either 10 uh chance uh and oneof our team the only team members alsomentioned that hey I really felt likethis is a clip jumping but three daysafter he said oh but I realized this isa bungee jumping they're asking why doyou think it's a bunch of jumpingactually II thought I would never have like aoffice launch but we have uh the foodcatering startup services like a fullcover right and we actually reallyworried hey what kind of infrastructurewe can we can use outside of Google uhthe data center right but we realizedthere's a huge public Cloud uh toolkitswe can use I mean we definitely didn'tfeel any difference when uh we areprogramming within the big company'sumbrella and then outside thanks to thepublic cloudasked here we went through a lot of ourstartup like up and downside rollercoaster ride uh some of you yes here uhwho is doing start early stage startup Itotally recognize how you are feelingnow so feel free to come by I canprobably share some of the emotionalsupport uh so one of one of our uhinteresting moment of a memorable momentof our company so we're in the middle ofa city to be around uh definitely we hada very short Runway which means actuallywe are about to think bankrupt and uh weare basically comparing between Onefunds fund uh fundraising Pharmacy andactually one of a kitchen Township fromone of our major social networks hereand uh yeah I was uh I mean it's likeactually helping they're like amonetization basically the same thingright neutralizing their data for theirprofitable growth we we've seen howsuccessful it can be and how impactfuland financially uh I mean lucrative itcan be home YouTube examples Facebookexample one of our team members Simoncame to me and and told him we've donethis once for YouTube right and I'vedone most followed on LinkedIn right weknow how impacted it can be but we havea chance to actually have 50 differentcustomersright why should we just joinanother company and repeat what you didso I I okay so that's kind of when Ifelt like wow yeah we can actually buildup the infrastructure for everyone andyes we uh recruitwithin disappointed jumping startupecosystem right we we expedited ourgrowth using a lot of service frompayroll using customand accounting services most importantlywe grew our we built our service ontothe public Cloud right and this issomething great actual chance we cancontribute back to the startup Communitywe can so we can build very like apurposeful operational machine LearningSystem and giving back to the otherstartup company so that they canactually solve their machine learningneeds using our system so that's kind ofhow we grew the ideauh and yes we invest heavily on R D sofirst five years uh we really focus onthe building scalable Planet scale uhgeneric machine learning engine which wewill actually share the more detailslater and once actually we launched ourfirst deep learning model in 2018 webegin to have a hockey stick growthright for the last 10 happens we grewmore than 5x we are profitable for thelast uh three years and yes we wementioned about helping 50 customers wehave more than thousand customers wehave more than 50 000 advertisers on ourplatform from this thousand customersand then this is basically the whenmachine Learning Works you will havethis hockey stick growth right I meanyes this is the correct from ourtrajectory we've seen the same thing onfrom YouTube right if you see the Googlesearch Revenue chart Facebook chargesdefinitely find a very similar patternand this is also the pattern we arecreating for our customers okay I meanif you start off with a machine learningneeds and we are happy to share ourknowledge is that we're happy to haveyou to have the growth from the machinelearninguh yes and from there uh yes we begin toalso have a uh industry recognition fromInc and yes a few days ago we are pickedas a customer of the year of a Googleclass which actually we are really[Applause]and yeah okay like happy to share ouranalysisyes so what what we appeared for thefirst five years what were we appearedright first first we built plan scaleinfrastructure whenwe are talking about machine learningpeople often think oh this is from likeone algorithm right but uh we aretalking about operational machinelearning right so how actually Googlecreate like a 200 billion as well howYouTube create like Authority businessads Revenue so if you have accountactually if you divide Google's revenuefrom their search query they're makinglike less than like a one dollar perquery but but they are doing like aplanet scale right so in our in our casewe are serving more than 600 billion atthe requests per day uh with the Deeplearning uh within like 14 millisecondsright if you did like a it is 40 minutesshorter than like your eye blinkingright so uh how big is 60 100 billion uhAndrew cast I mean we how many people wehave like eight billion uh population uhwe have in globally right so this ismore like a 70 more than 70 AD requestsor if you think this is a messengerservice right it's actually the plan ishere Messenger Service so we are we arerunning uh Planet scale machine LearningSystem uh actually to cover Globaltraffic so with that uh we actually canserve the largest scale uh socialnetworks uh or e-commerce company fooddelivery company we actually are headedwe launched one project with the largestsmartphone company in the world and atthat point with the additional trafficwe add is less than like a 10 over ourentire Global traffic so yes this isbasically Foundation repeat to help allthe Enterprise and startup companiesand yes uh this maybe I mean a bit uhthe the secret kind of the confidentialinformation but I mean again like we'rehappy to share our analysis informationuh for our startup communities right sothis is a very high level block diagramuh over our system uh again like this isoperational motion learning this systemwe are running this system interestingcontinuously for every second uh webuild our serving the infrastructureusing Google Cloud uh the engine and acomputer engine and then the green boxhere is our data infrastructure rightwell we use data flow to collect theanalyze log and put it back to the ourlocal repositories and the feature storesorting system like a big table and thenyes we use the Google Cloud Storage tostore long-term log and then mostimportantly yes we use tensorflow ourdeep learning engine on top oftensorflow we are also exploring a TPUthe special realized hardware for theacceleration but this is basically thehigh level of diagram of what we builtfor the first five years and using thatinfrastructure the engine actually webuilt is our as I mentioned our corepurpose is building very uh genericengine which can cover differentverticals different locations and verydifferent types of data right sowe I mean very simply saying we havekind of like three different types ofdata like user data which is I mean yourinterest your uh past browse patterndata and then uh we also use acontextual data feature where you are atnow what kind of page you are watchingwhat's in in the page uh context andthen campaign data the match is betweenthe your campaign and the user contextis very important right these are typesof the uh the big kind of the categoriesof data we are handling but uh orAdvanced machine learning based on thetensorflow and the Deep learning shouldenables enables us to handle varioustypes overview data right so user datawhen you are using food delivery orcompared to the when you are usingwriter sharing it can be very differentright but given the the powerful themachine learning Advanced machinelearning actually enables you to handleall these different types of data thisis how we can have all different typesof the startup and Enterprise companyusing our machine learninginfrastructureand yes most important part is uhbuilding at your scalable machinelearning uh team and the infrastructurewe talked a lot about the infrastructurebut if you actually today's conversationI had a the minister right we actuallyboth agree thatyou start not just sort of one singlealgorithm right building the great teamculture and building parallelizedbasically building a human like PhDparallelism right so that we can exploreexplore many many different like machinelearning models and having continuedInnovation that's the key part right souh we we've been built that very strongengineering team still more than half ofour team members on r d uh and among thehalf of our team members yes okay 25more than 25 of team members on the datascience and machine learning so uh anysingle day we are running more than 460different machine learning models we areusing more than 200 million examples forthe single prediction so this is thedefinitely I mean the largest scalemachine Learning System to like any anyother comparable companiesand yes uh with these are The quicksummary over what we built for the firstfive years and yes after we launched itwe scaled quickly we use gke frominstant provocation more details aboutgke but uh just a quick quick summary weactually ran four different data centerseven from like when we were 20 peopleteam right so we cover the globaltraffic only with the 20 people too andthis is I mean nothing new right whenInstagram was occurred by Facebook therewas only 17 people when WhatsApp JP theglobal chat service with authoritypeople right now actually the publiccloud and the containers and kubernetesengine you can build Global Services andmany of our clients also I meanrepeating the same thing right with avery handful of engineer so thatactually I will leave it to be instantto cover laterCloud DSP is uh growing fast it becamethe largest independent uh machinelearning driven ad platform outside oftheGoogle and meta now actually uh welaunched second new machine learningInnovation uh two years ago more retailmedia platform which is basicallyhelping e-commerce company to buildtheir own profitable Revenue stream fromadvertising program uh some of youactually might heard that Amazon isowning like a 40 billion from uh at thebusiness a lot of I mean e-commercecompanies Marketplace company who grewfast for the last uh the five yearsright now actually they need to reallythink deep about how they can build asustainable business last product and avery exciting product we launched thisyear is our ad monetization forstreaming and Ott Services you alsoprobably heard that Netflix is enteringlaunching the ad program right a lot ofOtt programs or Services through fastduring pandemic but now actually theyare really thinking how they canactually continuously uh invest on thecontents while abusing profitablebusiness this kind of Technology will bevery essential for these startupsespecially within this room to have asustainable fast growth and the onecommon thing of all of these three newproducts is actually it's all powered byMachine learning so machine learning notonly enables our hyper growth on thefirst product but machine learning isalso enabling us to launch newInnovations continuously and so what weare very excited about and yes this is aour 10th anniversary over over morelocal definitely I grew up thank youso yesuh lifetime question is how I can makethe real impact using machine learningand I'm so glad that uhwe are deliver creating real value forour customers and startup ecosystem andyes interestingly I'm in 2003 2023everyone talks about machine learningright but still I think we only like aon that one percent of true potentialover machine learning yes is thetechnology technology is real right butof building the really like sustainablelong-lasting the business all from thetechnology right we I mean we are farFrontier over there but I wouldn't saywe found the final solution we arecontinuously working with our client weare brainstorming with our clientdefinitely exploding uh heavily with thedifferent like models so yes we're happyto have you have your project machinelearning project we're happy tobrainstorm video but that actuallyexcites me and yes I'm looking forwardto the next 10 years right thank you[Applause]thank you Jim for sharing yours andmalacca's incredible storyit didn't already touched upon a lot ofthis already but I wanted to highlightthree of the core benefits GK will giveto startups who are building and usingAIthe timer never started so I'll needhelp knowing what we're at timewellsorryso the three benefits the first oneperformance and scalability two costefficiency and three flexibilityscalability you knowokay we'll start with you when you'resmall scale with you to thousands ofnodes just like we did with Marco rightwe'll be with you for each step of theway in your growth journey andespecially for AIyou need to be able to optimize to yourperformance and you know get todistributed orchestrated AI acceleratorsas you build the larger models anddelivery applications to customersper scalability GK has unmatched supportfor the largest clusters no other Cloudadvertises the same scale that we canachieveand as I mentioned accelerators GK isyour easiest way to access all thelatest and greatest accelerators bothNvidia gpus and tpus so whether you'redoing data processing training finetuning or inference we have the rightaccelerator to meet your performanceneedsnumber two cost efficiency I mean let'sbe real especially for startups moneycan be tight you have to be efficientwith your resources GK will scale upwhen you need that demand but scale backdown to make sure that you don't haveidle Resources pay for only what youneed when you need itany idle resources that's ultimatelywasted cost and then as your resourcesgrow and as your workloads grow we'llgive you all the tools so you can getthe observability and Hyper optimizetowards your cost budgets and balancethat with the performance that you neednow one of the ways that we do this isthat we help you share gpus we hear fromcustomers all the time that they seetheir gpus are being underutilized andthey are a very expensive resource andso you don't want them to beunderutilized What GPU sharing helps youdo is get full utilization out of thegpus increase your workload throughputand make sure that there's nothing idleso what you can do is you have multipleworkloads targeting a single GPU solet's say you originally had 20utilization well then you can put fiveworkloads onto that GPU and reach 100there's three main ways that we allowyou to do that it's multi-instance gpusmulti-process service or MPS and timesharingmulti-instance gpus is a hardware way topartition the a100s and h100sMPS is a software way to partition anyof the Nvidia gpus and GPU time sharingis time contact shifting now there'sgoing to be trade-offs depending onwhich method to use but ultimately we'retrying to give you all the optionalitysuch as you can make sure to right sizethose workloadsand lastly flexibilitystartups need flexibility to customizeto try new things and ultimately toinnovate you might need portabilityacross multiple platforms or to meetyour customers where they are and yourdevelopers want to choose theirframework of choice such that they canmaintain maximum velocity kubernetesit's a vibrant ecosystem of very matureOSSand that gives your developers your datascientists your machine learningresearchers access to any of the toolsthat they need rather than prescribingthem to one bespoke way right as astartup you move fast if June talkedabout this earlier so you have toexperiment on many different models youneed to try many new things and youdon't want to let your technology stacklimit youand so GK is your unified platform forthat whether you're serving multipleteams or you have multiple workloadsboth Ai and non-aiyou can take any of the different OSStools and put them on the singleabstraction of your orchestration whichis gke right instead of trying to racewith the pace of OSS kubernetes actuallyevolves and grows with OSSand so you'll never be limited by thetype of tool or your workload you canalways choose your best framework foryour job at handum here are a few of the OSS tools Ijust want to highlight within ourecosystem so first one cue this is akubernetes native framework for queuingjobs this is when Google directly investin and it has really tight Integrationswith gke Jax is Google's python libraryfor distributed compute it is actuallythe library that we use for all of ourlargest models and we made thisobviously it's OSS but we also build ittightly into Google cloud and gke soit's really easy for you to use to buildyour largest modelsRay so this one is a unified frameworkto simplify distributed compute this isbecoming very popular with a lot of ourcustomers and so we've launched solutiontemplates to make it easy for you to getstarted and we're continuing to buildthat directly into the GK experienceand then Nvidia obviously being a leaderin accelerators with the gpus they havemany different software applicationsthat are hyper optimized for their gpusand we partner directly with them tobring things like Triton which is ainference server or the Nvidia Nemoframework which is end to end for Gen AImodels directly into gke and lastlyJupiter andnotebooks it's kind of the gateway todata science and machine learning and noAI platform is going to be completewithout strong Jupiter supportum so yeahyou should visit our startup Lounge onthe lower level we have a program tohelp you and you can getnotes it says up to 12 000 but here itsays up to 350 000 and I think Molokomentioned that they were successful witha hundred thousand so we have a lot ofmoney to support you startups you canget expert advice customer successdirectly for you exclusive eventshelping out startups if you're notalready part of the program I verystrongly encourage you to go to Startuplounge and find out how they can helpyou I'll pause if anyone needs to getthe QR codeand then lastly your feedback is superimportant it helps us make sure thatlater sessions next year's sessions arethe ones that you're getting value onand your feedback will help us improvein you know future sessionsso with that I invited Tim back up and Iopened the floor to q a[Applause]anyoneClayton you want to throw a hardquestion at usokayso uh I guess the question is and thisis uh to the local CEO what what isimportant for people thinking aboutgrowing mL of their own uh as they'restarting out like what are the mostimportant lessons that you tookum when you're building your own modelswhen you're building your own uhplatforms for ML what are some of thethings you'd recommenduh I think having this uh the theoperational machine learning concept isprobably the most important part rightuh I mean in the past a lot of peopleapproach to machine learning as just aone-off like a fancy analysis right butbut it is notif you see it again like our examples orlike let's say YouTube or Netflixrecommendation examples right uh I meanyou probably need to start from a bitlike a product like service like amindset with also like a second partylike a data mindset right so basicallyit's uh continue the training andcontinue the Improvement right from thefeedback data I mean the data you'regenerating from your service and usingit as a training and Service uh thetraining and the Improvement data andthen from from there basically you runthe tensorflow and then and theprediction really make your servicebetter right so a lot of companiesfailed to build this kind of a closelike feedback loop and uh yes from fromfrom that perspective this is also whynot only is just a tensorflow or Jupiternotebook right you also need a verystrong like a data pipeline also verystrong uh the operational knowledge howto run this system right so this isactually why sometimes uh you you have avery deep knowledge on your domain orsometimes building or this entireoperation machine learning closed loopcan be very I mean time consuming andalso it can be very challenging this iswhy when we actually want to help yourcompany to shorten the time to Market byproviding a lot of the operationalmachines running side as a serviceany other questions don't be shywell if you prefer one-on-one you canfind us on the floor check out thestartup lounge and feel free to come andreach out[Applause]foreign"
