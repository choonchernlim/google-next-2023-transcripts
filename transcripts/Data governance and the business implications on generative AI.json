every day thank you so muchfor being herehow many of you are really interested ingenerative AIthere we go thank you thank you so muchhow many of you are doing AI todaygreat how many of you are machinelearning experts oh quite a few in theroom isn't it great we get to talk aboutthe work we do in machine learning nowyeah thank you like the thumbs uphi my name is Caroline and I'm themanaging director of our Global AIbusiness here at Google workingalongside Lisa O'Malley who's also inengineering Lisa is going to introduceyourself Lisa O'Malley I'm the seniordirector of product management and ourCloud AI group I look after our searchproducts as well as our industrySolutionsmy partner in crime yesVP ofAI solution architecture so I lead oursolution architect and black belt steamglobally thank you and my very specialguest Xiao please introduce yourselfsure hi hi everyone I'm SAU xiong I'mfrom Singapore I'm part of thegovernment technology agency ofSingapore gov type for sureand so we're talking about datagovernance and the business impactedgenerative AI but of course what betterthan someone who's actually been dealingwith a lot of the regulations andeverything around data and dataefficiencies than someone from theSingapore government for those of youwho don't know I would like Samsung totalk about we have a you have the AITrailblazers program that we'vepartnered with you on tell us a bit youknow tell the audience a bit about theAI Trailblazers program and why it's sosignificant for you yeah soum a couple of months ago we did thisprogram called the AI Trailblazerstogether with Google so a few of thegovernment agencies in Singapore worktogether with Google to come up withthis program and this program has twotracks so one track is to helpgovernment agencies to learn on Ball anddo projects on AI and the other wasactually for the private sector forcompanies who are interested to get onboard the same program as well the ideais and within three months we want toget 100 use cases from both private andpublic sectors and drive those use casestowards a prototype and launch those asproducts so so I think it's been apretty exciting program we really onlybid in it for about slightly more than amonth and it has been it been prettygood in terms of take up we have 50 odduse cases alreadyongoing we run workshops we doeducational kind of boot camps forDevelopers for uh public officers aswell as people from the private sectorand we help them get their use casestogether and drive it in terms ofgetting the uh the necessaryinfrastructure the necessary uhapprovals and so on and so forth andeventually we hope to launch theseprojects within the next few monthsthat's fantastic so can you tell us whydid you choose to collaborate with us tohelp you with that yeah of course I meanI'm in a Google conference rightum but to to be realistic about itactually I think Google is uh one of ourbest Partners uh in Singapore because uhthey have the strength in uh thetechnology of course the engineering andthey have the the capability to deploythe infrastructure that we needed and uhof course there is a lot of very willingand enthusiastic and passionate peoplewithin the team helping to drive thisprogram because it's uh it's not easybecause a lot of these things are new toeveryone including ourselves and thereare a lot of things that we're justtrying for the first time so we needpeople who are willing to try and not beafraid to fail and not be afraid to saypivot when it's necessary so I thinkGoogle is the best partner for thatthing because they're very willing totry and explore together with us werethere any were there any things specificto maybe I what data governanceframework or like the security andprivacy tools we had that also helpedwith some of the decision making ofcourse of course as part of theengineering when I talk aboutengineering it covers the Spectrum it'sjust not about the technology load it'sabout the governance the security andprivacy and all those tools that help usto drive this program forward andhopefully when we roll it out inproduction this will also help us to bea lot more robust and a lot moreproduction capable thank you for that umand and you know to highlight also youknow what social was talking about Lisahe mentioned the thing about partnershipI have with me I have a Google HSBCpartnership also because of you know wealso announced with the anti-moneylaundering solution So Lisa tell us alittle bit about how these types ofPartnerships are helping your teams alsodevelop products and solutions for youknow industry verticals yeah so let metake a step back a bit first and say youknow data governance can be a verynarrow topic or it can be a very broadtopicum narrowly you know Google cloud has acommitment that your data remains yourdata it stays in your tenant it's notused to train any models it's not usedto inform any business around Google andbut it's also a much broader topic andwe think about it in terms of datagovernance data privacy data securityand compliance and these topics arefront and center for most organizationsbut nowhere more so than in financialservices which is a very highlyregulated industry obviously and weworked in partnership with HSBC todevelop a product we call our anti-moneylaundering productand this was you know groundbreaking interms of the money laundering spacebut it meant that it was a new paradigmfor The Regulators for the internalAuditors to understand and so they'revery used to understanding rules-basedsystems you know what the rule does youcan explain it and then you can moveforward when you think about AI it's notquite as simple as that and so we workedto understand we worked with them tounderstand their own internal Frameworksin terms of the Auditors and governancegroups that they need to get approvalfrom internally we put together modelarchitectures methodologies we workedwith them on explainability and how doyou explain what the model has done howdo you think about the outcomes of themodel and how do they workand then we we went with them to theirinternal groups to help explain theprocess and likewise we also worked withThe Regulators that they work with tounderstand what they were looking forand so this helped us build build abetter product and it helped us bring itto Market successfully with HSBC as ourfirst customeranother example that again a regulatedindustry is Healthcareand one of the biggest problems inhealthcare is simply just data wranglingthere are many many disparate systemsthere are many many versions ofstandards that are used and so one ofthe first things we had to do before youcould do any machine learning or AI isactually get the data into the cloudharmonized and normalized and so inorder to do that we worked with manypartners key partners for our Healthcaredata engine and our Healthcare apismaking sure that they were HIPAAcompliant and so as we got the data inthen we looked at okay what do ourcustomers want to do with it they wantto do analytics use cases they want todo machine learning use cases and so weexpanded our HIPAA compliance across allof our vertex AI Suite in order to makesure that we were both us and ourcustomers were covered from a dataprivacy data security and governanceperspective these Partnerships that wehave with customers as we developproducts are really critical and we canyou know build a product in isolationand that's not going to be useful to anyof you when we build with customers andwe understand the use cases that they'retrying to light up it helps us not justpush forward the technology but pushforward the ecosystem and framework ofgovernance security compliance that weneed to have around our products thankyou so much for that Lisa and hamaduyour your teams you know even in yourprevious role when you were building youknow the solution engineering functionyou worked really closely with Lisa andthe product teams for example the alphafold work that was done the deepmindlaunch but your teams were the ones whoactually built the solution can you talkabout how that has also helped with alsocustomer adoption and and you knowworking Partnerships with customers likesocial to get feedback yeah absolutelyso one of the things we do iscollaborate very closely with ourresearch organization and that you knowthey they publish these papers but youneed to take those that research andreal operationalize it so Alpha 4 is abreakthrough Innovation into proteinfolding that really help Advance uh youknow medical research and what my teamdid for example worked with engineeringtook that that research paper and reallydeveloped operationalize it and helpcustomers how can you deploy that modelon on our infrastructure how can youload your data how can you do uh AI ontop of your information so those are thetype of solutions accelerations we buildwhen it comes to research and helping uhyou know just our customersoperationalize some of the researchersand so now that you're also doing theGen you know gen Ai and the generativeAI solution engineering team are youfinding that we're having to have thisgood strong foundational and structurealready with not just the datagovernance but the solutions and thenonly add the generative like you knowlayer on top absolutely so the numberone question I get from customers isabout data and IP protection I think youknow everyone now understands thepotential how this technology isdisruptive how it can help with theminnovate Drive transformation but it'sreally about how do I protect my IP whatabout security how do I make sure Idon't get embarrassed with my I don'tembarrass my brandEtc extra so and Lisa touch on it reallywe have these four pillars right is itprivacy and governance we have securitythe distributed platform everything wedo in our Hardware to make sure weprovide a secure infrastructure also theresponsibility from an AI perspectivehow do we train our model what type ofinformation and what all the controls wego through before we deploy a model butwhen my team work with customers thenumber one thing we do first is helpthem understand what is a referencearchitecture with Gen Ai and really ithelps them be comfortable with how doesexplain how the model works the Googlepart 2 model is Frozen What Happenswithin their own private tenant whenthey do training when they do you knowcustomization what where does thatinformation live how it is protected howit's encrypted it's actually importantnumber one to really Define thatreference architecture on top of theirfoundational Cloud if they are regulatedindustry or if they use PCI Data orextra how do we help them deploy theright blueprint and then explain thegenerative AI layer on top of it helpsthem feel comfortable then we moveforward from augmentation perspectiveyeah and so socialwith you you have you have a mix of theprivate sector because you're alsoenabling services for you know all thedifferent programs startups and thingsin Singapore and you also have you knowyour constituents your citizens and allof that data right can you talk a bitabout how you've been able to separatethe two so that you can still driveInnovation while still being responsibleyeah as as of nowum I think a lot of the use cases arestill being worked out and um and andbesides the uh AI Trailblazer that we'reworking with Google we also have many ofthe agencies now starting up their ownlittle projects little programs andinternally within Golf Tech we are alsobuilding a lot of tools and capabilitiesand also products that we want to launchuh both for our agencies as also for thecitizens so so there are a lot of thingsthat are that are going on in terms ofthe governance and and so on there isactually a very fine thin line to towalk because uh at one hand we we do notwant to discourage Innovation we want toproliferate but on the other handthere's always the the fear ofhallucination right you do not want thegovernment to start screwing nonsense uhor even giving the wrong advice andsomething happensum and and so on and so forth so we needto walk the Thin Line quite a bit onthat but at the same time there aredifferent levels of data in fact we havetwo dimensions of the data which one oneis more related to the security of thedata all the way from open data to tosecret data and then we have thesensitivity of the data where you knoware they more sensitive or lesssensitive of more concerned or not so weneed to also work along these twoDimensions to make sure that uh whateversystems we build and whatever data webuilt uh they are placed in the correctinfrastructure they also place at thecorrect uh positioning where we targetour end users whether they are going tobe internal uh people or are they goingto be agencies or they are going to becitizens so that there's a lot offiguring out as of today because it'sall new to to a lot of us and as well asthe the IP related stuff the good thingabout it is this is not something newfor us we have been doing this for a fewyears now in fact Golf Tech was set upprecisely we realized that the world ischanging we can't do what we used to dowhich is really literally to justprocure our software get outsourcedPartners to to customize it and then weroll it out so we need to take all moreownership and more development of theproducts that we want to roll out forboth ourselves and for our citizens andtherefore we have been building up a lotof these tools so for exampleum we have set up our government dataarchitecture that is rolling out for thewhole of government we have tools likefor privacy toolkit and that's gonna bereally useful because as we try to takein dataum there's a lot of concern about thepii data and therefore how do we how dowe anonymize this data and in the pastwe have actually built a privacy toolkitto help us to anonymize these tools andwe have been progressively rolling outthese two so these two now has becomevery useful in our efforts to dynamizeData before they are used for trading oruseful analysis or use for whichever usecase we have so then now we have a lotof various building blocks that we canuse to enable our use cases and that hasbeen really helpful in pushing our casesforwardthat that's actually really good to hearyou know so you have the keywords andbuilding blocks doing Small Thingsexperimentation but still having the thecore fundamentals of your datagovernance and all of those pieces inthere have you seenum and obviously with regenerative AIespecially over the last sort of sixseven months are you finding theprojects where you had had generative AIyou're seeing some impact like you knowwhether it's a metric or you know abusiness outcome how would youcharacterize that for you I I think theyare still in Early Times still very muchin Early Timesum so definitely measuring the prewhatever whatever kind of goals that wehave measuring and being able to havemetrics to measure are we really gettingthe kind of value of the the projectsand the products that we roll out uh inmany cases they are productivity drivenlikeum for example government we we actuallygive out a lot of Grants to to citizensand to businesses in order to drive theeconomy and so on so forth and when thebusinesses especially the small mediumand Enterprises uh they they they claimfor their grants we have we have peopleprocessing it uh they will take thereceipts they will take the paperworkand try to process it so it's a lot oflaborious work and we have been workingon cases to improve their productivitybyum being able to take in documents fromall kinds of documents or various typesof formats and be able to process itusing AI so so that's actually one ofthe use cases where it's been driving uhproductivity buthaving done that we also want to takethis and make it a a common product suchthat it does not only process claimsfrom uh grants processing and there areactually a lot of different types ofgrants that we are giving up to the tothe uh population to the businesses andso on uh for research purposes and so onso we are also driving it for otherkinds of claims like for exampleinternally in the public servicea lot of people when they go uh whenthey buy stuff and do procurement andthings like that they make claims aswell so these claims a lot of it hasreceipts so we also taking the receiptstoum to sort of like process it through AIto do audit uh analysis to to preventfraud and so on and so forth so sothere's one big group of of use casesthat's driven towards um how do we makethingsor make people more productive orreducing the laborious work and puttinga human labor to where they are moreeffective so I really like that youhighlighted that it seems like youstarted with what the outcome of thejourney is supposed to be and what theexperience is supposed to be and thenput in all of the tools and Technologiesand processes behind that to actuallysupport that I think it's very similaralso to what you know Lisa you had saidwith how your engineering team works andhow do how are you thinking aboutreference architectures now if we haveto think through like what would be theone piece of advice you would have forfor everyone who's looking at doingthings regenerative AI today like we'veheard really good themes here but youknow and this is open to all three ofyou which whoever wants to go first Ican go firstum I I think to me it's making sure thatyou're thinking about a holistic datagovernance strategy you know we tend tobe reactive in terms of oh we needsecurity here oh we need access controlshere oh what's happening with my datawhere did it come fromum and I think if you just step back atthe start of the journey for Gen Ai andmake sure that you're thinking acrossall the pillars that you know hamadu andI talked about data governanceprivacy securitycompliance responsible use of AI I don'tthink for Gen AI we know all the answersI don't think any of you will know allthe answers I think will work towardsthe answers and as long as you havethose pillars in place and people arethinking about those pillars then you'resetting yourselves up to be as asmeasured and as careful as you can be inorder to drive the you know Innovativeand um and really exciting outcomes thatI think we're all we're all thrilled tobe a part ofhow am I doing yeah no it's a greatpoint to build on top of that so I Iadvise uh you know many customers and inaddition to that it's really how can youevolve your internal processes yourinternal controls your audit controls toreally look after AI after datagovernance of AI within yourorganization so I have some customers Ihave a meeting with then we were likediscussing around you know the risk ofAI for the organization the risk to thebrand and they really decided you knowwhat our own internal audit will nowhave ai component right how do we wedon't want to store Innovation we don'twant to prevent Innovation but we'regoing to put a really very streamlinedprocesses so that project AI project cancome to the committee talk about thetype of information they need make surewe run them through our various controlsand before we we let them go and andcontinue implementation so there aredifferent best practices on thetechnology side how do you go throughall those four components but internallyalso you need to update your internalprocesses and controls to make sure thatyou are you're not introducing risk tothe organization yeah and so for youassumption like you know like you aredoing both Enterprise and go you knowgovernment technology Services right andso what is the one piece of advice youwould give to either a private or publicsector or people who are interested inin yeah yeah I think for Gene AI um weall know there's a lot of hype right nowright it is it's really at uh everyoneis at the top of that hard cycle ormaybe inching towards the topum but definitely there's a lot of Buzzaround it I mean uh just in thisconference alone right Google Cloud nextbut we are just talking about AI so so Ithink there's a lot of hype by the endof the day you know the technology thatwe deploy we're always talking about thevalue it brings soum we need to do but of course when youstart a project we have a use case youalways have an understanding of what itdoes and you always have an inkling ofthe value that we will bring but all ofthese things you actually to measure ityou need to have metrics to problemLeague say this is the value that it'sgoing to bring we want to measure itthis way and therefore we want to totest the use case if the use case do notmeet the the measure then I think we wejust need to be brave enough to stopdoing it or pivot to do somethingbecause otherwise you're just going toinvest and do a lot of stuff and it'sactually detrimental in the overallgoals that you want because as you drivethe uh the Gen AI use cases you might beso absorbed and engrossed in that youyou don't think that you still keepdoing it despite it not providing valueand you are just going to to destroyeverything that you do because at theend of the day you'll be still measureduh by the value that you bringum and if it fails gen AI will be blamedright and say look AI is no good andtherefore let's not do AI anymore rightit would not be the case where you knowactually it's just this project and it'snot everything else so I think my advicewould be uh be careful about what you doand measure it all the time uh to seethe successor you bring and be uh braveenough to Pivot when it is not meetingthe targets I like that you mentionedthe thing about about being brave Ithink this is the same for us even inengineering right Lisa yeah you know howthe teams are testing and yep you needto be brave and you need to be willingto pull the plug when it doesn't workBrave and starting and brave andstuffing and blameless right blamelessas well um so the the I think foreveryone it's really difficult to thinkabout how you get started righteverybody is telling you what are youdoing with AI you know bosses who nevercared about AI all of a sudden arecoming out of the woodwork so what arewe doing with AI what do we do we doanything with machine learning we'vebeen doing machine learning for a longtime boss yes no problem but but okaywhat about generative Ai and so for me Iactually see an Amadou and I've beenhaving a lot of conversations with a lotof boards and sea level I feel likegenerative AI is just the the unifier ofall of this work that we've all beendoing and an easy way to now query allof these complex models to give youanswers in just plain language right andso we're all we're all definitely seeingthat so I I wonder you know what you'llthink of this um our president on ourads side he whenever he meets withcustomers he likes to say think about AIfor growth think about AI forefficiencies and then think about AI forthe future and I like that the waythat's framed you know very much to yourpoint how do we innovate how do we stillbuild but then how do you pivot and whendo you know how to Pivot and so forthose of you who are being told like weneed to know what you're doing with AI Ithink those are great Frameworks I meanLisa what do you what do you think ofthat you know the growth efficienciesand yeah I mean this is very alignedwith what we hear from our customers andwhat we talk to our customers about uhthey're you know different businessesare in different Cycles some are tryingto drive top learning growth some aretrying to control costsum but everybody's trying to build forthe future and make sure that their uhthey're cannibalizing themselves beforesomebody else does and so I think theframework makes a lot of sense muhammaduyou've seen a lot of these yeah noabsolutely and and again I think withgenerative AI really and Lisa and teamengineering is doing a finance fantasticjob the barrier for entry has been lowright before and that's really whatgenerative AI brought is that you knowwe love our phds and you know supertechnical ml Engineers but the platformnow if you look at the vertex AIplatform these managed Services we havehave really lowered the barrier to endfor entry and you know unable Innovationall the way from the engineer to thebusiness analyst to the find to the userand you know you can innovate you candrive efficiency but for example all theboards room and CEO I've talked tothey're really worried about beingdisrupted with AI not getting on boardand having a strategy defines a datastrategy the AI strategy the generativeAI strategy because someone in thevalley or somewhere in Texas will youknow rapidly innovate and disrupt themso again it is now a new uh a new eraandall organizations are looking at how toreally leverage this technology to driveyou know growth or efficiency but alsouh you know watching their back makingsure they're not being disrupted as wellyeah so yeah and then so if we were totalk aboutI think a lot of people yes we need todo data governance Etc but one of theways I think we can also mitigate biasin all of these systems is when we startto look at the you know what data isneeded for the solutions I think themore people are part of that that humanin the loop you know that reinforcementlearning with human feedback is reallyreally key and so I I've spoken to quitea few customers this week and just ingeneral or the hallway conversations andquite a few of them said you know what Iactually didn't realize that I my jobstill matters even if it automates a lotof the things that were laborious rightyou know the road work that assumptionalso mentioned because I'm still thathuman in the loop and I'm still drivinga lot of these things and I can helpmitigate bias in the data sets that'sbeen used because my perspective stillmatters I know we hear this also from alot of our marketing customers we'reusing these to generate images generatecopies and things like that and so it'sawesome like I would like to understandobviously Singapore very Multiculturalright it's a center of Commerce and hubsand so how are you also able to take doyou have like a customer Advisory Boardyou know where you have all thesedifferent Industries represented to giveyou feedback on some of the solutionsum so so govtek as an organization it'sa it's quite interesting because we donot directly service our the citizensum we actually enable our agencies toservice the citizens and of course allthe agencies have their own uh forums tobe able to get feedback from from ourcitizens uh in fact we built a toolbuilt many tools for different agenciesto collect feedback uh from the citizensand very interestingly enough uh thisfeedback forms a number of use cases forAI JD AI because uh sometimes there'sjust too much feedback and you're notable to to really figure out what's thegeneral sentiment or the the overallfeedback or even like main clusters offeedback from the citizens and theirnumber of projects to to analyze thesefeedback and toum get insights from the journey AI llmrelated kind of use cases so so we dohave that and we also have tools wherewe enable citizens to directly givefeedback to us uh and and these are allprevalent for all the agencies andourselves as wellthat that's actually really really happyto hear that sowe have microphones and we actually havealso a micrunner um so I would love toopen it up so that we can actually getsome questions because we have thesegreat experts here we can help answersome of the questions does anyone haveany questions you'd like to askin uh some of your conversations withleaders board members have you found adirect correlation in the willingness toget involved in gen AI as it correlatesto their risk departments their theirposture the maturity of the organizationso they have a more robust riskassessment team risk team they're morewilling to take that challenge that leapinto Jenna have you seen a correlationthereyeah I can yeah absolutely I think youknow AI is not new many organizationshave been doing some form of AI from ayou know predictive AI Etc but uh Ihaving a data science practice having AIuh you know systems or having AIalgorithm running within theorganization obviously makes theexecutive team a little bit morecomfortable into jumping into this newthe new generative AI Trend definitelybut and uh organization that have notyou know not at the right level ofmaturity that haven't experimented withAI yeah this is really uh their lifetrying this to understand the conceptand they are not even prototyping yetbut the the organizations that I've seenexperiment and are actually now movinginto production use case have you knowsome level of maturity and AI experienceI'll just add to that that we see a lotof customers experimenting first withinternal use cases so use cases wherethey're providing assistance to theiremployees who are then assistingcustomers and that's an easier way aless risky way to test their way intothese generative Technologiesinsideoh there's one over there there's two sowe'll start your microphone's over thereand then we'll have youum second please yes helloum do you expect any or do you foreseeany sorts of uh regulation when it comesto uh the usage of uhi on um to thepublic orum do you see do you expect any sort ofa regulation when it comes to the usageof generative AI uh towards the publicor yeah we expect and we see a lot ofRegulation this is you know obviously acomplex space but we see every countryand every government trying to wraptheir heads around it and actually wesee globalum collaboration across Regulators asthey're trying to think through thisSingapore actually notably is one of thecountries that is furthest ahead inthinking through AI regulation as wellas you know the EU has a slightlydifferent slant from a privacyperspective and the U.S government areinvesting heavily in experts to geteverything up to speedum so I think we expect regulation weexpect to be a part of informing thatregulation and we expect to partner withothers who are also participating so Ithink it's going to be a fast-movingspace and I'm hoping that the Regulatorswill come forward with Frameworks thatmake sense and that can be built on overtime and don't don't eitherlock Innovation or trap us intoparadigms that you know we should beable to uh to go further with in termsof customer service or other areas of ofdevelopment and just to give you an ideawe're even working with you knowInsurance Regulators as well you knowlife insurance health insurance you knowauto insurance all of that and they'reeven thinking about how to to do youknow what regulation means in theirspace with regards to some of theseInnovation pieces next questionif you could speak to some of the kindof ways that you can monitor usage sothe thing that comes to mind is say auser asked a question and they didn'tquite get what they had or theirbuilt-in tools for them to say hey thatI didn't get to the answer I wanted foruse for you to dig in behind the scenesor even more importantly I got an answerand it doesn't pass my intuition checklike I know enough about this area thatsomething seems wrong and I want to flagthis for follow-up are there tools likethat built into Google's generative AIto you knowjust make that auditing process a loteasier yeah there's there's a couple ofways that we're uh we're thinking aboutand I'm sure Carlin and hamadu can uhcan expand on this but you know there'sas simple as a thumbs up thumbs downmechanism that uh that we'reimplementing across multiple products sothat uh you there can be user feedbackbut then obviously there'sum a number of model evaluation forFrameworks model biasum evaluation and analytics that we'rebuilding into the vertex platform and weannounced this week that allows you astechnologists within the Enterprise andwithin the organization to understandwhat's happening with the model and howusers are interacting with it yep plusone to everything that you just said andso if anything I would Rec I wouldencourage folks to to test it give usyour feedback see what how you like theexperience but you can also design yourown experience to collect some of thehuman feedback doing the ex you know thesolution that you're designing right andthen what the what that end userexperience is supposed to be I actuallyhave oh you have another question rightthere perfect because I have questionsfor you as the audience too so pleaseall right I'll be quickum when you look at data governance anduh journey I you have to secure a lot ofdata some of us have close to 100petabytes do you recommend focusing onjust the data sets that would beleverage for Gene AI today or go atscale and try to get it all of it doneI have an opinion on this one go firstso I um this is the chicken and eggproblem rightsome clients already have a project totest their data Fitness but they theyknow how to test it based on theoutcomes they're looking for so it makesit easier for them to chunk up the workthat needs to be done right whether it'sby domain or whether it's by businessfunction or whatever it is and so my myopinion is that if you know the thingand I said growth and efficienciesearliertrying to clean up your data as anefficiencies thing but if you know thatthis data set is going to help with thegrowth of the business that makes iteasier for you to go okay I need toclean this up first because that's goingto drive this project and then be ableto then go from there because otherwiseit's like oh my gosh all of this isgoing to take me three years how am Igoing to do that and so that's myperspective no I agree if you'recleaning all the data it feels like anI.T project really what you want to bedoing is delivering value to thebusiness and so thinking about the valueyou want to drive and connecting thatdata and then making that data readywould beum how I think we would prefer topartner with with our customers yeah howmuch do you want to yeah but and ifthere is one thing that really AI hashighlighted is and this is not new theimportance of a data strategy withinorganization right I think that AI withour data it's not there is no AI withoutdata and I think that many organizationsare really now accelerating their datastrategy figuring out where the datagravity what type of cloud providersthey want to they want to partner withto really form an information managementbut yeah honestly these models from atuning from a customization perspectivedo not need also massive amount ofinformation I think my uh Lisa andCarolina right just you know you canfocus on the right domain you that willprovide Value First have the right datathere and then iterate from there youdon't need a big Bank approach withinthe organization is the same thing whatyou've seen right different agenciesneed different things so you don't needa whole giant data set for all agenciesyes you don't but I I feel thatconversations I mean I I used to work inthe private sector as well governmentactually looks at things a little bitdifferently and I feel the agenciesumagencies being agencies they're all partof the government and from an outsideperspective it would seem like just justone government but the reality isthey're all holding on to differentpieces of the puzzleum bringing all of them together is amonstrous jobso so I would say if you belong to alarger organization a large Enterprisethink you somehow feel the same thingum because different business unitsmight be holding on to different partsof the puzzle and especially if thebusiness units actually don't operateunder the same uh business altogetherrightthen then there will be problem in indoing that and in that case data is ainfrastructural piece of work becauseyou need to string them together firstyou need to allow for discoverabilityyou need to have that uh mechanism whereyou can extract the data and put datafrom different parts together and alsohave agreements between the differentbusiness units because you know businessunits have business units have likeagencies as agencies they notnecessarily would cooperate with eachother as well as you think they wouldand therefore you need to have amechanism you need to have arbitratorsmoderators you know to make sure thatall of these pieces are put togetherproperly so it's actually quiteintensive to work but that's how we dowhat we're saying without data there'sno AI so it is a part and parcel of thejourney anyway yeah and if you want toactually have that fast use case thenyou probably want to look at the smallerones yeah and once you have proven itthen you can tell the powers to be theysay Hey you know this works but now weneed to do more scalables and skillsyeah there was another question hereum right in the fronthow you doing I have two questions um myfirst question is uh when you thinkabout data management once you have adata set with small or large and you runthat through the modelum now that that that model has learnedthat information do you need to maintainthe original data setit's first question to to continue to Idon't know so the model can continue tomaybe read it at some other point yeahnumber two once that model has beenprocessed that information does themodel itself now become a datagovernance entity that you now mustmanage now that knowsthe information that you that it processright now you can ask questions againstthat AIand get information and now is thatanother I don't know data managementpeace paradigm shift that you now haveto think about accessing these types ofthings okay so you want to take this oneso I I can take it first positive I'mnot sure if I'm going to answereverything that you asked but in generalyou train the model and then that modelitself is your model within your tenantso you don't need the data still therenow if you have user data that getsrefreshed all the time clearly you needa pipeline to continue to uh to informthe modelum and then your second question wasaround governance of that model I thinkgovernance comes with JCPum we have you know what we callSecurity horizontals in place across theorganization so data residency accesscontrolsum customer manage encryption keys thatall comes as part of the vertex platformpart of the gcp platform and so you yourmodels inherit inherit that inherentlyum hopefully that answered yourquestions but I'll ask yeah to add tothat I think like Lisa said again uh invertex AI for example we offer parameterefficiency training right you take datayou train the more you do some finetuning the result of that is an adaptermodel with some weight and that's reallyyou've generated new weight in that inyour adapter model that's what mattersright of course you need to continue togovern the source of information but themodel has been tried has been uh finetune it has a new weight it has anadapter layer then inference will takethat into account talk to the largerGoogle model and that's really how itworks so it's not just continue now ifyou want to retrain you want to do morefine tuning you of course uh obviouslyyou were free to do that but it'simportant to understand that there isnot this like real time connection toyour Source data once you do the finetuning you have no adapter model thatyour info your application will workwith I don't know if it helps butexactly well with that thank you verymuch for attending our session pleaseyou know fill out the feedback form inyour application in your app and I hopeyou have a fantastic rest of nextthank youforeign"
