    "transcript": "foreign[Music]it's nice to see you're still here Ihope you really enjoyed the three daysof conference and today I'm here withVlad we're both a product manager onGoogle Cloud conversational Ai and we'regoing to introduce you to the newfeatures that we are launching as partof vertex AI search and conversationum so we'll go to you know somebackground on generative Ai and thenwe'll do some live demos to show you allthese new features and we will have twospecial guests Peter from ING and Omarfrom Six Flags that will share with youuh their stories and how they use thegenerative AI features from Googleclouds to achieve their own goalsand now I will uh passage to vlads togive you the introthank you so muchuh so hi I'm Vladum I had a chance to work inconversational AI since several yearsstarting with the Google assistant in2016 and I wanted to start this talkwith you know my personal kind ofexperience in how during these just fewyears we totally changed the approach inhow we build conversational AIso when we launched oops the other waywhen we launched the Google assistant in2016 you know like a lot of theproduction real production systems areactually based on what the today couldcall prehistoric nlu basically we had uhyou know grammars written by you knowvery expensive resources so those werelinguists with phds who could also writecode and who you know who would writegrammars who can encode the you know thelanguage rules uh to kind of figure outthe user intent and it was like reallynot scalable we had one of theseresources per language was slow and notskilled in the meantimeso the research Community has beentrying to solve uh you know this withdeep learning right and the firstwinning approaches were basically totransform uh words into embeddings intovectors pass them into the deeper neuralnetworks and then you know transforminto something for example other wordsor you know some labels right and if wewanted to run full sentences throughthese models we have systems likerecurrent neural networks where it wouldbasically pass one a word at a time tothese modelsand uh and then basically you know againtransform into other sentences or otherlabels and while the systems you knowhad some initial success they actuallyhad two huge problems they were veryslow because of the kind of the natureof running them uh sequentially and thenalso they were like very poor Learnersuh they suffer problems like Vanishinggradients where we're trying to kind ofteach them a lot of data and thenliterally you know everything changedovernight uh when this paper waspublished this was in 2017 by a bunch ofgooglers uh that introduced you know theTransformer architecture and thetransform architecture had like reallyseveral almost magical properties likeincredible properties right first of alluh um this model like was superexpressive it could express manypossible algorithms very efficientlythen it was like a incredibly goodlearner it could learn really well froma lot of data and then lastly it kind ofprocess information in parallel and itallows us to kind of run it superefficiently on the on the best hardwarethat we have right so we basicallyachieved like orders of magnitude ofimprovement in terms of computationand uh you know it was like such animpact uh this paper it was selected byNature as the fourth most uh kind ofimpactful paper over the whole scienceyou know on the span for 15 to 20.um and you know if we look in the pastthree years what happened after thatactually that might have been anunderstatementum so the next kind of huge Improvementcame just the the the the the year afteragain in Google with Bert uh wherebasically the birth researchers figuredout that instead of using the usualmachine learning methods where we wouldkind of prepare a bunch of training dataand then train the system right weactually could use is the systemsprocess text like large acts of text toproduce text we actually could use atrick and then like use any article youknow on Wikipedia or any piece of textand just pretend that we don't know acertain word right and then we say heymodel try to guess this word but thereality we do know the word we know theoriginal text so we can actually use itto then tweak the model parameters rightand using this trick we could then youknow teach you know these models withbasically the whole human knowledge oncewe had you know scale enough parametersand this was like hugely impactful acouple of things you kind of came out ofthat like one is that you know when wewere pre-training this this large modelswith so much data they ended up beingextremely useful out of the box right sothese parameters that we use afterpre-training were actually you know veryuseful per seand not only that but actually we figureout that you can use them as a startingpoint to train Downstream to fine-tuneDownstream your further systems right sothese were like the two like I thinkreally the two biggest Innovations uhthat came out uh over these two years inGoogleum and then you know that those twoinnovations gave us like somecapabilities that were like totallyelusive to our community you know tryingto build conversational applications inthe years in the years previous to thatso in particular uh you know thetransform architecture finally you knowand the way it's trained kind of finallycould really understand context rightlike understand sentences understandsequence of sentences that was very veryhard to do before also it could generatea predict content and for the way it wastrained you know it could actuallycapture a lot of the World Knowledge andactually even some common senseand if we go like one step furtheryou know once you can understand contextand text and you can produce and answersomething appropriately you can actuallydo human dialogue right and then theother thing is that you know because ofthe nature of kind of generating andpredicting content with some new tricksto the edit of how we train these modelslike you know chain of thoughts andthings like that we were able toincreasingly create models that not onlycan you know understand and predict butcan also actually solve problemsumso now if you think about it like youknow if we have like a commodity acomponent that can do dialogue and weare able to creatively solve problemsthose are really the key ingredients tocreate a really capable assistant thatcan help through conversation users toachieve their goals rightum and this is like you know like all ofthese properties are fully new like wewere trying to to get to something likethat for many years there was like youknow in a very very hard suddenly we hadyou know all of that increasingly overtime over the past yearshowever before we can you know reallyrun this uh you know um properties anduse them in real production systems withreal users we had to solve someadditional problems so we you know wethese models are predictive engines sosometimes they make up information ifyou just use them out of the box withoutadditional you know systems around themuh you know it's easy to kind of easierto get really good quality with you knowlike huge uh models but sometimes it'snot practical because you want someconstant latency as well uh you knowthat you can afford and then on thedeveloper experience side you knowdevelopers want more control then justdon't want just a black box they throweverything out you know on and then theyjust hope for the best they want morecontrol also they want the ability tokind of handle complexity andscalability once they start adding a lotof use cases that you know these agentsneeds to do they don't want this butit's just cases to can interfere witheach other right but to scale uh welland then they want the ability to kindof you know to be able to fix problemswhere they identify a problem they wantto be able to fix it to fix a wholefamily so problems so next time thesystem is better right the school isgonna hill climbing and then obviouslyyou know this your system as well uh youknow had uh had to kind of respectprivacy security compliance rightum so basically uh you know what ourgoal is our goal is to give everybodytogether Enterprises around the world aplatform that is safe uh compliant andguarantees uh you know that your datastays that's still yours right thatgives you the ability to very easily youknow in few steps create very powerfuluh conversational applications but alsogives you the ability to then tune itand kind of customize it where you wantor need right so this is why this iswhat we are building with theconversational AI in vertex AIum giving you systems that are able toyou know answer complex queries bytransferring it from your data andgrounding in your data able to generateadditional content from its knowledge orstarting from your data and thentransforming it further right but alsoable to kind of you know go and completetasks on behalf of the user and transactto your you know using your API to yoursystemsumso how do we do that we do that bybasically building the full platformright in several layers on top of eachother right so we start with the GoogleCloud infrastructure on top of that youhave the model Garden where you getaccess to the best Google models and thebest open source models then we have theAI layer the vertex a platform layerthat allows you to you know to tune anddistill these models and kind of makethem like even more customized to yourneeds and your Enterprises on top ofthat we are adding a layer that allowsyou to really connect to your systemsright so the first is data connectors uhthat basically allow us allow you tokind of connect the agents to your datato your websites to your documents toyour you know databases and so on and sothat basically the agent is able tosearch in real time and get the datanecessary you know to continue theconversation and ask you other questionswe are adding extensions as you haveseen in the keynote we're basically uhnow you can also uh you know kind of uhuse the agent to communicate with yourapis and with your systems right andthen grounding super important becauseyou want these systems to be grounded inyour data in a factual and on top ofthat we are adding the conversational AIlayer right it allows you to build thisconversational applications and alsolike some features uh where where youcan put the control that you want as yousee you will see in a momentokay so here is basically like oneexample of how you can build anapplication in three easy steps rightsome new features that we are bringingum so the first one you just connectedyour data right so basically you canconnect with documents like your wholedomain uh you know your websites thatyou want or some other systems as wesaid before uh like uh you know somedatabases that you have or you knowthird-party systems like jira conferenceor whatever whatever you have right andthen suddenly like almost out of the boxyou have a bot or an agent that is ableto uh query all of this data search foruh you know for the relevant parts ofthe data real time get it back to theagent of the model right and then answerappropriately to the user questions thennext you can add extensions it willconfigure the existing one so you canadd your own so the system the thelarger image model can suddenly talk toyour apis rightum and the last thing is a new featurethat we are introducing to allow you tohave control over how certain tasks andsubtasks are executed this is veryimportantum basically like we are interested inthis feature where you can specify stepby step how you want certain tasks to beexecuted so now Solan will show us howthat works in practice thank youeveryoneso if you attended the keynote two daysago you remember that Nisha had walkedyou to the setup of a search app for theDMV website so today we're going to doit again but first a chat appso let's see see how it works we are onthe app builder here I'm going to createa new appso this timeVladimir I needOkay cool so you just missed one screenbut now you see itum we're going to choose theconversationappso I'm going to give it a name the DMVchatbotI enter the name of my company State DMVhere I have a bunch of options to makesure out of the box I get Knowledge frommy own data from the monad knowledge andconnection to the vertex AI extensionsnow I have the skeleton of my app I cando a few things first I want my chatbotto be able to find answers within my owndata so I have a bunch of options I canconnect a website I can connect andstructure data from bigquery or Googlecloud storage and soon you will be ablealso to connectdata from your own Services third partyservices that you used internally suchas jira Salesforce to be able forchatbot to find answers on this contentso here I'm going toadd the websiteand what will happen under the hood islike Enterprise search will Index thiswebsite to be able for the largelanguage model to use the search resultsto provide an answerso now I I gave it some data I will alsoyou know enable the the default vertexaextension so the bot can be smarter whenthe bot accomplishes some tasksand the last feature that I wanted toshow you in this Builder is this newplaybook feature where basically you candescribeinstructions in a natural language wayfor the bird to be able to complete sometasksso you don't even need you know to cutit you will just so here I will show youan example for all the tasks related todriver licenseyou just explain very simply what thechatbot has to do which information theyhave to ask and which API they have touse to complete some actionsso now let's seesee it in action how it works on mywebsite so I added the chatbot on theDMV websiteI going to ask the chatbed to somehow torenew mylicenseto the boat understands my requestasking me if anything has changed Yesactually I movedokay now it's telling me that I needactually to book an appointment andasking me where I want to goso I live in Los Gatosso now the body is going to chat tocheck on the DMV internal resources foravailability so that's what I describedin the Playbookand it's like suggesting a fewappointments I'm going to choose the 230and then we're going to call differentextensions for the board to be able tocreate an event in my Gallant calendar Igenerate a summary with the llm and sendan email to my Gmail account so I cannot forget this appointmentI'm all set so you've seen like uh oneaspect of this chatbot I'm going to showyou a second one because this time Iwant to actually find a bit moreum information uh that will be found onthe website so for instance I don't knowif I actually do I needa mottocycling licensefor my Vespaso this is you know infoseking queriesthe boat is going to look on the websitefor an answer because I previouslyingested this websiteand now the body is also going toautomatically uh give me an answer so aquick summary with a link with acitation of where you know thisinformation was found on the website andalso here I got super cool interactionwhere I'm redirecting on the right pageso I can verify the informationso actually I don't know the side of theengine but I know that I have aprimaveraVespaso now they both understand the contextof the conversation that I'm stillasking about my Vespa but I havePrimavera and the boat in that situationcouldn't find the information directlyon the website so the board was lookingfor information on the llmself-knowledge and provide me with someinformation about different uh PrimaveraVistaso that's it and I think we all agreethat this is you know both as a botBuilder and as an end user theexperience that we want to have and thisis now possible with the new vertex AIsearch and conversationQuebec[Applause]okay so in case you are a dialogflowuser and you're wondering you know whatis what is happening with our course weare bringing all of these features alsoto dialogflow and you can basicallyextend your existing Bots and ages thatyou have there with using these featuresso then we'll do them on that or buildnew Bots merging the best of the of theof Both Worlds you know we have like thefull control of dialogflow and then alsocertain parts that you can design in thegenerative way uh so so then we'll gothrough that we are adding these threenew features answer from contentgenerator responses and playbooks and Ithink it's best to see it in actiondirectly so please join thank you so canwe switch to the demothank you so you know as a new productmanager for all these features anddirect flow when we launched them inpreview two months ago I was inundatedwith feature requests uh questions fromcustomer Engineers but of course so Iwanted to build a bot that helped me tomanage all this like volume of queriesand so I built Felix with all this newfeature and today I'm going to show youboth how Felix helped me to do this andalso how we built Phyllis Felix with thegenetic features on the workflowso let's start with something you knowjust easy hi thereso now I get this you know answer whichis actually a response that I uh wroteon Direct flow so this no llm this iskind of you know the way the old way ofbuilding a boat where based on sometraining phrases you get a response soyou can see that this is the exactresponse hereso now if I go a bit you know outside ofthis training phrases and I say hi theremy nameis CelineI'll get a different answer but Felix iseven telling me hi Celine this is notthe same respawn this is like a responsegenerated by dlnm because for thisfeatureII just use opt-in for the generativefallbackhere you will see it I just obtained forgenerative fallback which means that ifit goes outside of the training phraseswe'll let the llm generate a nice andcontextual answerso now let's see how actually Felix canhelp me to for customer Engineers tofind answers under the general Builderso howto buildchatbotswith app builderforeignso now Felix is giving me a summary ofthe instructions to build a chatbot thatyou can see here just in a few steps aswell as a link which is again thecitation that was used to generate theanswer so I have a granted answer basedon my own data and how did I do this indialog flow I just connected to like thedata star feature my own website thatwas you know ingested the same way thatwe did it for the DMV website I did ithere for this documentation websiteso this is super easy this comes justout of the boxnow I want Felix to do even more can youwrite codesgreat Felix can even write code so whatabout you write code to upload filesto a Google storage packetscool Felix is like giving me the exactcodes to do thiswhy how does it workso I use the generator features which isa new feature on dialogflowwhich basically will be triggered bya fulfillment and here you can see thatI just wrote a simple prompt that tllmwill use every time I say write codewith a few parameter to make sure thatthe llm knows about the context of theconversationthat's the generator feature super coolrightand now I will show you the last featurewhich is basically what we showedpreviously with the Playbook that youcan also do on dialogflow so you know Iwanted to also make sure that Felix canhelp me to manage all the featurerequests and create ticket directly onour own systemso I wrote a simple Playbookto capture all the feature requests so Ididn't do I didn't need to code anythingI just write a list of instructions withthe parameters and how to connect it toour own systemand now let's see how it works so I wantto file a feature requestsso then Felix will follow this list ofinstructions asking me what the name ofthe feature requests comparison tableI want actually the llm to generatetable to compare productsexcuse me why this is critical becauseTMV customerneeds it nowand then asking me about myemail address and now the featurerequest will be sent directly to ourinternal system we'll still have toprivatize the request and make sure weimplement it but this really helped meto kind of gain productivity so you cando all of this with now the app builderand dialogflow[Applause]okayso so far we talked only about chatexperiences but conversational AI ismore than that it's also about voiceright and even more than just voice soGoogle has been investing in voiceexperiences since many yearsand in particular voice basically meantwo things misunderstanding whensomebody's speaking and then being ableto produce you know human-like voices onthe other end uh so in terms ofunderstanding uh the users we have thenewest USM models that can understand uhtranscribe hundreds of languages andalso uh Google is investing this projectto actually go way beyond that andthere's thousands of languages inactually like a superhuman way becauseit understands the you know the likeeven in noisy environments across likeso many languages rightum in terms of uh kind of languageproduction so once we have kind of likethe answer from the agent in text wewant to say to the user in a voice thatis sounding As Natural as possible sothis is also like a something veryimportant where we have been investing alot and let me show you a couple ofimprovements so one of the features thatwe have isbasically the ability uh you know tokind of create a custom voice so we justneed a few minutes of a recording of anactor and then we can create a voicethat is identical to that of the actorthat can say anything right so here's anexample so we have created uh we wecreated a custom voice and then afterthat we have a new sentence that wasn'tyou know part of the training and we welet it kind of read out what the bot andthe human and I want you to try to guesswhich one is button which one is humanokayah it's there okay okayeveryone's strengths came together itbegan with a broken Funk pattern fromthe piano and the horns ran harmonizedchromatic lines through itso this was the first one is the secondonein New Amsterdam everyone's strengthscame together it began with a brokenbunk pattern from the piano and thehorns ran harmonized chromatic linesthrough it what do you think which onethe one on the left one on the right sowho is for the one on the leftwho is for the one on the rightthat's half half so I need to be honestI forgotbecause we changed these light so manytimes I I really forgot umI I can figure it out with you knowheadphones like when I really listen butyeah anyway so this is this is one wayuh you know but it still to kind ofsound really natural right but on top ofthatum what you also want sometimes is tokind of Infuse emotion that we want youknow into the language so here is acouple of uh just examples of how we canbasically say something with differentemotionsum so this is like a casual voice thatyou can say something rightaccount balancesum 92.50 this is like perfect kind ofyou know like a board agent in a contactcenterthis is like a more lively uh if I wantthis great for marketing uh for examplethis is a very exciting time to beworking on artificial intelligence rightum or you know if you want somethingmore firm then you can use this howeverit is important that we take our time tomake sure the work we are doing is safeand ethical alternative right and myfavorite is the apologetic voiceunfortunately we can't give you any morediscounts yeah[Applause]yeahso uh exactly um so I'll skip actuallyuh in order to make time so the um oopsthe other the other kind of feature youknow is like voice is great butsometimes it's really really hard to geteverything via voice like there'scertain information there's just like somuch easier to either input orunderstand if there is an image inbetween right or there is anarchitectural input interface so we'relaunching as well uh call Companionfeature that basically is a companion tothe voice conversation uh with a userand so then can uh play a video oh yeahthank you yeah so we couldn't do it liveuh because of because the room sowe prepared the video for you[Music]hi I am the Google call Companioninsurance agent how can I help youmy car had aan accidentI'm very sorry to hear that before wecontinue is everyone safeI'm relieved to hear that everyone isall right would you like me to help youfile an insurance claim for the incidentyesI would be happy to help let's getstarted can you please enter the accountnumber for your insurance policythank you I was able to locate theaccount the policy owner is listed asJane Smith the vehicle on record is a2022 Futura Impreza there is a collisionliability limit of fifty thousanddollars and a personal liability limitof one hundred thousand dollars doesthis sound correct yeson what date did the incident occurtodayI will enter the date as the 30th ofAugust 2023. what was the city and statewhere the incident occurredthank you I will record the location asSan Francisco California did theincident occur in your future Imprezathank you for confirming this is thefirst of three questions I'll need toask about the incident was this a singlecar or multi-car accidentgot it were there any passengers in yourcar at the time nofinally were you issued a ticket on thescene no I wasn'tcan you please upload a photo of thedamagephoto received I appreciate yourpatience during this process the claimhas been filed and you will be contactedby a representative to follow up within48 hours is there anything else I canassist you with today nothank you again for contacting us have agreat day[Applause]so this was an example of what you couldbuild it's called company including somenatural cues like them uh ability to useboth the visual interface as well aswiseI think it's well done right so thankyou so much this was our part so now wewould like to invite our dear customerstooum tell their experience using theproducts[Applause]I'm Peter from ING I'm very excited tobe here I'll give a quick explanationabout why we do what we do in thecontact centers today and then a smalldemo thank you on the initiatives thatwe're taking together with Google sowithin ing I think for the people whodon't know ing we're a bank with amostly European footprint we have about37 million customers 10 retail countriesand then we're also active also Bankingand other activities uh we're active inmany different languages which is veryrelevant for our our testimonial heretoday as a bank we focus a lot onproviding a superior customer experiencemaking it fast personal easy andrelevantwe we are NPS we're the highest NPS andfive out of 10 retail markets and we'reinvesting a lot in that we also havea very strict cost discipline there's abit of an echo am I the only one hearingthatthere's a very strict cost discipline inthein our operations and in our contactcenters we've set ourselves a goal toreduce incoming contacts by 30 percentby 2025. now how do we do that we have alot of focus on bringing DigitalServices through our mobile appwe do we promote chat as a preferredChannelum so there's a lot of chat automationchat Bots happening there and uh for allthe human interactions of course we dowant to keep the emotional connectionwith our customers it's very importantto us also towards that NPS again but wewant to do that in a scalable way andthere becoming language agnostic isquite important to us so in terms oftransformation drivers that uh um thatare enabling that we see uh first timeright responses reducing on the trainingtime sometimes we're up to 20 percent ofagent time today that gets invested inin training and we want to increase onthe quality and the consistency of theadvice and information that is given toour customerswe have already pretty large chatbotsdeployed in multiple countries we'vebeen working with dialogflow for morethan three years now so we were lookingfor an Enterprise grade partner thatcould indeedallow us to scale rapidly across ourmarkets and we're doing that todaybut what we've seen is that we'rehitting a certain Plateau we have Botsthat yeah fire out go uh yeah that goabove 1000 intense easilyum and so we're looking for new waysthat helps us to both increasedeflection rates with our Bots but atthe same timeenable us to speed up deployment of botswhen we enter into new marketsand then the third one it's what I justmentioned we do want to make sure thatwhen we are contacting customers that wecan do that in a language agnostic waybecause that way we can scale ourcontact centers across the globe if onein Belgium is occupied and someone fromthe Netherlands or elsewhere can takeovernowgetting to the gist of it what are wedoing today there's a lot of thingshappening within ing but we focus a loton two initiatives the first one is theagent assist so what happens is there isa a chat agent that gets supportfrom a tool that tool listens in to thechatthe chat agent injects a query into theagent assist tooling and then gets theresponse I'll quickly show how it worksso what happens is the chat agentchooses the language injects thequestionand then we have a couple of knowledgebases in there those go from web pagesto training material to other types oftemplatesand then every time we have the URL wehave the reference to where whatdocument is it foundand we actually monitor two things soyou see at the right hand sideyou saw two things you saw one did wefind the correct resource and two wasthe answer that was generated thecorrect answer so meaning was it usefulwere you able to inject it back into thechat towards the customertoday we have so we're live with thatandumwe're we're improving performance as wego so we were at 36 on Leverageum we're way up on web pages we're waydown on PDFs but we're in the midst offixing that so now we're at 50 percentwhere we can just do like the generatedresponse and inject it backum yeah and we're striving to be by the4th of October that's my birthday uh onthe level of 90 that's the objectivethat we've set out for ourselvesand we're confident that we will makethat happen as well so this is uh thisis where we are today there's a coupleof improvements that we want to have wewant to make it as we said languageagnostic so French operator Dutchcustomer that we can fulfill thatJourney uh with some translation is itllm is it the the Google Translate inbetween we're playing with that as wespeak we want to make sure that wegenerate an answer out of all thedifferent knowledge bases into oneanswer and there's a couple ofimprovements that we're working ontogether with Google and we're very muchlooking forward to to those and thenvery quickly because I only have fiveminutes but I could probably talk aboutthis one for for an hour is that we'realso fully testing now in sandbox ourgenerative AI chatbotthis one is launched in the Dutch Marketand uh or will be launched in the DutchMarket as soon as we are confident um soit's clearly mentioned here within riskappetite we're a bank so we have 13factors against which we're currentlyum constantly evaluating continuouslyimproving our guardrail mapping we havellms testinga second llm testing againsthallucination we we have llms checkingdon't we give any advice aroundInvestments which we're not allowed todo through these channels uh is theright tone of voice thereetc etc so we're um we're making bigsteps there it looks very promising wehaven't launched just yet but we'rewe're quite closehold on so with that I'll hand over toOmar from six tracks thank you[Applause]all right thank you everybody for foryour timeum my name is Omar Omron I'm the chiefdigital officer for Six Flagsand before starting I want to thank theSix Flags team Jody Patrick Steve a lotof the people who worked really hard tomake what I'm about to talk about happenand I also want to thank the Google teamLionel cam Aaron so many great peoplewho made this happen and also a companycalled Feud who helped design the frontend also of the conversation AI chatbotnow Six Flagsis a fun company so let's have some funthank you very much[Music][Music]let's golet's go[Music]let's goall right who likes roller coasters hereraise your handsthat's amazing it's almost everybody solet's put some numbers about what SixFlags isSix Flags is the largest regional themeparks with 27 Parks spread in NorthAmerica and is the largest water parkoperator also in the world we have morethan 20 million visitors that come toour Park every year70 of them are in six hour drivingdistance to one of the parksand then we have also many parks withbeautiful animals and one interestingfact that you might not know Six Flagshas the biggest Safari outside of Africaand it's actually located in one of ourparks in New Jerseynow whenever youtalk about digital transformation acrosssix lugsit's actually more than just a websiteor maybe an appit's a it's all across Six Flags so fromthe rise and roller coaster from yourexperience at the at the right that willchange through digit transformation howyou visualize it how you experience ithow you listen to it the food andbeverage how you order food instead ofwaiting in line from your app from akioskhow you you enter actually the parkwe're the first Park to now automate thetall Plaza so just put your licenseplate and then the toll plazas willautomatically open for you and you go inso you wait much less to enter the parksfrom parking security how you buy yourtickets it's it's all acrossandSix Flags has always been uh the com thetheme park with the best rise andinteractionand right now we're very much posed toalso start leading on Innovation acrossthe industryand in order to do this we need astrategic partner to help us get thereso that's why we partnered we did astrategic partnership with Google inorder to accelerate thatand whenever you're talking aboutbuilding the theme park of the futureelevating the guest experience that hasexperience no longer start at the parkthe cancer experience starts even beforecoming to the park whenever you'reonline exploring what you'd like to dowhenever you go to Six Flags buying yourticket buying your season pass going tosocial media getting an email getting anSMS about six lakhs to entering the parkfrom again from your car into the tallPlaza to find the right spot for youscanning your ticket whenever you comeindo getting a flash pass skipping thelines ordering food ordering retail toeven when you leave the park gettinginformation more about how was yourvisitso the key behind it is we would like tomake this whole experience personalizedand in order to make it personalizedthat's why we also with our strategicpartner with Google start using gen AIfor itnow I'll ask you one questionwho likes to go sometimes to the samerestaurant because you know the host orthe waiter and they always take care ofyou because they know your preferencesraise your handthat's exactly it and that's theopportunity that is in front of youthat's the opportunity that we're alsoworking with Google on it in order tocut to make the whole uh experience atthe park completely personalized fromonline whenever you're shopping we askyou for your preference and then westart tailoring the whole experience foryou before you go and then when you cometo the park we're able to navigate youtake you to the restaurants where youlike the most where you don't haveallergy to and the best roller coasterthat you would like to enjoy or FamilyRidesand what's right now we're doing withGoogle is the website and the app we'reboth building uh a chatbot powered bygen AI in order to be able to live theguest experience and I don't know aboutthe 30 maybe it's uh what Pierce saidsame to us we're going to be able toautomate 30 of all the questions thatguests will usually ask us onlineand what's a very important for us aswell is that the data is grounded withinsix lags because we want to always uhmake sure that the guest information iswell protected and being able to
