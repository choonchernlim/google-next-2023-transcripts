also have the privilege to be talkingto you todaytogether with our partners from ukg whoare going to join us in a secondfrom ukg we're going to hear from ScottHowardChief digital officer and from MustafaKappa Chief Information Security Officerhere's what to expectfirst vinod and I are going to reflecton one of the key drivers to trust thatwe've learned from talking to customersand also how Google Cloud approachesthoseand then we'll invite Scott and Mustafathat to tell us about their securitydigital transformation Journeynow before I beginI want to set a bit of contextand give you a little bit of backgroundon what we not and I do every daywe are part of Google Cloud's cybersecurity action teamand we along with our colleaguesmeet with Enterprises from around theworldevery daywe talk to leaders that are responsiblefor information securityfor privacy for compliance for securityfor procurementleaders like Scott and Mustafa elitistslike many of you here in the roomand our goal is twofoldfirst and foremost listen to what eachof your organizations need as younavigate that migration to cloud andsupport you along the cycles of thesecurity transformation Journeyfrom early road maps and implementationto preparedness for potential events andincidents and to engineering newSolutionsthe second part of our jobs is workingwith product and Engineering teams andadvocating for the things we hear fromyouwhat is top of Mind in the areas ofsecurity privacy and compliance so wecan prioritize building thoseI mean our conversations with customerswe learned that when an Enterprise makesa decision to move data and applicationsto Google Cloudand especially most sensitive data andMission critical applicationsit comes down to trusttrust that Google Cloud will storemanage and process your information inaccordance to your requirements and yourpreferencesthat trust is critical and we also knowthat trusting is a choicewhen we reflect on the conversationswe see one principle the so-calledparadoxof trustit goes like thisit is easier to trustthe less you need to trustlet me give you an example to illustratethatimagine you have two choicesonetrust the cloud providerthat has a lot of well-developed dataand security controlsand twotrust the cloud provider that has a lotof well-developed data and securitycontrolsand the ability to get a queue thecustomer hold the encryption key to allyour datawithout any ability for the provider tosee or access the keyfor surethere are many controls that play agreat deal in building trust and in asecond I'm going to tell you about whatwe see as most critical in ourconversationsbut we remain ourselves grounded to thatprincipleit is easier to trustthe less that customers need to trustthe cloud providerokaynow let's learn let's look at thewhat we've learned from conversationsfrom youin the context of cloud computingbased on our experience we see five keydrivers for trustnumber oneand that's the one we hear in almostevery conversations with customeris the need for you the customer toultimately retain control of your dataon an infrastructure you don't own andmanageand we have found that the way we assurethat controlhow transparent we are of how we handlethe data and how we build privacyassurancesthat is the most critical in earning andretaining your trustnumber two the second driver of trust wehear in conversation is the ability toprovide protection from businessinterruptionsthis is non-negotiable for criticalinfrastructurebut we also hear it from many others andcovet was a great reminderthe ability to know that your data andapplications will be there when you needthemis critical for governments BanksHealthcare Providers e-commercebusinesses and many othersnumber threethe third driver for trust we hear fromour customers is the ability to offerrobust protections against threats andhackersthe sheer scale of modern attacksand growing according to experts I sawwith article 40 year on yearand the sophisticationof motivated adversariesmake this a priority for allorganizationscustomers tell us that they trust Googleto offer our battle tested technologyFrontline intelligence to protectagainst threats that we see that GoogleSees and defends against every daythey trust us moreif we can build the confidence thatthreats from ransomware accounttakeovers phishing Bots and many moremodern attacks are indeed minimizeddetectable and recoverablefor driver for trust and we hear thatfrom Financial Services institutionsHealthcare Life Sciences highlyregulated customers is the ability tomeet their complexand growingRegulatory Compliance requirements andnot just offer assurances andcertifications we really work with themalong the journey from onboarding toCloud to increasing their workloads andfinding ways to simplify complianceand last but not leastand we're in an inflection pointcertainly has been the conversationhomeowningwe find the correlation between trustand how we and our collect and ourcustomers collectively think and addressare responsibly towards the environmentand most importantly how thoughtfullyand how responsibly we think aboutdeveloping deploying and using AdvancedTechnologies such as generative AIso here we arefrom our conversations we hear the fivekey drivers for trustthat Google Cloud customers tells usand now I'm going to invite my colleaguevinod to tell you a little bit of how wein Google address thosethank youthank you Tanya[Applause]so now like uh let's look at each one ofthe reasons in more detailso the first oneGooglewe are explicit in our commitmentfor our customersyou control your databasically we start with ourcommitment to transparencyby through the private the um thePrivacy commitments as well as the dataprocessing addendumwe don't use your data forlike say for ad purposes I think that'sone of the question keeps coming upquite more often we don't use it forAI model Improvement or any productImprovementyou control what happens to your datawe store process and manage our dataaccording to your preferencesso all customers Leverage The robustprivacy and security controlsthat are built in in Googleincluding the defaultuh data encryption at rest and intransit so in addition to these defaultcontrolswhich are many times sufficient to meetthe needs of most of most of ourcustomers we also offerum additionalIndependence on your control to uh tomanage your sensitive workloadssome examples are you can configure yourgcp services and workspaceto store your datain the location of your choice or youselectnext one the secure securing workloadsto prevent deployments outside ofselected Geo boundariesyou can audit and approve say forexample Google support Engineers uhtrying to access your data for supportor engineering reasonsyou can store and manage encryption dataoutside of Google cloud with just kindof Tanya went over and we can approveyou can approve the decryption requestto access that data in the cloudenvironmentand also preserve the confidentiality ofyour data while it's being processedusing confidential computingthe other aspect of it is we neverprovide anythird-party backdoor access to your dataand you know we share our thetransparency reports and you know how weprocess government requests for um youknow the the data request that and andthose reports are available publiclyuh you also have as a customervisibility into our sub processorsand their scope their locations andtheir function and how they uh processour data and again it's very limitedwhere where it is needed that weleverage some processes for thatwe enableddata portability and lock-in in ourphilosophy is you know we want to besupportive and thorough support to opensource Technologiesit's like we don't want you to lock inbut we want you to allow using productsin our technology so that you keep usingit soyou know we provide tools to securelyexport your data in case if you need toyou know if you decide toum you know choose another provider oror you find another mechanism to processyour Computing so you know there aretools available to securely export yourdata from gcp and workspacethe second reasonGoogle's Global infrastructure isdesigned to be resilient and to bescalable and it is not an afterthoughtso this is for maximum reliability aswell as uptimeso we have at Google Cloudgeographically distributed data centersall operating as primary sites tominimize the effects of any disruptionin the regional Regional level so yourworkloads are securely distributedacross multiple regions availabilityzonespoints of presence and network cables toprovide strong built-in redundancyGoogle own networkum you know is for it also provides thelow latency as well as scalableperformance which has thousands of milesof a fiber optic cableI always joke in some of my executivebriefings that one additional thing thatGoogle has to worry about when it comesto Securities like the shark biting ouroptic cables in the Deep oceans but youknow we do have Solutions and we havefound a way to kind of manage that aswellredundancy of everything you knowautomatic failover of tools like we wantto make sure that every Hardwarecomponent as in the critical path of aservice is replicated so that there isno system failure no single componentfailure so that you know none of thiscan bring down a servicethe second aspect is uh you know I wantto touch upon is all Google cloudservices are designed to serve um youknow survive the data center failure andwhat does what does that mean is gcpServices reside at multiple gcp zonesand regions and are highly available wedo continuous data replication based onthe service type and the demand of thatserviceuh we have high level of serviceavailability and these slas arepublished for you to see on our portalsor our websites and you have alsovisibility into our service status andoutages you know we provide thatdashboard again it's publicly availablethe other aspect of what I want to touchupon is the operational controls that wehave for resiliencywe have business continuity plans tomake sure that the core businesses arecontinuing to run and maintain uh wehave these business plans focus andconsider all aspects of system failureall aspect of any um threat to peopleand we do have annual large-scaleDisaster Recovery testing which are someyou know theoretical practical you knowwhich kind of varies from you know theservice stress testing full data centerum you know outage testingsum how we can respond to simulatednatural disasters and many moreand not only that right we also providetools and strategies to help you designprocesses and Safeguard against any dataloss at the application Levelas well as you know for the data thatyou use within your applicationmoving on to the third um you know thereasonis about data protectionat Google we defendyour data against all threats andfraudulent using the same infrastructurethat and the security services we usefor our own operationsempering you with the advancedcapabilities and many of the times thesecapabilities areavailable to those who havewell-resourced organizations Globalorganization but could be unavailable tomany newer emerging companiesand our infrastructure that you dependdesigned to deliverleverages the defense in depth scalewe run on a technology platform that isconceived designed built keepingSecurity in mindour infrastructurerely on not on single technology butrather itthrough the progressive layers thatdeliver defense in depththe bond you know depending on theservice you consume there is always ashared responsibility but the underlyingfact is thatGoogle is always responsible forsecuring the underlying infrastructureuh one of the evolution from the sharedsecurity responsibility model is thatyou know the shared fate where Google ispartnering with you to make sure thatyou know you get the best practices toum to to secure your environment wherewe leverage blueprint we shareBlueprints and other tools andTechnologies and best practices so thatyou know we have we are actuallypartnering you to secure that as wellthe other aspect is uh you know thesecurity uhby Design willum end-to-end keeping an end-to-end mindof the origins of chips to our datacenters so one of the aspect is wecontrol the hardware the network and thesecurity stack so thatumany any uh that we can maintain thesecurity postures and it reduces thesecurity exposure to supply chain riskyou must have heard about the zero trustmodel using the uh cryptocryptographically secured identityidentities to N40 trust model what thatmeans is we ensure our individual orservice leverages authentication andauthorization based on the context thatis available for a request including theuser identity uh the location deviceownership the device configuration andfine-grained access policies to evaluatethe risk evaluate the request based onits validity and guard against phishingand other malware type of you knowattacksoperational controls to Google'sinfrastructure we manage both externalinternal incidents we providevulnerability and malware detection andRemediation mechanismsand you know stringent protocols that wehave aroundum around data and security incidentsyou have access to gcp's Native andpartner solutions to providewith the you know autonomy to manageyour security in the cloud which wealready talked about you know externalkey manager where you can manage thekeys and you know you candecrypt those access requests even forour support and engineering team forcustomer related thingsbut what it means is in the fourthprinciple we'll touch upon moving to themoving the cloud moving to the cloud ormoving the workloads to the cloud meansprotecting sensitive information whileachieving them and maintaining thecompliance against complex regulatorysecurity requirements depending on whichindustry you're fromI think which we already touched upon wemaintain uh world-class independent uhattestation across Internationalstandards we provide ongoing support forall the customers and especially for theregulated customers with verifiable andauditable commitments on securityprivacy and complianceregulations such as gdpr which as youknow places significant emphasis onuh knowing how your data is beingprocessedwho has access to your data how aresecurity incidents are managed and we atGoogle cloud has dedicated complianceand Engineering experts to kind ofsupport our customers to meeting thesestringent requirements and our approachincludescollaborating with you and the customersto make sure that your needs yourrequirements are understood we provideyou know reports of our attestationsalong with a lot of other certificationdocument documentation to assist you andwe work with you uh to you know in anIntegrated Controls and developmentgovernance framework for you to besecure and be compliantthe last and one of the reason wantedthe fifth one is our customers come tous not only to benefit from thetechnology they come to us because ofour culture of innovation they want toco-innovate with usas an example we collaborate with a lotof the customers some of you are here todevelop solutions to apply Ai and mlspecific to business challengesone of the other aspects I want to touchupon here is cloud Solutions can helpyou address sustainability and socialresponsibility goalslike Google data centers are 2x moreenergy efficient as a typical EnterpriseData Centeryour workloads are have zero netoperational carbon emission on GoogleCloud so efficient data center can helpyou help you to meet your sustainabilitygoals as welland we have ongoing commitment toresponsible and explainable AI so wewant to make sure that you have thetools and products such as AI principleml guides Google Cloud XML explainableAI to help build and inclusive and fairuh Advanced Technologies and we workhard to scaleour diversity equity and inclusioninitiatives andyou know product accessibility featureshelp anyone to use these tools and toget more done long-term PartnershipsHealthum you know that we have with theeducational institutions uh externalcommunitiesum other organizations and you knowother suppliers to make sure that wecontinue to work hard towards thatdiversity and equityso you know it's a journey and you knowwe would continue to work with you ascustomers as partners collaborate onthis journey and many more organizationsto make sure that many moreorganizations trust Google Cloudand it becomes one of your valuableasset in Secure from a security andcompliance perspective and we willcontinue to invest Google Cloud to uh toachieve this goalandnow you know in this journey I want tocall upon Scott and Mustafa on stage whowill share the ukg security storywhich is a digital a security digitaltransformation story with Google CloudScottall rightawayall right so I'm Scott Howard I'm thechief digital officer at ukg and what Iwanted to share with you is why wedecided to go with gcp to help us in ourtransformation story and one of thethings that accelerated so I started atukg last year in January of 22.what had happened in December of 22 iswe had a or of 21 we had a what wecalled a private Cloud environment whichwas our own data center environment andwe hosted a lot of customers thereand we had a lot of the traditionalcontrols in place to encrypt our dataand Safeguard our access and all thatbut we did have a threat actor come intoour environmentand so they tried to steal the data andthe data remained secureso you know they tried to get someelevated access they couldn't get itthey tried a few ways to Port out ourdata they couldn't get itand so they decided Wellsince I can go ahead and I can't get thedata what I'm going to do is justdestroy the environment so they deployeda piece of ransomware and within aboutan hour and a half we had 18 000 serversthat were totally encrypted and wipedout and inaccessible to usand so you know it took us about 30 daysto restore all of our customers and inwhat we learned out of that is you knowone of the things that the FBI touted ishey we bested up fin seven and all thathappened is fin7 became ryuk then theybecame conti and then finally the onethat hit us which was black cat soyou'll never eliminate the criminalelement they'll Splinter they'll alwaysbe there and so it really made us thinkdifferently about how we approachsecurity where before it was oh if Ihave all the safeguards in place and Ibuild my walls high enough it's good butwe never conceptualized that well whathappens when you just destroy the wholeservice right which is the basis of alot of these ransomware attacks so we'regoing to have to make these environmentshighly resilient for our customers tooso we thought what are the coreprinciples as we go forward and so youknow I think one of them you see with alot of security people is okay I have aproblem I'll go find a securitytechnology all bolted onand we really want to think of it asmore of a platform play how do I build asecurity ecosystem that blends in withmy traditional infrastructure andbecomes a part of it and we harmonizethat togetherand then the second thing we looked atis there's a lot of manual automation alot of manual decision making how do welean more into automation maybe AI tohelp us make some of those decisions anddo thatwe also you know our talent was highlyspecialized and highly localized onlycertain people knew certain things sohow do we democratize that knowledge andshare it around and then two you know asyou lean into a cloud provider it wasexactly what we were talking aboutbefore is what's my responsibility inwhat's Google's responsibility as we goforward and so that was one of the keythings that why we choose Google as apartner is not only did we have theability to lean into a more modernplatform to build these things out butwe also had their expertise not just inbuilding the cloud cloud platform itselfbut also we relied on mandiant to helpus put some of the security things intake care of some of our security toilis we built this outso what I want to do right now is I'llturn it over to Mustafa keba who is aCSO at ukg and he'll go over how webuilt it outthank you Scott[Applause]all right thank you I want to talk alittle bit aboutsome of our security focus and it givesyou a little bit of what we're doingbased on what Google has talked abouttoday and some of the key capabilitiesthat they have it's it's aboutcollaboration it's not just what they'redoing it's just not what they have butthe key components ofeverything that's going the fourth thingis when we think about this coming intoukg and what Google provides and otherCloud provides what do we need to dofundamentally across the board to makesure that we're secure but we need tohave one mindset which is Security Firstwhat is our first mindset as we take alook at everything that's going on thesecond thing is we should defend as oneit's not a gcp it's not Google it's notmy developers it's not a security teambut if we don't come together as one wecan't secure anything so the fundamentalpiece is defend as one as one group byunderstanding each and everyone'sresponsibility and coming together tocreate a better secure infrastructureand the last key one here that talksabout include increase the resilienceright that's a key component of what wedohaving the resiliency being able torespondhave backups and Recovery its keycapability is way cheaper than yourcyber Insurance out thereso we need to be able to make sure thatwe understand what are your keycomponents what do you have running inyour Enterprisewhat's critical to your infrastructurethat needs to have resiliency and forukg that's the key things that we'velearned about what happened and then howdo we change that and fundamentallylooking into that is making sure thatyou have the right partners that havegood infrastructure and then speed to beable to recover when is neededI'm going to talk about what have wedone after that we've collaborated withGoogle in many ways one of them is Mandyand group the other is the Googlesecurity teams we're literally lookingat their Cloud infrastructure and howthat could power some of the work thatwe're doing and then we started in acouple of areas one of them is scalableplatform what can we do to make surethere are platforms that we'releveraging are scalable enoughfor us to be able to extend our securitycapabilitythat's one uh the second one here isas we think about all of thiswhat's our what's our architecture looklike right how are people accessing thiswhich are the zero trust model everyonehas a model of what zero trustarchitecture look like but as we thinkabout this is what's the access looklike who's accessing in my environmentwhere are they accessing it from socontextual awareness into your accessand many people are thinking aboutoutside but what about Insight rightsoftware we have SAS company so the thethe developers that are developing inour platform what are they doing whattype of access do they have and then howoften are we monitoring this is a keycomponent to driving the right securecapabilityum and if you do all of this you need tohave good detectionmore importantly you need to have aresponse capabilityto be able to respond quick enough andfast enough for any cyber event that youhaverightwhilst you're doing that we've seen alot of data we've seen a lot ofevents that are coming on a daily basison everyone here that's a securityperson or have a sock there's a lot ofinformation that you have to deal withso understanding the scale being able toleverage different Intel and informationthat drive you to successfully respondto the key security events that couldpotentially issue is the key as youdrive into some of thiswe're talking about resiliency a lotI think most of everyone here most willknow that backups are necessary but howoften have you tested your backuphow often are you practicing resiliencyin terms ofbacking up your entire system makingsure that it's available enough anddriving towards testing the backupsystem and seeing what's missingdo you have the right team members thatunderstand the infrastructure to backyou upand where are you backing up from if youlose your entire service layer likeScott mentioned earlier on in terms ofif you're in gcp or you're runningsomewhere else and then you're backingfrom one area to another so resiliencyis a key piece to understanding howyou're able togo by and then making sure that you haveright recovery capability as you runinto your security programone of the key things that we've lookedat as well is as we do all of thisthere's a fundamental key thing thatevery security company should look at isidentity and the identity I call it isthe core and it is the glue foreverything that we do we have somethingin ukg we're saying that we're usingidentity as a service but identity interms of our identity securityoperations identity in the sock driveseverything that we doif you don't know who's accessing yourenvironment if you can't tell whatthey're doing if you don't have contactseverything else you do is just guessinggameso understanding the rightidentity for your environment for theusers logging in internal is key butalso monitoring those making sure thatyou have the right context when you movethis to the customer is talking abouthow do you really make sure you enhancethe customer capability how do you givethem the right model we're talking aboutpasswordless there's a lot of thingsthat's going out there but how do youmake so it's easy for the customers toleverage your identity and theiridentity to be able to work togetherefficiently and then drive better secureinfrastructurelastly everything we dowe have to have some sort of riskmanagement around it which meansdecision making right there's a lot ofwork that we have to do so you got topick and choose the most critical andStat with it more importantly we need tobe able to have the right controls andcompliance around that if you run in theUS and you run in in the EU you have tohave the right capability you have tohave the right compliance and regulatoryrequirements to drive that but theimportant thing is visibility thereknowing the type of regulatoryrequirements you have and how you dealwith itbut where you host your data matters aswellso choosing the right service providerchoosing the like cloud provider giveyou a little bit Edge into how you drivethatwith that said I'll just say thank youeveryone for listening today and thenI'll bring back the crew for some q a[Applause]we have any questions we're happy toanswerand also as a reminder please feel freeto also rate The Talk todaythere's a question therethere's a little bit of there's a micthere I could hear youyou talked about the tools andstrategies for to help with resiliencyis anywhere we can any point as you cangive ustools and strategies to help theresiliency yeahyeahyesso um so the to talk about strategiesunderstanding what data is important toyou what's critical so what's thecritical application or critical systemthat you need to make sure that yourecover on a timely manner so you needto understand that uh location where isit located right where is that data awaysitting and how do you get to it do youhave a strategy to back it up and whattype of strategies do you have tacticalcontrols do you have to actually restorefrom one place to another uh so you'retalking about backup you're talkingabout system risk restoration or you'retalking about full snapshot so those arethe key things that you look at in eacharea but then location right if youbacking up in the same infrastructurewhere your primary data is then maybeyou should think about what happened ifI lose my entire infrastructure do youhave somewhere else that you're actuallybacking up data that is isolated fromyour environment in the event that youhave your primary environment go downthat's one number two is the networkingpiece to it once that is down how do youbring that down to a new infrastructureor if you have to rebuild an entirestack where can you do that is thatautomated does it take a day four hoursor two days those are the strategies youshould have documented and tested toallow you to move faster and quicklyforeign"
