Cynthia Wu who's theproduct manager for carbon footprintAlejandro Montenegrowho's a customer engineer based out ofDenmark and lastly I guess star speakerMichael sudakovich who is a staffsecurity engineer at Uberthank you coolthank youso what do you learn todayum I will start the session today withunderstanding green Ops later Cynthiawill cover how we can actually measureyour carbon impact and then Alejandrowill cover optimizing your workloads forcarbon efficiencyand then Mike sorry then Michael willshare with us Uber's success journey tobecoming a leader in Cloudsustainabilitywe hope you find the session todayuseful and you will learn todaydifferent tools and strategies and leaveempowered to take action in yourorganizationscool so let's get started with the firstsection of today's uh session which isunderstanding greenupsthis is a pivotal decade in the fightagainst climate change there seem to bemore natural disasters happening if notif on weekly if not on daily basissuch as wildfires and also extreme heatfor exampleI'm from London and how this isimpacting our day-to-day lives last yearin July 2022 we had extreme heat I meanfor London it was very hot and it causeda damage to one of the collocationservices that that took down a bunch oflike holes and outage that I took downmuch of Business Servicesand as a result there's been a researchdone where we've seen where consumersinvestors and also business law changingtheir behaviorfirstlyconsumerswe've seen in the research 79 of thepolled consumers have shown interest avery strong preference to choose brandsthat are more sustainablesecondlymore and more Investments are flowing tobusinesses that have an environmentalpurposeas an example of BlackRock the largestasset managerhas put sustainability into theportfolio construction and is exitingessentially companies that possess Highsustainability riskand lastly thousands of companies havesaid targets and goals and have aroadmap in place to be more sustainableand this is what Google is doing in thespace Google has been long committed tosustainability and we have worked reallyhard to make sure that our data centersare one of the most efficient right nowin the marketand we are the first company of our sizeto have achieved carbon neutrality in2007.and 100 renewable energy matching since2017 on a global and annual basisbut we are not stopping therewe set much more ambitious goal therewill be carbon free 24 7 by 2030.at every hour and at every locationso when you use Google Cloud know thatwe have worked really hard to make surethat we minimize our impact so when youuse our products and services by defaultyou are on the sustainability Journeywith usand you can do always more on top whichis later when Michael will coverum on what Uber has donedeveloper why should youcarry here today right how does thisrelate to youum with data centers around consumingaround one percent of the world'selectricityum your approach to building yourapplication really mattersum you can make decisions that betterfor your business and for the planet andyou can also give your teams platformsthat already have sustainability builtinthe previous research that I mentionedactually has shown that 89 of Engineerswould choose to move to a Greenerlocation a region if they were presentto the choicebut besides moving regions what are theother choices that we can make todayright and let's talk about thatsustainability Journey on gcpwhen we spoke to customers and you knowdiscovered we discovered there are twomain pathswinning of I.T and Greening by I.TGreening of I.T means reducing theimmediate impact of your I.T operationsand lowering Associated emissionsGreening by it is using Cloudinnervation to reimagine Solutions andbusiness models to be more sustainableand green Ops falls under the firstGreening of itand that's what we'll be covering todayin the sessionwhat is green Ops how many of you haveheard of this term beforecouple of hands I see good so for thosewho don't know who haven't heard of thisterm before green Ops is an approach forcarbon aware engineering and operationsculture targeted at Developersgreenups consists of three maincomponents understand measure andoptimize in the first section we try toexplain you the principles of greensoftware engineering then we move on tothe measured part which explains you thedifferent tools and resources thatavailable to you today that can measureyour carbon impact and lastly optimizethe different strategies that you canuse to reduce your emissionslet's start with the first section ofgreen Ops which is understandum I'm gonna cover now very high levellandscape of Journey from electricityconsumption to output and latest Cynthiawill actually share more in detail inthis sectionso running any kind of workloadsum as you may guess requires electricityright and this electricity comes fromthe grid which often is which often usesfossil fuel power plantsum and from the renewable energydirectly procured by the userand this energy then flows through theelectric gridand then it Powers your you know homesoffices this this conference and ourdata centers which then power yourworkloadssonot every grid as I mentioned in theearly slide is equal and why do I saythatfor example if you look at this map yousee that I mean you don't see on thismap but France it relies heavily onnuclearthen Sweden relies heavily on hydroand that's why you see a bit of Greenersection in Sweden and then for exampleTexas relies on natural gas what doesthis meanum you knoweven with particular Regional grid theychooseas what the reason why I say it's notequal is because for example during theday the grade may be using solar rightbut in the evening it will not becausethe sun isn't outum and on top of thatoopsand on top of that Google has beenuncoaching to procureum your renewable energy to reduce ourenvironmental impact about data centersand we publish that data in the linkbelow so you can have a look at the linklater after the sessionand the first thing you can do todayum is to look at the link and the mapand figure out where do you have yourworkloads today and how could the impactchange if it was moved to a differentregionand now I'm going to pass it over toCynthia who's going to take you on theJourney of measuring carbon impactI'll take you through the tools fromGoogle that you can use to help youmeasure and reduce your Cloud carbonimpactso we've heard from a lot of customersthat it is really complex to estimatecarbon emissions at a granular levelespecially for cloud workloads with moreand more Google Cloud customers like youall sitting here embark on thesustainability journey to addressclimate change it has been increasinglyimportant to get to a granular level ofunderstanding of your carbon emissionsso that you can act on themand that is why we've built the tools atGoogle to help you report onand reduce your company's carbonfootprint before I go into a live demoof those tools let's quick uh take aquick peek into our tools and how webuilt themfirst on Google Cloud carbon footprintit is a tool you can find in the cloudconsoleand we have granular level breakdown byservice project gcp region also by theScopes according to the greenhouse gasprotocolyou can also export it to bigquery andintegrate it with looker and sheets sothat you can do your own customizedanalysiswe also have a dedicated IEM role to uhto to give you more SEC secure accesscontroland our methodology has been reviewedaccording to the greenhouse gas protocolfurthermore we have started to harnessthe power of AI to give yourecommendations on how to reduce yourcarbon emissions you see the numbers andour integration for now has been theunattended project recommender throughactiveassist and I will demo that veryshortlymoving on uh Google workspace has alsorecently just launched its carbonfootprint I'm really excited to announcethat here and welcome you to Twilight ifyou're a workspace user you can find itin the admin consoleand similar to the gcp tool it has scopebreakdowns as well asservice level breakdowns on a monthlybasis and the methodology has also beensimilarly reviewedand you might ask it's great that you'llprovide me with the tools but how didyou arrive those numbers and how can Itrust them so let me take you throughour bottom up a methodology on how toestimate those emissions for you andI'll start from the electricityconsumption part which is also calledscope 2 according to the greenhouse gasprotocolso let's imagine this is a Google datacenterand your workloads run on Google Googledata center servers right and we have alot a lot of a lot of servers in ourdata centers and we also track energyconsumption per service on the Machinelevel and that is the foundation of youknow the granular details you'll see inour reportsso all of these represent the activecompute resources and on top of that wereserve you know additional capacitiesas adult resources to help you scale upor down easily in Google Cloudand that's not all of everything thatconsumes energy there's also you knowancillary facilities and overhead in ourdata centers for example lighting andair conditioning and all of theseconsume energy and where did the energycome fromand as Kula mentioned it's from theelectricity grid and also the additionalrenewable energy that Google procuresso with this understandingto construct your you know yourcustomers scope to emissionswe take the energy the Machine levelenergy consumption numbercoupled with the power usageEffectiveness number which isessentially telling you how efficientour data centers are and by the wayGoogle data centers are some of the mostefficient around the world and wepublish our Pue numbers by location bydata center every year and we welcomeyou to check out that numberand we combine that with the carbonintensity for the specific grid thateach specific data center sits on rightso you understand that as coulombmentioned different locations actuallyyou know for the same workload mayactually translate into vastly differentcarbon carbon intensity and carbonimpactand then we combine that with servicelevel breakdown and and then we combineit with your customer specific billingaccount level usage data and then all ofthat you know goes into your report andgives you the granular level ofunderstanding of the carbon emissionsand one question I get from a lot ofcustomers is why don't some of my carbonreport doesn't match exactly my bill itis because you know we use the actualusage number to factor into our into ouraccounting not your bill the actualdollar amount because you know for somecustomers you might get a discount fromGoogle services but the carbon that'sactually put into the atmosphere that'simpacting the environment shouldn't geta discount and that's how we'rereflecting it hereand Beyond scope two you know fromelectricity which I just walked youthrough there are two other Scopes thatwe also share the numbers in our reportsthere's scope one in scope three soscope one in the context of Google datacenter is the the emissions from usingon-site backup diesel generatorsand scope 3 is a broader categorycapturing from the Google data centerperspective capturing the manufacturingand the transportation of the serversand the racks into our data centers aswell as building our data centersso we give we give all three scopes ofthe data to you and our reports and whenyou use our reports all three of theseScopes should factor into yourorganization scope 3 databecause Google is you know just one ofthe suppliers of your organizationall right andum with that I will go into a live demoto take you through our toolsall right greatso this is the Google Cloud carbonfootprint tool you can find it in theGoogle Cloud console by searching forcarbon footprintor you can find it in the left leftnavigation panel on a carbon footprintherewhen you arrive at this page you'll seethat we have published our detailedmethodologywhich is here and feel free to check itout um you know I kind of walked youthrough briefly how we arrived at it butthere's so much more details to it andif you're interested this is a fantasticresource for youand here at the top you see two summarycards we have an annual carbon footprintsummary with scope one two three levelbreakdown and we also have the monthlysummary card in the Middle with a trendchart with a month month over a monthtrendsand scrolling down you see we havemonthly Trend breakdown as well asbreakdown by gcp projectgcp region where the workloads are andthe gcp products let us compute enginenetworking or Cloud loggingall right and if you want to get anunderstanding of the data behind thisall of these charts you can set up anexport and Export this into bigqueryand I will show you the exported data sothis is the sample of the exported datain bigquery and you'll see we havemonthly level and billing account leveldata by projectby gcp serviceby locationand then with all the Scopes breakdownthat you see so you can use this data tocustomize your analysis and dive into alot of details that's not showing up inthe UI and you might be able to uncovereven more loversible to help optimizeyour Cloud for sustainabilityandhere on the last last but not least onthe right hand side you see therecommendations card and this is theintegration with the machine learningpowered active assist unattended projectrecommender and you see we haveidentified potential projects that arelikely idle or maybe you forgot aboutand we have recommended actions herewith an estimated cost and carbonsavings if you take those actionsand moving on to the Google workspacetool so you can find this tool in theadmin console of Google workspace Underreportingyou'll see this is a new tag herebecause it's recently launched similarto the gcp tool you have the totalcarbon footprint here and monthly costsummary in the middle here and there'salso scope breakdownsif you're new to carbon accounting wewelcome you to check out this quickstart video to familiarize yourselveswith the carbon accounting Conceptsand there's also charts break down bydifferent months and you know breakdownby Services as you can tell Drive dogssheets and slides are the maincontributor to the emissions of thisparticular user followed by Gmail andsome other servicesthere's also a more granular breakdownherewith custom date range that you canchoose fromso and can we switch back to the thepresentation so with that hopefully nowyou have a good understanding of how weestimated the the carbon emissions inour tools and how you can use thosetools to measure your carbon impact andI'll pass it on to Alejandrotowalk you through more of the strategieson optimizing for carbonthank you CynthiaI'm Alejandro I'm a customer engineerbased out of coping Denverso we just saw how you can easily get anunderstanding and actually measure thecarbon fitprint generated by your GoogleCloud resourcesnow with this understanding ideally whatyou want to do is try to optimize thecloud usage to reduce the carbonfootprintand this is what we have been doing overthe last couple of years with several ofcompanies that we work with helping toidentify different optimizationstrategies that then can apply and thatfits intotheir reality and that kind of work lossso let's have a look into thatwrong buttonthere we goso as I mentioned beforewe have identified some optimizationstrategies that in general helps youreduce your carbon footprint and ingeneral have to do with actuallyreducing the way you use your GoogleCloud resourceswhich has a side benefit that itactually also reduce your cost which isquite nice at least for most of thecompanies that we work withsay that we do have identified someoptimization strategy to do the oppositesoincreasing your cost in favor ofreducing your carbon footprint thinkabout you want to move a workload fromone region to a Greener region and youdo that but The Greener region is moreexpensive to run that specific workloadso have that into consideration when youlook into which kind of optimizationstrategies you want to use on the slideI have listed 12 different optimizationstrategy that we have found that workswell for most of the companies and atthe top you have the easiest one toimplement like cleanup archiving regionoptimization and using new CPUarchitecture down to the bottom whereyou have the most complex one likeoptimizing machine learning training anddoing distributed infrarated machinelearning today I will not be able tolook into all of those but I have pickeda few that we believe is the best onefor most of the organizations that wework withso in the easiest level ofimplementation effort we have createdwhat we call the carbon sense Suitewhich is a bundle of tools that helpsyou to make more informed decisionsthe first one is the low carbon regionsignal which is basically uh within theGoogle Cloud Web console when you createa new resource we indicate to you whereis the best region to run the specificresource in respect to carbon footprintas you can see in the sample handsay that we understand that noteverybody can migrate the workloads toFinlandor Belgium especially if you are basedout of San Francisco and your custombase is in the U.S probably won't maketoo much sense have all your workloadsin Europeso we have created a tool that we callthe regional picker the original paperis basically a tool that based oncertain criterias will give you a listof recommended regions that fits to yourneedswhat are those criterias country wherethe traffic is coming fromwhat are you optimizing for is it costlatency carbon footprint and you cangive weight into all those parametersonce you do that the tool wouldbasically give you a list of region thatyou can use that tailored for your needshaving that understanding you can applyorganization-wide policies so you canactually limit your users or restrictthem to only use those regions that wehave identifiedby that way you ensure that actually theright regions that choose from a carbonprint point of viewand finally we have active assist asCenter management we are continuouslyadding more tools within that to helpyou identify those resources that arerunning for our Island and that youprobably should consider removing overthe last 30 60 or 90 daysso in a medium level of effort we havewhat we call scaling resources and thisis basically the idea of taking realadvantage of the real-time elasticity ofcloudyou would say well if I'm building anapplication for from scratch this is ano-brainer as I'm probably applying thecloud native patterns but we work withmany companies that come from an on-premworld and are moving into cloud andnormally move the workload as isand don't really think about this ideaof elasticity when it comes to carbonfootprint so our recommendation is lookinto your workloads identify those thatare running 24 7. and don't need to dothatlow hanging fruit are normallyDev environment test environment thatcould run 5x9once you have identified those you cancreate a Skilling mechanisms youautomatically turn them off and turnthem on you can use the Google Cloudscalar that calls a function and thatfunction triggered the API that actuallywould turn it off or turn it onor even you could add a use a portal sothey could go in and do it manually bythemselves so whenever a user need aservice to turn it on afterwards turn itonwhat we did figure out that many timeswe see companies that many users usingthe same service so we recommend youhave a monitor if somebody is trying toturn an offer service and that servicestill being used you can use thatmonitor to delay the shutdown and waitfor the user to be finished to thatnow this is good if you want to keep theapplication as is as you migratedideally what you want to do is try torefactor the applicationto make it more Cloud native so you canleverage and make use of our managedservicesfor example if it's a serving API youcould use cloud run or the DK autopilotif it's a data processing job you canuse that product data flowand then into what we call little blackbelt or the most complex one has to dowith optimizing your machine learningso you heard today and you are heard inthe news a lot around large languagemodels and the potential benefits thatthey can have put in your organizationbut that's also another discussion howhow much those and especially thetraining of those actually impact theenvironmentso this is also a key topic to discussso what we recommend ishave a look into those existing modelsthat are on Google cloud and see if youcan take advantage of those andcustomize them for your specific need soyou don't have the need to train a modelfrom scratchso over the last couple of years we havedeveloped techniques that allows you totake what we today call a foundationmodel and enhance that or customize thatfor your specific needsnow we used to call that automl today wehave created what we call model Gardenso we are not only exposing Googlemodels but we're also exposing theirthird-party models that you can takeadvantage ofonce you decide if you want to go frombuilding a model from scratch or addingan Adaptive layer what you can do isdecide where you will do the training soit's a different thing of doing thetraining of the model to deploy andserve the model so you can decide toactuallytrain them all in one of our greenestregion let's say Finland and once thathas been trained actually deployed onany other region all over the worldanother consideration is as we're seeingmore and more adoption within theorganization of machine learning we areseeing the lack of having asingle repository where everybody can goin and discover what our teams are doingso we highly recommend have a repositoryfor those malls with the metadata withthe data that have been trained withwith the version and the feature sets soanybody within the organization candiscolor those models and make aninformed decision can I make use of anexisting model within our organizationor do I actually have to train one fromscratchyou can also or we highly recommend youto take advantage of the acceleratorboth GPU and CPU early in April welaunched the TPU version 4 which wedeployed in a huge Hub in Oklahoma andin Oklahoma it's run on 90 carbon freeenergyand again the final final recommendationwould be take advantage of those managedservices that we're using uh offeringwithin Google Cloudthe the idea of you managing theunderlying infrastructure creating VMaccessing accelerator updating the driveand so on can be a hero let Google dothat for you and we will optimize theamount of resources assigned to yourtrainersothe question I get most often is okayhow do we get started and the answer isnormally well it depends it depends onyour reality what are your type ofworkloads what are you optimizing forhow is it impacting in your cost how isit impacting in your actual carbonfootprint what we do recommend have alook at those 12 optimization strategiesthat we have identified look into whichone fits into what you're looking forimplementedmeasure with the carbon footprintdashboard get the feedback understandwas it valuable to do thatimplementation if yes do more of that ifnot don't into another optimizationstrategy but again I would say how toget started and what is the journey youshould follow is unique for each one ofthe reality of your organization and forthat reason we invited Michael over totell us about Uber and this journey ofoptimizing for their footprintO2 microthank you thanks Alejandro uh hi folksmy name is Michael sudakovic I'm asecurity engineer at tuber I also leadthe sustainability engineering team nowI mentioned security is actually aninteresting overlap a small overlapbetween security and sustainabilitywe'll get to it in a few slidessobefore we get started just a bit of abird's eye view on you knowsustainability efforts at Uber right soum we have some uh interesting greenofferings right when you uh choose yourright my right of choice is usually Ubergreen matches you with a uh low emissioncar electric or um or a hybrid we alsodo two wheels bikes and scooters uhuberX share uh but when it comes toubereats we're also working on reducingthe packaging or the unsustainablepackaging right and moving to the moresustainable Packagingwe're helping drivers to go electric aswell investing money there and we havetransparency on our accountability andprogress so some of our goals here for2030 uh and that's just just what sixseven years from now right we want allof the rides in Canada Europe and theUnited States be zero emission by 2040it's uh Global right we want to beGlobal uh as well as emissions fromdeliveries from ubereats and and suchuh Net Zero climate emissions from allcorporate operations by 2030 and by 2040from all of the Scopes right as Googlementioned Scopes one two and threeso let's go let's get to the uhengineering sustainability part rightum so our goal really is we want tooptimize for sustainability and we wantthis optimization to be effortlessseamless and obvious now the way weapproach it is by looking at it in asfour steps or four verticals RightMoving from the most manual approach toall the way all to automatedso on the manual side right we have whatwe call a wear and act so this is wherewe want to invest in training in inmaking sure employees Engineersdevelopers PMS they know what needs tobe done right they're aware of the toolsthey're aware of the best practiceswe'll go over some examples in a bit thesecond step is what we call a systemdevelopment so this is where we come upwith automation to providerecommendations we tell the owners theservice owners that this is what youshould probably be doing in order tooptimizethird step is essentially removing thehuman from the process right wegenerally want as leader Reliance onhumans in in the process if you canautomate completely then we want to dothat and again we'll see some examplesand then finally the fourth step issustainability by default right when wecreate the resources by default we wantthem all ready to be optimized forsustainabilityso with that let's move and see someexamples of the firststep the aware and actso uh we saw earlier some of the toolsthat Google provides such as the carbonfootprint dashboardand the activist that allow us to comeup with metrics right without metrics wecan't really make informed gooddecisions so we use that in order toshow the resource owners the trendsright and the metrics and see where theyare see where they want to be see wherethe resources that create the most CO2emissions are located Etc now with thisMatrix we can then go and startoptimizing at first manually right sothat's on the bottom side here so firstregion selection so we've heard fromcoulon uh we've heard of Alejandro andCynthia right that the where matterswhere you deploy your resources mattersmatters quite significantly right whenyou look at the comparison so we wantEngineers to be aware that regionselection matters in addition to othercriteria such as maybe latency costright sustainability is there toonext is maximizing utilization so weoften over provision resources when welook at is right and VM Supply provisionsometimes there's two large disks or twolarge VMS with too much memory allocatedright and we don't necessarily need allof that so we want Engineers to take alook and see can we maximize utilizationor can we scaled down these videosdeduplication what is deduplicationsometimes we store unnecessarily copiesof data or of compute do we really needall these versions right more data morestorage of course needs more electricitymore energyimproving code efficiency what does thathave to do here right so you know incomputer science we learn aboutcomplexity right time complexity spacecomplexity so it's interesting that theless time it takes for a program code torun right the less compute is used theless space it takes again the lessenergy is used so we want to optimizecomplexity Cod efficiency also becauseit improves sustainability so maybe youknow take another look at those codereviews right and encourage Engineers todo what they do bestall right shared Faith this is a termthat comes often in the security fieldwe shared Faith with the cloud providerwhen it comes to security and there'ssplitum uh differences of what cloud provideris responsible for versus the developersnow it also comes in place when we talkabout sustainability musicians becausewe can use the managed offerings fromthe cloud and let the cloud optimize forus so we're going to talk about servicesoftware as a service right we'll talkabout serverless right we try to usethese as much as possible to let thecloud providers optimize for ussetting upper limits on scaling andbudget right and alerts as well so wewant to make sure that service ownersare aware when their services scale upunnecessarily potentially unnecessarilyright and get an alert that might happenbecause of auh maybe a DDOS attack might be becausewe didn'tcreate all the resources that we need soit might be beneficial for us to take alook and see if there's a way tooptimize there for us to not scale up orscale outwards unnecessarily so theseare just some of the practices that wewant Engineers to be aware ofnow the Second Step some example oneexample that I'll bring here this is theassisted development right this is whereautomation is in place to helpdevelopers one example is looking atprojects and we want to look at projectlife cycles we see on the left side herethere's four different states where wesometimes or often see our projects inthe green we see project is used andowned used you know self-explanatory ohand there's an active owner assigned tothat project this is where we want to bewe want to have an active owner and wewant the project to be actively usedin the red right the bottom right unusedand orphan so no owner maybe they moveto a different team if they left thecompany and not used in this case wemight want to eliminate this projectright carefully right first we mightwant to stop remove the permissions andthen start start blocking somefunctionalities and then delete thisproject uh at allnow on the left bottom side used anorphaned right so in this case we justwant to assign a new owner to thisproject but this is the interesting casenow on the right upper side we have anowner and the project is not usedthis happens when you know owners justforget about projects maybe they createdit for a POC and they just let it leftit running again unnecessarily consumingenergy creating CO2 emissions costing usmoneyso for that we created automation tocreate a jira ticket or a service nowticket on the right side here and assignit to the project owner and say hey thisis how much cost your project consumesthis is how much CO2 emissions yourproject is responsible of take a lookmaybe you want to delete it right so howdid we build thisso we can see the architecture on theright side here it's pretty so simple acloud scheduler through Pub sub callsCloud functions these Cloud functionslook at each projecttalk to activists remember we mentionedactive assist earlier through an APIcall and use activities to serve assource of truth that tells us whether aproject is used or not used we also lookat Cost through the billing API we lookwe get our data on the CO2 emissions andwe use all that to store in firestoreand to send through Pub sub to send itto jira servicenow in the formula oftickets to the service owners I can alsovisualize it through bigquery and dataStudioand this is where by the way thesecurity comes in place as well rightthere's a benefit to security byreducing the attack surface if youremove unnecessary services andresources you reduce the opportunitiesfor end for a potential attacker toexploit themall right now third step the automationright this is where we want to removethe human from the process so oneexample here is looking at the computeagain we can take a look at activeassist for recommendations will we seesometimes that compute resources areprovisioned unnecessarily and they'rejust running doing nothing right ormaybe they have disks attached to themthat are never used so in that case wecan automaticallystop these VMS without necessarily needto delete them we can just stop it andsend a ticket or a slack message to theresource owner saying hey we stop it foryou take a look maybe you want to deleteitso we need to tread carefully herebecause in some cases rarely in somecasesresource owners do still need theseresources so they can decide okay finejust I'll just resume right I'll justresume this Viewand let's get to the final uh Targetright sustainability by default soduring provisioning we already talkedabout region the importance of regionsso we use ISC such as terraform tocreate resources create gcp projects forus when the uh when the service ownersneed them nowwe mentioned that different regions havedifferent sustainability metrics so whatwe want to do is by default wepre-select on the left side here see wepre-select the four regions that are themost sustainable in differentgeographiesthe other ones are not selected peoplecan still select them they just need toprovide the justification right why dowe need a different region but bydefault we want to encourage using themost sustainable regions to deployresourcesAnd We Gather this data from the rightside through the region picker as we sawearlier right We Gather thissustainability data and update our formuh automaticallyso uh with that I'll pass it on to colonfor summarymuch for joining the session today wehope that you learned today newresources and tools they can take awayto change how you work in yourorganizationsforeign"
