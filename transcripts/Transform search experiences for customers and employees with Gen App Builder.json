    "transcript": "foreign[Music]just to kind of set the stage you knowwe're going to have this conversation intwo parts I'm going to be talking aboutthe productEnterprise search that we launched uhand which is GA as of today and thenfollowed by that we'll have our panelisthere with Eva to talk about the searchuse cases and how they're using thisEnterprise search in their day-to-daybusinessso my name is Sachin and I amthe director of product for Enterprisesearch offering at Google Cloudexcited to talk to you about you knowwhat we are doing in this space ofEnterprise search when you really lookat it you know for a long timecustomers were used to Google and theywere like hey why can't I get thatGoogle kind of experience either on myown website that I or the apps I have orfor my own internal employee andknowledge sharing right and contentmanagement so we had this question for along time around how do you how do youprovide this Google Search experience toEnterprise customers and that's themission where we started of providingaccess to information whether it's yourown website digital Properties or ourown internal employees and other searchplaces and that's got accelerated withthe introduction of what's happening inlarge language model and foundationalmodels so you have launched a platformand I'll go a little bit uh deeper intoit on the product side where we haveEnterprise search capabilities which canhave capabilities like natural languagesright where it's not only keyword basedbut the same queries that you ask ongoogle.com you can use it either in aninternal search spaces or you can use iton your customer facing websites we haveintroduced new models for summarizationswith citation and this morning you sawkind of an experience of that if youwere in the keynote where uh you knowninshad talked about finding andrenewing your license on DMV websitewhere you kind of saw the summarizationof the answers and then also thecitation of all the links that wentthrough it right obviously there's afollow-up so we have worked on kind ofkeeping the state of the conversationbetween two queries and you can havemore of a conversational experience aspart of that searchso that's where search is going so whenyou really start with you knowuhuh one secokay the formatting of the slide looks alittle different but when we started onthis we started thinking about who arewe building this search for are webuilding it for the developers are webuilding it for the practitioners of AIand data and one thing we realized waswe wanted to kind of build a platformwhich cansatisfy the needs of folks on thedeveloper side who really want to buildan out-of-the-box experience where itcan plug and playand you know I'll get a search API thatI can call and it will manage everythingfor me from data ingestion to indexingto giving me the results on the otherhand we are do understand Enterpriseshave some complicated use cases whenthey want to build their own searchexperiences maybe they want a vectorsearch they want to have their ownembeddings and all other things so howdo we start building a platform whichcaters to the needs of both Enterpriseswith Advanced analytics folks who wantmore of a platform components as well asEnterprise developers who really want tofocus on building and getting an APIwhich is more out of the box solutionand which is most of a managed serviceso that we have built this platform withtaking these two personas in the minddevelopers and AI practitioners I'mproviding enough of tuning andcustomization so folks can move fromleft to right or right to left so thatwas the vision of how we started andbuilding this platform these twopersonas in terms of the use cases thatwe are really solving for we're solvingfor primarily two use casesboth customer facing search as well asand internal employee searchtraditionally when you think aboutEnterprise search you always I thinkit's associated with internal employeesearch but in this case we are using anexpansive meaning of Enterprise searchwhich is surge that's required by anEnterprise doesn't matter whether it'sexternal customer facing or internalinternal employee facing searchand we'll go a little detail into kindof like what are the use cases we areseeing for search today uh in terms ofthe use cases right primarily when wethink about the use cases that are weare serving on the external use caseit's the public website searchwhich is what the example of DMV was inthis morning where it's easy for you tocreate a Google kind of experience onyour own individual websites withincouple of minutes literally give us theURL of what you want to build we'llcrawl it we'll keep uh we'll index itand search API will be ready and thenyou can you know enable search on yourown website uh and it's available in asingle turn multi-turn different kind ofabilities it has its own llmcapabilities that are built in as wellthe second part of customer facingsearch are really around catalog searchright in catalog we have differentversions of the product one is where youcan actually bring any catalog you knowthere's no schema enforcement you get toDefine your own schema you get to Defineyour own decks and we'll make a searchavailable for more of a structuredcatalog on the other flavor of catalogis where we have specialized searchesthat we have built whether it's a retailsearch a lot of big retailers acrossacross the globe are actually usingGoogle retail search today where youknow you bring in your retail catalogand will enable search on top of it andthat search will be optimized for eitheryou know Revenue per visitor or somekind of Matrixso that's another use case that we havebeen serving and these are just not thefour use cases there are many more usecases but these are just a high leveluse cases Eva and the team later on frommayo and World Bank will kind of getinto the details of different use casesthey are seeing from an internal workersearch you know really kind of the twoflavors that I wanted to highlight hereat high level is around a documentsearchso this is how do I have thisinformation spread in you know multiplePDFs and documents across and each timeI have to get an answer for something Ihave to open this maybe I have 10versions of this Dock and five versionsof these slides how do I get somethingthat helps me get information from allof these and somebody summarizes me thisinformation across right so that's thedocument search that we are seeing andwe have enabled as part of our platformand later on the panelists will talk alittle bit about what they are usingthis for in terms of documents we areseeing this interest from across a widevariety of Industries in terms of thelast bucket which is more about yourtraditional intranet search right whichis around here I have a I have a bunchof documents which are behind arestricted site and I need access tothis and I almost want a Google kind ofexperience where all of my informationand content is available for knowledgeDiscovery and this is where we areenabling our intranet search where youknow you can use this search to reallygo across uh whether it's a Googleworkspace or other productivity toolsand other documents to get a searchenableduh we already had a product in thisspace it was called Google Cloud searchit was part of our workspace solutionSuite we are taking it over and we areporting it over as part of EnterpriseSearch application you'll see startseeing a lot more capabilities on thatproduct we've already had that productalready has capabilities on Ackle whichis required identity management and abunch of things but you'll start seeingmore capabilities like multi-turn searchsummarization with citations and othercapabilities that will happen on thisproductso in terms ofuhyou know the vision of where we reallywant to go and this just talks about youknow the ninja example that we had inthe keynote this morning we reallywantedEnterprises is an easy way to buildsearch and get Google quality resultsand that has been our number one goalhow can every digital property in theworld and every organization in theworld get access to their informationas they have come to expect from theirdaily experiences on google.comthe second thing that we really wantedto focus was on how do we get groundground our search results in ourEnterprise Corpus right we want to givethe flexibility for Enterprise customersto Define what that Corpus looks likeand they can decide to be restrictive ontheir own Corpus or be a little moreexpansive with maybe you know uhrelated Affiliated data sources thatthey trust so we wanted to give thiskind of control back to Enterprises ofmaking sure that they have theirinformation and control over the datasourcesthe other things we really wanted tofocus was ongiving proper access controls this isvery important for Enterprises thatcertain visibility is only available tocertain people and that's been one ofthe important features as part of ourEnterprise search that your managershould be able to see some informationthat you as an employee may not be privyto or not allowed to a important part ofbuilding any kind of search in thesystem is dataand especially for an internal employeesearch or other places where you've gotto index across a multiple sources ofinformation we wanted to build an easyexperience and that's where you knowtoday we'll get a little bit more intothe details of what data sources areavailable but we are we are activelyincorporating a large amount of datasources where it will be easy whereplugins will be available and connectorswill be available to bring in data frommultilued of Legacy systems as well asSAS systems into our environment for aeasy built of searchfinally fourth thing is a lot ofexciting things are happening in thispiece of vector search and that's wherewe are rebranding and relaunching ourplatform of vector search which waspreviously called matching engine andwe'll go a little bit detail into whatwe are doing with our Vector searchapproach uh really useful as I mentionedearlier about how we think about ourplatform strategy right from out of thebox applications to Enterprisedevelopers who are from ml practitionerswho want to use the platform approachVector search is an important part ofour platform approach for folks who wantto build their own search on top of ourplatform uh finally I think one of themost important things is we wanted toprovide that customization ability rightwe understand every Enterprise isdifferent some Enterprise wants to getinto details of something some want alittle bit more abstract things so aspart of that we are providing a lot offlexibility on our platform if you knowwe are providing you confidence courseon our retrievals so you can actuallylook at this confidence course and makea summary judgment hey maybe I'm youknow as a company my threshold forconfidence score is 90 and I'm onlygoing to show results about 90 as wellas summarize them as part of theSnippets or I might say okay I'm okaywith 60 or 75 confidence score so we aregoing to turn in more give you moreinformation about the stack and then youcan make informationuseful on how you want to customize yoursearch results so that's been the visionof how do we provide you something notonly out of the box but all the way tobuilding it your own search to somewherein the middle providing you the leversand the tools and the signals likeconfidence course so you can actuallydecide how do you want to enable thatsearch experienceso that's been our Primary Vision forlaunching uh platform in terms ofroadmap you know this is not anexpansive list of things that we havelaunched up till now uh what we havelaunched is a generative search with llmcapabilities and as part of thatgenerative search we already talkedabout grounding it to your definedCorpus of data the second thing ismulti-turn conversational search whereyou're able to have a conversation andstate between searchesthe standard features like autocompletesspell checkyou know query understanding queryintent all of those are already builtinto our websites we are launching morethings on connectors and we'll talk alittle bit more about what newconnectors are coming into our space wehave configurationsthat are available where you can decidehow do you want to boost Barry otherthings and finally the most importantthing is providing you you know leversfor safety and search as well asbuilding an application which is morefocused on responsible AIin terms of I think what's exciting andwhat's coming soon and what wasannounced today was some 3p connectorsright today primarily the integrationwas done either through bigquery orGoogle Cloud Storage but we areannouncing a net connectors for some ofthe most popular ones right whether it'sSalesforce Confluence and jira and wehave a list of other connectors that theteam is building through uh just FYI theconnectors will be launched in in apreview mode not in a ga mode in thenext two weeks uh we are also announcingthe confidence scoring which is againavailable in preview mode and comingsoonuh actually it was available todayuhall the information is actually a isavailable on our site and later on youknow everybody is going to flash our URLor you can Google it where we are you'llbe able to find a lot of informationfrom our product perspective on what'suh what's available and what's not uh Iwanted to kind of highlight few thingswhich are really exciting to talk aboutuh which I'm personally getting excitedto talk about one of the things isaround adaptersuh you build a unique technology ofadapters where you can actually useSimple golden data sets of question andanswers to improve your search qualityresultsuh these might be this is just a sampleof queries you know mocked up by us sodon't look into the validity of whateverit is but as a user think about it likeyou can actually say this is my questionand this is my answer and you can sayOkay thumbs up or thumbs down we havemore of a range of scoring actually it'sone to you know zero to five scoring orminus two to two plus two scoringapproach and thenbased on the scoring that you give themodel is learning what is a good answerand what is a good summarization so thisis uh this is something that we areexcited to make it available part of anEnterprise search where you get to tunethe quality of your results based witheasy thumbs up and thumbs down approachand this adapter will be very specificfor your search result and your projectthat you have created so as a customeryou get to have an adapter that isreally tuned to your data and more thanthat like if you have five differentsearch applications within you canactually Define a different data setsfor each one of them in terms of whatadapters you want to train maybe foryour external customer facing shares youknow you have a different q a and goldendata sets for an internal it's differentand within internal you might havedifferent data sets so you can literallybuild custom adapters at each of theproject levelsthe next thing is obviously kind ofwhat's happening in the vector searchspace uh you know as I mentioned earlierwe arerebranding our matching engine and carrelaunching it as a vector search one ofthe unique thingsabout our Vector searchis our abilitytoscaleand provide that Enterprise readinessof high QPS and that has been somethingvery unique for us and very very proudit's the same Vector searchinfrastructure that powers google.com soimagine uh you know we have some of theworld's biggest customers and retailerswho are actually using this activelybecause we couldn't find that kind ofscalability and power with other Vectorsearch applications that exist in themarket today so we are excited aboutthat we are actually doing a lot ofchanges you know introducing a lot ofchanges with the product we are going togo and provide more easy documentationwe want to cut down the indexing timefrom what it exists today we want tomake it in couple of minutes this isalready a ga product so we are going tointroduce more enhancements where youknow you can start building your indexwithin few minutes as opposed to waitingfor you know a longer time we areworking on kind of changing the whole UIexperience and making that onboardingmuch easier for customers who reallywant to use our Vector search and we'veseen a lot of customers in this spaceare really kind of the AI ml practicewho are building their own search for aparticular application right where youknow it's really unique in the way it'sbeen builtso these are some of the exciting thingsthat are coming up from a roadmapperspective as well as the vision forthe product which is to serve the needsof customers doesn't matter if you are aEnterprise with a lot of data scientistsand unique skill sets and you want aplatform to build your search on oryou're more of a you know NicheEnterprise who wants an out of the boxsolution which is managed or you'resomewhere in the middle where you wantan out of the box solution but enough ofability to customize your search fordifferent applications and play to theneeds of your uh you know use cases withthat I'm going to give it over to mycolleague Eva and the panel to talkabout the use casesthank you very much Saturn use caselandscape is uh endless probably afterhearing to Sachin nude comeback andwe'll have as many use cases as peoplein that room or even more since a coupleof you will come back with a couple ofuse cases within your Enterpriseenvironmentum having said thatworking with multiple organizations overthe past months we've done we've seensome common themes andthese are just examples that you mightassociate your organization as well withthe first one is conversational Commerceand recommendations and that doesn'tlimit itself to retail only that appliesto any segmented Market where customersare now having those packaged solutionsfor them and package products but nowwith the search capabilities will beeasily able to search for additionalproducts and customize their theirportfolio of products they want toselect the other one is such an alludedto that before is document and mediasearch Enterprise search allows us toreally select andanswer specific domain questions fromthe variety of sources whether this is aPDFunstructured structure data and so onand so forth creates that Vectorrepresentation and ask specific domainwent to the model and the other aspectis a website search navigation and inthat area any Enterprise has a websiteallowing your customers to really searchthrough thatwebsite in a more efficient manner timeto resolutions of crucial value and dropoff kprs are really hitting many of ourorganizations so allowing that fasterresolution faster inside navigationthrough the website is really key andthe next aspect is market researchof the organization has some marketresearch capability capabilities andneeds so being able to drive throughsummarization through content generationthe insights that you can give to yourorganizations is of huge importance anddrives productivity improvements and thelast piece that we want to highlight isemployee assistance being able to driveproductivity improvements throughproviding the assistance to anyemployees whether this is cloud searchthat was uh that satin talked about oreven agent assist uh and kyccapabilities on any of the consumers inthe call center these are the use caseswe have been seeingand eventuallywhat does the impact of solving of thosebusiness problems and we ask ourselveshow do we measure the value of that andcustomer experiences Improvement incustomer experience is one of themwhether it's this uh net promoterscourse or other kpis that we you mightlook in your organizations productivityimprovements we alluded to that as welldriving through insights faster time toresolution and faster time to insightstend to Value provides additionalaspects process optimization that alsocomes back toallowing your users and your customersto drive the search to the transactionand completing an order or a payment andand last but not least scalabilitycompetitiveness we have seen that thoseorganizations start embraced thatinnovativeness in their environments areable to reap higher Revenue sources anddrive competitivenessbut uh before we talk too much about itI would like our guests to speak to thatand invite them on stage so the firstone isum didymia kozlowsky who is a solutionarchitect for Mayo Clinic Cloud which isa platform for established byPartnership of Mayo Clinic and Google totransform Health Care with capabilitiesof Google cloud and has more than 15years of experience in healthcare and AIwelcome on stageand the second person I would like toinvite is Ramanperumal who is a seasoned technologyindustry professional with over 20 yearsof experience working at the World Bankhe currently serves as the lead of theartificial intelligence and machinelearning platforms teams where his teamis focused on harnessing the potentialof AI to enhance the efficiency andproductivity of Frontline worldwidestaff welcome on stagethank youso we are going to start with a questionwe talked a lot about the use cases whatare the use cases that you are seeing inyour organization's while experimentingwith Enterprise Merit over the pastmonths and I will start with the Daniawell Mayo Clinic releases a number ofuse cases for Enterprise search just togive you a flavor I'll tell you aboutthree of them for our patients andvisitors we're looking at Enterprisesearch on our public website so they cantake advantage of that natural languageinteraction and The quick summarywithout having to read the searchresults for internal Mayo staff who areloading knowledge bases into Enterprisesearch like our policy documents and ourit knowledge base so you'll be able toask Enterprise search what's the dresscode when attending a conference or howdo I get access to Google Clouduh and then a third use case forclinicians and researchers is we'reloading clinical documents intoEnterprise search we have years worth offull-text documents from patient visitssurgical notes radiology and pathologyreports that really represent a wealthof knowledge but it's hard to accesswith traditional search methods andalmost prohibitively time consuming totry to read manually so we're reallyhoping that Enterprise search will letus realize the full value of that datasetand the follow-up questions immediatelyhow do you measure that valuecoping is one thing measuring what youmeasure you control well there are threeor three different ways that we measureit the first is we're really looking toprovide a joyful search experience notjust a search that gets the job done butone that's a pleasure to use andcertainly in my experiences Enterprisesearch meets that we'll also getcustomer feedback on that areathe second value add that we're tryingto get is Time Savingsthe the summary is a great feature forthat because you don't always have toread the individual search results youcan just get your answer right away andthen something like this huge data setof clinical documents being able to findthe ones that you need really quicklyeven if you then have to read them butthere's also summary features inEnterprise search for individualdocumentsthe third way we measure value is morequantitative and this is we need to besure it's giving correct answers sowe'll test Enterprise search againstknown right answers and measure thereliability and precisionor the recall and precision sorry yeahso it's truly a combination of measuringthe performance of the model and theperformance of the summarization and thebusiness metrics right that you need tolook at Roman how is that in your casewhat are the use cases and how do youmeasure the value ofimplementing those use cases sure thanksEva the World Bank I think we prideourselves in being a knowledgeinstitution so a lot of focus onanalysis so any analysis as with anyorganization it starts with a search soif you are able to provide a generatedsummaries that kind of takes us asignificant way interrupt users havingto click on Blue Links find it out forthemselves the second piece is we alsoproduce a lot of information and ifyou're able to use the outputs of searchto generate zero drafts to get our Proprocesses kick-started that was that wasanother one and it would be Priceless tohave conversations with 70 years ofknowledge and research which the WorldBank has put together not just forinternal staff but also for the publicin general so that is those are kind ofthe key use cases which we have focusedon okay and how are we measuring themeasuring of values pretty much alignedwith what they spoke about it's a lot ofmeasurements on the search performancethe quantitative metrics on Precisionrecall customer satisfaction surveyswhich go out but then for the knowledgeproducts it's going to be more towardsthe time to market the time to move fromone process stage to another because ittakes a significant amount of time andif we are able to measure and bring thattime down it brings greater value forevery dollar which the World Bankinvests in development yeah so this isexactly what we are seeing in many ofthe clients and probably you canidentify with those metrics are prettycommon independent of the industry rightand we encourage as well customers tothink about it up front before theystart launching before they start eatingthe POC uh proof of concept to reallythink about those metricsumI know we have been working for a whileso it would be interesting to hear andwhat was your experience so far and whatare the wish lists that you you have forus we always listen to our clients andtry to implement the best we canso uhI want to First say that Enterprisesearch is coming out with wonderful newfeatures every day vpcsc support forexample just came up out earlier thismonth we were very excited by that onehalf of our list for new features weresome of the ones that Sasha talked abouta little earlier we want more connectorsto ingest data from a variety of datasources so we're excited about beingable to crawl intranet resources andingest data directly from existingknowledge bases and search storesanother thing that's on our list was theuhconfidence scores we've been waiting along time for that I'll probably betesting them in the hotel room tonightyeah this has been a request indeed uhfor many of our clients we are excitedto launch it today and encourage thegroup as well to try it out yeah Ramenon your side so on the World Bank sidealso it's very similar I thinkconnectors connectors connectors becausewe have so many different enterprisesoftware which we use in different areasuh right now a significant chunk of timeis spent bringing that data andharmonizing it prepping it as Sachinpointed out getting it into either abigquery or on Google data store sohaving these connectors would greatlyhelp accelerate the value because theexpectation from staff is that they goto one place and they're able to get allthe information at one place and that issomething which would be really helpfulthe second piece which we've heard fromWorld Bank staff is an integrated viewof internal and external content becauseright now they do use the public Googlethey end up using the internal searchengines as well and they call it butwhen you're producing summaries ifyou're able to bring the power of bothgrounded on citations I think that wouldbe awesome so that'sthat's definitely something that we arelooking into implementation as wellworking into testing and with ourclients so thank you very much for thatfeedbackum and last piece I wanted to touch uponuh there is a huge difference betweenbringing uh generative Ai and AItechnology in general to Enterpriseenvironment from the b2c businesswhat are the governance structures thatneed to be in place in yourorganizations that the team here and theaudience can learn from that you'veimplemented while working with thattechnology over the past monthsso maybe I'll go first so the world theWorld Bank is kind of unique because wehave we enjoy certain privileges andimmunities as an InternationalDevelopment institution but that alsomeans that when we work with cloudservices and Cloud providers the datawhich is provided is kind of secure andseparated from the rest of the contentand that implies significant securitypolicies uh grounding of the networksand so on and so forth so that possiblyis probably the most critical piece froma governance standpoint because we donot want any of the data which isprovided to be used for the modelimprovements and stuff like that becauseit is uh kind of proprietary to the bankthe second piece is even though we enjoyprivileges and immunities we follow thedata privacy policies so there isinternal World Bank personal data usepolicy and that again implies that usageof data how's the data stored how is itused how is it going to be used in thefuture those all become extremelycritical from a governance standpoint[Music]what do you agree is soyeah we really have remarkably similarconcerns to the World Bank for MayoClinic the privacy and security of ourpatient data is Paramount so any datathat we're putting in the cloud we'relooking for the services to be HIPAAcompliant covered under our businessassociate agreement we want all dataprotected by both user identitymanagement so Google Cloud IAM and alsonetworking controls virtual privateCloud we're also looking for fullauditing and traceability on any datathat we load in the cloud more specificto generative AI it's really importantthat any data that's input into themodel as prompts or as user questionsdoesn't feed the training of the publicmodel that that stays private and all ofGoogle's generative AI features meetthat criteria yeah we very much stick tothat notion that anything whether it's aprompt the training data or even modeloutput these are or IP of the customerand we wouldn't use that in training ourmodels so I hope this is an explicit andI think this is a requirement not onlyfor us but for any technologyorganization so that leads me to thelast topic of today's talk thank youvery much for being with us today thatwas well very valuable to the topic ofto the topic of Enterprise Readiness asmentioned before b2c and B2B are trulyI don't want to say different businessesbut uh I think there is a high bar formaking generative AI in particularEnterprise ready and uh that becomeseven harder uh in the era of generativeAi and why the reason is that the accessto the technology is being democratizedthere are more animal peoplecapabilities are getting out of the boxin the pastmachine learning engineers and datascientists had only an exclusive accessto that technology today it's not thecase today people need to learn how toprompt and sometimes they don't need tolearn how to train the model to use AItechnology so the set of opportunitiesis larger but at the same time the setof risks is also largerumso what are the critical aspects thatwe've seen in Enterprise environment thefirst one is control over IP and as Iwas mentioned before anythingum that is prompt training data or modeloutput is truly your data and yourprotected IP the second aspect isgrounding in factuality and that's theunique risk of generative AIum grounding and providing and avoidinghallucinations is of importance thatmight cause the reputation of theorganization if that's not adhered toand we are providing those groundingcapabilities on your Corpus of the datathe other aspect is easy access toresponsible AI tooling and I will talkbriefly about it in laterthis is not only about talking I want tobe responsible this is really inoperationalizing that and givingEnterprises the real tooling to makethat happenand the last piece is data governanceSafety and Securitywithin the cloud that is guaranteed asas with all our products on gcpso how are we approaching that from theuhum Enterprise search perspective firstany of our products that we arereleasing and we are releasing into GAtoday isum are monitored by the Independentparty of lawyerslegal councils ethicists product andEngineers that ask themselves how thisproductcan be misused rather than used andbefore releasing that product we aregoing through all those reviews theother aspect is uh as I mentioned beforeall that tooling that we are giving toour Engineers but as well externally tobe able to use thatwithin application of generative AItechnology and I will give few examplesof that and the last but not least isall the work that Google is doing andourselves withthe educational research andorganizations and providing and learningfrom all of those organizationsourselves to implement and provide thosetoolings and uh best practicesso just to give a few examples that wereleased actually today in experimentalis as you generate generate images weprovide uh digital watermarking based onreally really recentum Innovation from Deep lineallowing to embed an invisibleWatermark behind the generated imagesit's not visible to human eye but it'suh it's traceable from the APperspective the other aspects are safetyfilters that some of you might havealready worked but are truly animportant aspect ofrevising the data the input but as wellthe output giving the customers theconfidence scores as well how harmfulthat content might beand the categories that you might Defineare multiple ranging from war crime toviolencesexual harassment and so on and so forththe third aspect I want to bring to ourattention isbiases so a lot of tools on ourresponsible AIwebsite are available and umfor uh to prevent any biases whetherthis is gender race religionum you will be able to in a similarmanner to head as well and adjust theconfidence coursefor your application and business needsand the last piece that I want to bringto your attention or recitation checksso whenever the text is being generatedwe are providing tools that allow tomonitor how much of that text might havebeen copied so which gives you as well acertain level of insight intoprotecting the IP of of the original andhow how the model is being used togenerate new contentsoI want to pause for a second and if saytechnology is great butresponsibility is even more important soif there's anything that would take fromthis presentation is that we all need touse that great technology with hugeopportunities with huge responsibilityso successful II is only responsible AIif you have any questions feel free tocheck that website on Enterprisespecifically and thank you very much foryour attention[Applause]thank you[Music]foreign"
