buthere's our agenda so first and foremosthow many people in the room have heardthe word rise from sapoh that's good that's good so we'regonna we're gonna demystify it a littlebit it's not a product and what it isand but what it actually means and thenmore importantly how we work it withGoogle cloud and what we're doing and umthis is my first time at Google next andI thought sap had a lot of acronyms forthings I I think we've been a little bitoutdone here in terms of what we'regoing so we'll talk about what rise iswe'll talk about rise with the GoogleCloud we have a couple selected customerstories we even have a partner up herethat will talk about us so the storythen we've got some key takeaways andthen as always some time for Q asookay good morning everybody and reallyappreciate your uh coming here thisearly in the morning hopefully I willkeep you awake and and stimulate it somy name is anurag Borough and I've beenin the sap ecosystem for almost 25 yearsand during this time I haveworked across multiple Industries andhelped or partnered with over 100companiesum in their various business and digitaltransformation Journeys uh I oftenpresent as a rise Ambassador andcurrently I work for the North Americas4hana Center of Excellence my areas ofexpertise as you cannot read from therestraddles a lot of different lines ofbusinesses as well as Technologies andthese days a lot of my time goes intoour Cloud Technologies and last but notthe least I do a lot of thoughtleadership and I've written five sapbooks spoken at over 100 conferences andalso I've written a lot of white papersand articles and over to a gym for hisintroI should have gone first because Ihaven't written five books butso uh again good morning Jim soboleskiso 20 years at sap in various rolesstarted out in Consulting PLM inmanufacturing through the ranks even fora period of time wore a sale else hadbut got out of that quickly but for thelast two and a half years I've been theleader of our S4 Hana Center ofExcellence so what does that mean soit's it's a it's a sales support roleit's a Consulting role we're not quotacarrying but we are myopically focusedon helping our customers get to Erpdelivered as a cloud service be itpublic or private how we're doing it andthen in particularum I have a team that specificallyfocuses on are what we call our Legacyon-premise customers we still have closeto 1000 um ECC the former version of sap ECCcustomers in North America that we arehelping to transform to s4hana andtransform to the cloud so um activelybusy I manage a team across all of NorthAmerica and it's a pleasure to talk toyou and again I'll be here for questionsafterwards because I think you get theNext Roomall right let's start with anrise with sap but before I do that Iwant to set the context right so whyshould you care what gives spununintended rise to rise rightwhat are some of the uh the factors welllet's look at umwhat we have gone through in the lastfew years right there's there's been atime of tremendous change right both atthe macro as well as the micro level andit has been exacerbated by the pandemicright can you name one company thathasn't had tobe very agile very Nimble supply ofsuffered from supply chain disruptionsright had to Pivot to newer businessmodels right so all of thesehave become the norm these days on topof that over the past few yearsorganizations and I can't think of asingle organization that has not hadthis problemhave accumulateda huge load of technical debt and whatdo I mean by that is that there's allkinds of applications companies havekind of patched together right dispatchsystems that don't talk too well to eachother with point-to-point Integrationsand the data is not manage in the rightway therefore leading todifficulty in decision makingso all those kinds of things have led towhat we call the single that becausecompanies have been forced to make theseLegacy systems work and for that theyhave had tocreate a lot of customizations right andwould it not be wonderful if you couldtransform this debt into technicalwealth right and you could do that andRises one of the ways we'll talk aboutit by which you can move from an era oftechnical debt to technical wealth basedon a very modern cloud-basedarchitecture that's scalable that'sresilient that's extensible that'smodular Etclet's start talk about one macro Trendright companiesworldwide right they have lots ofimportant projects that they want totake on but the rising costs of capitallast few quarters right we have seen theFederal Reserve raising interest ratesrepeatedly right so is it getting anycheaper no so you want economical waysto be able tocarry out these important projects rightand with the capabilities we providewith rice you'll you'll be able to dothat because this is really all about acloud transformationlet's talk about Labor marketstoday's Workforce is not interestedthose of you who are on sap possibly ECChow many of you here on sap ECC right afew buteven if you're on S4 Hannahum on premiseyour Workforce today right is does notlikes to work on exciting stuff rightthose old Grace screens from sap rightthe way transaction goes all those kindsof things that's not what today's workerwants right they want to or be moreintelligent right work moreintelligently more efficiently and alsolabor markets are tight right so whatdoes that mean we provideworld-class platform and capabilitieswe'll talk about our business technologyplatform right we also have where inInnovation intelligence all of this isis built in we also have low code nocode Base by which you can easilyrealize your your business needs andlast but not the leastyou are probably under a lot of pressurefrom both your internal stakeholders aswell as external stakeholders to meetyour commitments your obligations tomake this a more sustainableplanet right A Greener Planet soif the answer to all of these questionsor few have encountered all of what Isaidthen you're ready for rise with sapum did you want to add anything well Iwas just going to add you know um we'veall heard these pressures economicTrends and going forward but I like totalk about these things is what are theunique things or The Innovation thingsthat sap brings to it and justsustainability so think about goingforward managing or excuse me mergingyour ESG credits with your financialLedger and putting Financial monetaryamounts to your green ledger to yourcarbon emissions everything else isexactly the difference between you knowbringing a business solution andmarrying it with um you know some of theGoogle AI functionalities that we'recoming out withthank you Jimso let's move tothe next component here so what exactlyis Rise right you've probably heard thethe term you've it has come up in manydiscussions but it's really it's apackage right it's a comprehensiveoffering consisting of number oneor Erp software which is s for Hanaclouduh industry best practices and andstandards andcustomer oh sorry outcome drivenservices for companies to be able to runall their business processes in thecloud so it's a combination of it's It'sa comprehensive offering and so I it'snot one product the reason I ladies outin this manner is these are some of thecommon questions we get from ourcustomers they sometimes feel that ohrice is one thing one software or oneapplication no it's a combination ofthings products servicesit is transformative right so whenyou're thinking about risewe encourage our customers not to takethe lift and shift mentality a goodanalogy islet's say you have been living in thesame house for the last whatever 10 15years over time you have accumulated alot of junk that lies in the basementand other corners of the room do youwould you really want to carry all ofthose things to a brand new house custombuilt house right would you not want toleverage all the Wonders all thebeautiful things that you have in yourhouse right sotherefore you if this is more of thetransformation that you should thinkabout not oh okay we're just going tomove our on-prem stuff to the cloud thatshould not be the approach becausethat's the approach then you're notgoing to be able to get a big return oninvestmentit is 100 Cloud Rises 100 well why isthat important becauseonce in a while customer is going to askus oh you know what this is great but wewould like to just stay with herECC or s4hana on-prem system well theanswer is that's not right rise is abouta cloud transformation we want customersto be able to take advantage of all thethings that we offer when you move tothe cloud right so the on-prem componentis simply not part of the overall ricelet me say something on that too so justmake it clear rise is not just aboutgetting sap in the cloud this is not ourprogram just to take our Erp system andput it in the cloud rise as anarch isgoing to show on a future slide is aI'll call it a concierge service to helpcustomers adopt the cloud holisticallybecause it's more than just Erp in thecloud it's using cloud services forInnovation and Technologies disruptorsit's more than just hosting it on ahyperscaler it's about having elasticityit's about having flexibility all thosethings have nothing to do with Erp theyhave to do with delivering in a cloudmentality and what we're doing so ashonorable goes through this we'll showyou some of the process analyzes thatwe'll go through to help you remove someof the technical debt we'll show yousome of the things to help youunderstand what it like to be a cloudadopter be a cloud mentality more thanjust having it hosted sitting in thereand getting all those Cloud benefits andthen ultimately uh you like to use thephrase delivering Erp as a cloud serviceas part of your ecosystemthanks Jim and last but not the leastit is a name it's not an actstarted some presentations in the pastby asking this so-called trick questionhey does anyone know what rice standsfor you know gingerly maybe a couple ofhands go upsaying I don't think it stands foranything I said that's the right answerit doesn't it is a word it's not anacronymso what exactly is the rise Vision rightso now we get into the components uhstarting to kind of unwrap or feel thelayers of that onion sofirstly the goal for sap so once thewhat do we want our customers to get outof rice right to be an intelligentInnovative sustainable Enterprise andthe components that will help them getthere let's start with the one at thebottom right that's the foundationalinfrastructure layer right soin this overall offering that we havefor you customers have the option ofchoosing their hyperscaler Partners suchas Google Cloudthere's certain instances where we alsooffer the sap data centers as the thehyperscaler or infrastructure layeron top of that we have the businesstechnology platform how many of you hereare familiar with btpvery good about 50 percentso btp is our technology nerve centerright it is whatbrings allall technical pieces together it is thatFoundation the technology foundation onwhich your modern this platform ofinnovation is built it is where you'regoing to do your application developmentyour extensions your data management theartificial intelligenceand let me solve anything I think yeah Icovered all the different components yesso that's wherea bdp comes the picturethe layer here Cloud Erp right that isour S4 Hammer Cloud solution that's thefunctional business core of rice and ontop of that the icing on the cakeyou have the best practices right lineof business best practices that you canleverage Straight Out of the Boxso the goal so what is the ultimatepurpose right what do we want customersto be able to do in a very strategic waywe want with rise our goal is thatcustomers should be continuouslybe able to improve their top linesbottom lines and green Lines byconstantly innovating rightThe Continuous Improvement is also partof ourone of goals that we have in that withall of that we provide here it providescustomers with the opportunity tocontinuously fine tune keep looking attheir business processes right look foropportunities to improve to become moreefficient rightand last but not leastto have that trusted relationship withyour partner and by partner I don'tdon't just mean sap because even thoughsap is will be the primary partner butwe have a huge ecosystem of Partnerssuch as the one we have here for examplewipros is shiram from Wipro I don't seehim here but anywayumwe have over 20 000ecosystem Partners right so the wholeidea is that along with ricewe you have the commitment of sap andits Partners throughout your CloudJourney right entire Cloud Journey thatyou canum depend on them right at any point oftime at all times right to ensure yoursuccessumokaydid you want to add themall right so transformation and Journeysand all these things these are these areBig undertakings right big words bigphrases so why should you trust andTrust SAP with this responsibility rightso let's let's try and understandlook at some of these these stats herethe first one is the one that comes asurprise to a lot of people that todaywe are the world's number one Cloudapplications vendor and the reason forthat is that over the last many years wehave grown both organically as well asinorganically right so that means thatwe have strong Cloud credentials so whenwe talk about the cloud it's not justyou know a pie in the sky idea for usright we have actually demonstrated thatwe are truly committed to the cloud andtherefore we also want our customers allour customers right to take that Journeyso our Solutions cover a lot ofcountriesevery single industry you can imaginenow 25 right is that a magic number nobut it's just a grouping it could be2027 but essentially we cover everymajor industry now look at this we havehere's these two stats kind of should betaken side by side it's it's veryinteresting and raises eyebrows becausewe even though we have 440 000 customersthat run one or more sap Solutions350 000 of those are mid-marketcustomers Right comes the shock becausethe traditional view of sap is that sapsolution software and solutions they'regood fit only for the largest oforganizations but this number exploresthat myth but what does it also tell youover the past few years as we haveincreasingly taken organizations to thecloud it has become easier for themid-market to adopt our Solutions makingit easy making the barriers to entry orlowering the barriers to entry that'swhat this number means and then talkingabout ecosystem Partners this is a bignumber and this is across the Spectrumwhether it's we're talking aboutproducts whether we're talking aboutServices we are very very aligned rightin close collaboration with our partnersto ensure customer successand here's another big number6.4 billion why is that important thisshows the commitment that we have tomaking sure that we continuouslyinnovate our Solutions right arestate of the art and 6.4 billion is howmuch we spend in 2022 in r d that wasour r d spent a lot of which went intoAI RPA machine learning all theseTechnologies obviously Cloud was theuh Central to that and this is the laststat I'm going to share here very veryimportant sustainability is not simply abuzzword for us right look at the numberof companies rightthat run sap right 97 of the 100greenest companies around sap andinternally we havea lot of we have Incorporated Institutea lot ofsteps to make sure that we ourselves runas a green cupkind offull circle in terms of what we havewhen we talk about rise I talked abouteach of these components a littleearlier I think a couple of slides agoI just want to tell if for maybe acouple of minutes into each of theseright so the cloud Erp our component isalso think of it as you ask for Hanaclub right so that's your Erp corebusiness process transformation sowhen as I said customers should not takethis transformation as simply a lift andshift operator that's what we call thetransformation right we don't call it anupgrade or something like thatso we provide capabilitiesthat help customers understand how goodor how bad how deficienttheir business processes are runningright we are we have aTransformations business structure andSuite called signavio right you probablyheard about Signal View so that willhelpget that information for you and notjust extract that information butprovide guidance right on how you canimprove your business process so you arenot startingfrom a blank slate nor do you have tojust stick to the way you're doingthings todaythis layer is the one that I spoke aboutearlier which is the foundationalthe infrastructure layeroutcome driven Services earlier Jimtalked about uh some of both of ustalked about the technical debt stuffand how sap helps you kind of jettisontechnical debt with outcome drivenservices for example we have things thathelpyou understand what amount ofcustomizations do you have right forexample custom code analyzer is a goodexample of that right it will dive deepinto your system come back with theinformation aboutwhat is it that you can standardizeright maybe there are somecustomizations that can completely goaway because the correspondingcapability is available in s4hanastandard right so these are just anexample there's many more outcome drivenServices you want to add any yeah I cantalk to it right before we go to thenext slide yeah sure yeah so let me justyou know peel the onion back just alittle bit more and talk about you knowServices versus products so rise is aservice that encompasses a few productsbtp signavio and Cloud Erp so first ofall the product the main Erp is s poorHanaum it has been around since 2014 2015.the 23 the 2023 release of S400 that'scoming out now is the Pinnacle releasefor us we are have exceeded full parityof the functionality in ECC so there isno more we're catching up with ECCfunctionality it is in s4hana to thatpoint we've even extended out ourrelease Cycles instead of every yearevery now few years which feature packsgoing on the product is stable theproduct is being adopted and the productis mature with um you know outcomedriven services and things we talkedabout there's some commercial benefitsto rise first of all we've done awaywith the wholeum named user license when you go to thecloud you're a professional user a shopuser a developer user we've gone to whatwe call a full use equivalent which hasmultipliers meaning one full use ofequivalent can be used by 30 employeesat the base level and then five and thenone the right multiplierswithin more of the outcome drivenServices when we bring you to thehyperscaler of your choice preferablyGoogle Cloud kind of stuff out of thebox we offer technical managed servicesto think from the operating systemdatabase down we manage all that singleSLA there's no point into thehyperscaler pointing to us getting allthat managed all of that userssubscription to the software slas arethe thing all under one subscription sowhen we talk about moving from capex toOpex we're making it much easier to dobusiness with sap I want to add moreusers I don't need to have a Contractingevent and get my sales rep involved tobuy more users I can just reallocatebased on those ratios we've talked aboutbefore now when we talk about how do weget companies theresoum transformation is a big word I don'teven like using the word transformationbut a lot you know the where we aresince S4 Hana is now is about you knowsince 2015 eight years old our adoptioncurve right now I'd say we're at thelater adopters dare I say laggards thatare ready to go over to S4 and it spansthe reasons on why they goum either it's just not in their timeright now they haven't they don't seethe value of it because ECC works fineum there's a lot of them but the worstone that I run into with customers iswell end of mainstream maintenance forECC is 2027 so I guess I have to goum that's horrible because there aremore opportunities to innovate yourbusiness and so what I do and my team iswe get involved with them and we take alook at honorable mentioned it what areall your custom objects that you've hadin your environment since 1999 becausethe functionality was missing or youknow you had a certain acquisition youneed to do something we can analyze allthat that for you and say Here's allthese objects you haven't even used themin 10 years get rid of them here's thisseries of objects that um you know whatthis can be replicated with standard outof the box software now on S4 here'sthis smaller set of objects that areleft that are unique to you that aredifferentiating it's the way you go tomarket it's the way you sell the way youmanufacture we need to keep those we cankeep those in the private Cloudenvironment we keep those extensions inthe btp environment to keep you uniquein terms of what we're doing so I lookfor areas to build value I like to walkinto customers right away and just saywhat's your biggest pain point to me ECCworks you know honorod had this slide upthere of the stats I mean 50 years ofbusiness we work is ECC easy to look atis it easy to report against not alwaysbut you know can you know what are yourbiggest problems you have Mr it is likeyou know writing a report spinning offby divestiture trying a new product lineflexibility and nimbalists we help tobuild that value case of where you wantto go and what value you're going to seeand then we'll start to peel the onionsback like you're an on-premise customerand you want to go to the cloud oh mygosh I'm giving up control of all mybases in Abba no you're not you knowthat we still need basis we still needop up we still need that in-housesupport what we want to do how do wemove forward to it how do we do itwithout you know I don't have my handson the environment anymore what what doI doum I I have ns2 or itar and Cloudsovereignty issues we can handle allthat we can discuss all that and then wetalk about like oh my gosh where do Istart you know and so part of theseservices and deliverables is we willwork with you to identify the value caseidentify uh suggested adoption you knowum do you want to start by product linedo you want to start by Revenue do youwant to start by country where do youwant to start this change do you want todo full Green Field and just go straightout of the box and get rid of all my badhabits do I want to come over and doBrownfield in a second you know comeover in segments do I want to do youknow data transfer stimulus there's allthese things each one of these steps iswhat we call our customer valueassessment or our vision to Valueprogram that my team leads but I bringEnterprise Architects solutionArchitects and value Engineers to helpyou understand all these Technical andbusiness tracks for the value thetechnology how does it work how do I letyou take control of my TMs or AMS interms of what we're doing and how do Ibegin to adopt it and this whole serviceis free my team does it we engage it'snot a paid service sap but to help youunderstand what you're getting into tobegin to adopt this Cloud mentality andultimately delivering Erp as a cloudservicesoit's working so as I said as for Hondahas been around since 2014 2015 rise hasbeen around since the little q1 of 2021right now over 3 800 individualcustomers are hosted in a hyperscaler ona rise platform right now now each ofthose customers probably has multipleinstances and multiple environments andI think the number of systems undermanagement from our um you know sapEnterprise Cloud managed service is over10 000 different instances right now andwe are literallyadding in the order of like 100 to 120per month instance they're going up sothe traction is there and it's happeningsowhy sap and why Google so here's ascreenshot of our big event Sapphirewhen Christian and Thomas were meetingand what they're doing and what kind ofpartnership do we haveI think the very first one the mostimportant one is that alphabet runs onS4 Hanaso the just think of the revenue and theexpanse of alphabet across all theirdivisions they run on a single instanceof S4 Hana right now and they're goingthrough the program and the financetransformation they're doing andbringing multiple programs into thereand they are probably one of our bestreferences and we they actually host attheir facility and talk about howthey're moving everything into a singleenvironmentyou heard a lot yesterday about theDuets and what we're doing and I thinkyeah in the next slide here how do wepartner together so you sawas for Hana and it sits on top of ourtechnology platform btp so when we talkabout adopting standard technology andadopting and even making yourcustomizations to keep you uniquewe throw out a phrase a lot called theclean Core so what does that mean sowhat the clean core means is you canextend your environment you can adddifferentiating functionality that isnot out of the box you can customize theenvironment to keep you differentiatingyou do it in the btp layer and downthere for our extensions and ourIntegrations are all done keeping thecore Erp clean the clean Core what doesthat afford you think aboutum upgrades think about nibleness whenyou put a new feature pack in a newService Pack you do something elseum you know we don't eliminate it butalmost nil regression testing now it'sstandard it just goes in there's a greatgreat I think they're here actually uhreference storyum in terms of the Levi Strauss thatthey were honest for they just went toS4 as is and built all theircustomizations in S4 first feature packI think the upgrade system was daysweekends down days kind of stuff whenthey finally moved all theircustomizations out that they need to putthem in the layer down there it wasminutes and I've heard like 17 minutesdone tested off and running so it's thatclean Core kind of thing that helps youstay Nimble helps you stay flexible sowhen I go to my I.T leaders and say heywhat's your biggest problem like uhwe're going to divest the company orwe're just going to make an acquisitionand we're going to do something I needto move quick it's the clean Core thathelps you do that and the clean Corethat sits on btp btp is where we willtalk to GoogleP there was a session yesterday I don'tknow if you saw it but the way that wemanage our data and pair it up withbigquery also the btp layer is where wewill interface with Google AI andeverything you've seen so the duet andthe workspace that it's all built intoS4 so in the sap strategy and AI is thatwe are absolutely going to explore itwe're going to Leverage The gcp toGoogle tools and what we're doing butour context and focus on AAA is businessprocess business focus and that's wherewe stay now if you want to have an AIinfrastructure or a question that goesoutside business and talks to externalsources or do something else that's whywe're going to partner with Googleleverage Our Best in Class businessknowledge and business processes marriedwith the Google ecosystem intelligentWorld stuff to come together is thatpairing of getting AI for businesspurposes and then AI for everything thatwe're seeing going around here soI think that is it now did our friendjoin us yeah yeah so um we have thankyou Jimum as you can imagine there's a lot ofcustomer success stories so it's oftenquite hard to just pull a few but we dohave one and we're very lucky to have avery trusted partner of ours Wiprothat's going to present their rise withS4 rise with sap on Google Cloud successstory and for that I would like toinvite shiramuh on stage please he'll introducehimself and then I have a few more Iwould say shorter success storiesoh myGodthank youyepI've been with you bro for 18 and a halfyears all in all sap uhso this is an interesting story okay sowe are one of the largest sap customeruh we were on ECC since law 2018 is whenwe started working on the export Journeywe were on Sultan Hana then we moved onto S4 on 1809 and then we thought we'llmeet at hyperscaler and start working onthe cloud Journeyso that was 2021-22 and last year wesigned a rice deal with sap on gcp uhand we were the first si in the world todo that number onenumber twothe main features of the deal wereSimplicity scaling security andinnovationso one simple contract with the CP andGoogle one single Networkto get everything done for availabilitysecurity layer was built on all thelayers application layer infline layerany layer and the best one was scalablemodel where the industry is changing sofast that we were able to get theplatform for our choice with sap as thethe application layer and built our 250000 people on this platform without anyissues that was a success storythank youthank you thanks ashram any questionsfor Sharon on their orI guess we can take it at the last butnot the least TC reductionreally great contractokay so I have a couple more hereum so just take a lookinch Cape so inch capeis a is in the automotive industry andit's it's fairly large 15 000 employeesand it's about revenue of close to 8billion euros right and so one of therecurring themes you'll see with thesesuccess stories are the drivers are kindof similar right there's obviously everycustomer has its own needs but you willsee a common pattern and the challengesas you can see wereuh inch Cape wanted a streamlineoperations be more responsive they alsowanted to have provide a very veryseamless customer experience and thenyou see the final bullet which is alsogoes back to theum the talent the talent attractionshortagerealm right they wanted to have their IDstaff focus on on more more Innovativeautomated Smart Technologies than justyou know doing the mundane stuff rightthe the repetitive stuffand so they chose rise with sap and whatI'm I'm not going to read from the slidebut you can see that Chief digitalofficer what he says about it right thiswill provide an enhanced customerexperience right and will help them growtheir businessand here are the reason it's kind oflooks like a collage out here is becausethese came in in different kind offormats but Energizer Holdings uhrequires uh very littleum introduction right the bunny and allthat kind of stuff of course they alwaysneed energy right and arise with sapwill provide them with that energy toconstantly keep keep growing right andyou can see the words of their uh CIOright um why they chose rise and how ithas helped them tell usis umvery large Communications technologycompany uh based out of Canada it's got18 billion dollars in annual revenue andalso about 18 millionumconnections right uh customerconnections and again you can there's wedon't have a quote here but they uh wentwith rise with sap on on Google cloudandthey are also now look at the last partof this this goes back to this wholepartnership we're talking about rightwith with cortex and and bigquery rightso they want to leverage the platformrightum and and all the sap capabilities thatsit atop that platform we have one moregft which is basically acompany that does helps digitaltransformation for financials and andinsurance sectorsumsothey also have a similar success storyand then the last one is a big I.TServices firm called buildersoftand they also carried out I think it'sthat one is probably similar to theWipro story they wanted to carry out atransformation their organization andthey chose rise with sap because of allthe capabilities that rise providesright there because for them forConsulting companies especially it isthe human resources are the biggestassets right so they want theirWorkforce to be able to work oncutting-edge technology right so thatthey are ready to meet their customersneeds and that's what rise has providedthem so these are some success storiesthat speak for themselvesand then we would like to actually wrapthings upso I think we've said everything we wantto say I want to leave a few minutes forquestions and kind of stuff butRise Again program S4 Hana our core Erpsolution and what we're doing and againeven though we have transformation inhere sometimes a big scary word but weare helping companies adopt the cloudmentality use the cloud as a businessand innovation technology tool andinnovator and again the future justthink of Erp as a cloud service I wantto download MRP I want to downloadprocure to pay and I want to use it interms of what we're doing take a look atthe Rise program on how we're helpingcustomers again like this conciergeservice like how to step into it how toramp up getting into it how to become acloud company and how to do it with onehand one SLA one subscription price toall make it easier for you in terms ofwhat we're doing we've talked a lotabout the Google and sap partnership I'mreally excited to see how it goesforward again I talked about the scopeof the essay sap AI inclus relevantreliable and responsible in the businesscontext of AI anything outside thatbigquery big data everything else we'reworking with Google to do that and thenlots of customers and lots of tractionand somebody's Wipro one thing I itdoesn't have to slide here but I'll bereminiscent mentioning if any of yourcompanies or anything else areunfamiliar with S4 maybe just read someblogs and those kinds of things weactually have a service we call it umcustomer value exploration it isactually a live session of s4hana and wecan host these sessions virtually and weinvite 10 20 companies bring three orfour people it's a preset environmentit's a preset business scenario like umlike a marketing or a distribution oryou know some kind of quick environmentso it may not be your industry butyou're going to be given a budget thenyou're going to have to build someproducts ship it sell it you know buildinvoices and everything else the intentof the program is to get you interactingwith s4hana so again may not be yourindustry street but you're looking atthe UI you're looking at what we callthe insight to action you make adecision and the analytics areimmediately updated it brings in some ofthe machine learning it brings in someof the RPA things just to introduce youto these Technologies and then just tomake it fun because we do it virtuallyacross multiple companies we make it agame you know we're like hey Verizon'son here and Anheuser-Busch is on hereand you know halliburton's on here andAnheuser-Busch did the best and they winit's 90 minutes if you're interested Iwill um I'll get your card or somethingthat we publish a schedule of you knowwhen we go out there get involved in itgo see it it lets you actually touch anddrive the system and see the things ofS4 to go oh okay we've had great successin using it
