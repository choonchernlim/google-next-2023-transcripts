be here in person today withall of you thanks everyone for joiningmy name is Mark lowmeyer and I lead thecompute and machine learninginfrastructure product team at Googlecloud and I'm really really excitedtoday to be able to share more with youabout all the amazing products we'vebeen building and how they can help youachieve your goals uh later in thissession my colleague Sachin Gupta willshare the latest on our storagenetworking and distributed Cloudproductsso at Google we always start with thecustomer and so let's start today withwhat we're hearing from all of you youknow our customers are telling us theywant to enable and accelerate theiroverall companies businesstransformationand at the heart of this are really theapplications that support and Empoweryour customers and enable your employeesand if you look across this applicationportfolio many customers have hundredsor in some cases thousands ofapplications but they generally fallinto these three big categoriesfirst virtually everyone sees thetransformational opportunity that'savailable with generative AIbut if you look at it most customers arereally in the early stages of figuringout where to startsecond customers are looking to rapidlybuild new modern applications leveragingeverything the cloud has to offerand third last not not least let's notforget those traditional Enterpriseapplications which for many of ourcustomers represent the vast majority oftheir workloads you want to make surethose applications can really continueto thriveand as it leaders you have to enable allof this while your core responsibilitiesare becoming even more complex you haveto maintain reliability and security athigher scale and under new threats youhave to reduce operational complexitywhile hiring and retaining a world-classteamand you have to meet aggressivesustainability goalsso as we look across these it's reallyclear to us that the old approaches arenot going to meet the new challengesaheadwe've never be seen before the kinds ofDemands that these new workloads areplacing on the infrastructure and whilethis is true across all types ofworkloads probably the best example ofthis is AI so if you look at this charthere it's showing the growth and thesize of the number of parameters inlarge language models over the last fiveyearsand they're increasing in size by 10xper year so that's 10 to the fifth over5 years which is a lot of zeros forthose of you who are counting sounfortunately we can no longer justthrow more general purpose Hardware atthis problem and one of the reasons whyis that the benefits of Moore's Law areslowing downso for example while transistor count isstill doubling every two years it's notdoing so at a fixed cost and Powerso as a result it's really clear what'sworked for us in the past is not goingto be able to prepare us for the futurewe need a more intentional approach toCloud infrastructureso let's talk about how we're respondingto this at Googleso our strategy here is centered arounda concept that we call workloadoptimized infrastructure and the coreidea is to look at literally each andevery workload and then design andoptimize at a systems level acrosscompute storage and networking hardwareand and across software as well to meetthe unique needs of each and everyworkload and as a result we can deliverbreakthrough gains on the outcomes thatour customers care about and need forthose workloads across performancereliability security cost andsustainabilitynow anyone can say these words righteasy to say but what enables Google toactually deliver is our engineeringexcellence and platform level innovationSo within this there are really fourmain areas to set us apart first at theheart of the platform is our deepsilicon and Systems Innovation such asour tpus our offloads Optical switchesand more that I'll share todaysecond we're also open and ecosystemfriendly embracing Partners acrossHardware platforms such as Intel AMD andNvidia and a broad range of Open Sourceand software partnersthird we continue to expand our planetskill footprint leveraging scalabledistributed systems and then finally ourinfrastructure is AI driven andautomated to help Empower your teams todo more as you saw in the earlierkeynote yesterday with duet AIso this is sort of the high levelbackground now let's get into how thisis resulting in concrete benefits foreach workload type and let's start withour favorite AI workloadsso you know here we're really reallyfortunate to be able to work withthousands of customers across manyIndustries and verticals to help themleverage AI to transform their businessthe customers that are the mostsophisticated and the most knowledgeablein the space are choosing Google becauseAI is in our DNA so let me share morefrom startups to Enterprises customerschoose Google Cloud for AI because ofour deep expertise across all therelevant domains of course it startswith industry defining research in factthe original Transformers paper which isthe foundation for the llms taking theWorld by storm today came from Googleresearchthen we channel that research intoCutting Edge models such as pom2 andmany many more that you heard aboutyesterdaybut it's not just about our models it'salso about as I mentioned beforeembracing the ecosystem and open sourceand Google is a really great partner andsignificant contributor herehowever the models by themselves are notenough you also need to know how toscale them in production and at Googlewe have unique experience runningrunning many apps that serve literallybillions of users eachuh and to do all of this you of courseneed to build on the best infrastructureso now let's dig into our AI optimizedinfrastructure nextum at Google we're building theindustry's most complete and mostadvanced AI Cloud platform for more thana decade we've been perfecting anintegrated system that's designed for AIworkloadsit's designed to meet the needs of eachand every AI workload and every customerand user type from model Builders toProviders to Consumersworking from the bottom up it startswith our leading TPU and GPU acceleratedComputing options complemented by arange of AI optimized storage and dataintegration optionswe bring these together into a superComputing system with scalablenetworking offloads water cooled systemsand moreand we make it really easy to consumewith support for both GCE and gkeand finally we deliver unique value andsoftware enabling training and servingof workloads across multiple systemscomplemented by open Frameworks highperformance compilers and morefinally with vertex AI we make it easyto integrate and serve Google models andour partners ecosystem models in yourapplicationsSo Yesterday Thomas announced theexpansion of our TPU portfolio with TPUv5e so let me go deeper here nowso given the massive demand that we'reseeing for AI optimized infrastructurewe wanted to make tpus even moreaccessible to a broader range ofcustomers and use caseswith TPU v5e we've made major strides inefficiency with up to 2x better trainingperformance per dollar versus TPU V4 andtwo and a half times better inferenceperformance per dollarwe've also made them more versatileincluding eight flexible VM shapes thatserve our customers diverse workloadsizes across training tuning and servingand finally through the magic ofhardware and software working togetherwe've enabled these smaller systems toscale some of the largest workloads withtechnologies that enable a singleworkload to span multiple clustersscaling to tens of thousands of thesechipsall right so now for a real treat we'reactually going to show you uh this AIoptimized Cloud infrastructure for thefirst time to the general public so withthat let's uh let's cue the videoforeignapplications are powered by somethingyou almost never get to seepurpose-built AI infrastructure andwhile we're operating thisinfrastructure Planet scale it allstarts with the chip Google's tensorprocessing units or tpus are customdeveloped application specificintegrated circuits designed to createEd scale supercomputers that handle someof the world's largest AI workloads thereal magic happens when these chips areall interconnected using our customintercore Optical interconnect to createa single super computer capable ofutilizing thousands of these chips tohandle some of the world's largestinference and training workflowsrealizing the power of our data centernetworking we can create large scaleversions of such super computersconsisting of hundreds of thousands ofinterconnected chips Google has taken astep further and utilized Opticalcircuit switch technology that allowsthe super computers to reconfigurethemselves and create efficient machineshapes and sizes this is all madepossible by our state-of-the-art OCSsoftware infrastructure optimized forefficiency and speedour vertical power delivered to thesuper computers is pulled by our latestgeneration water cooling system that isdesigned with sustainability in mind allthis technology has the attention of ourdedicated team of data centertechnicians and security personnel thereto guide through our various securityprotocols all of this operating at thescale of our entire planet because webelieve that AI is for everyonethank youall right so that was awesome as ahardware geek I think there's nothingnothing cooler than checking out thehardware behind all these systems youknow but if you think about it it's notjust about the hardware equallyimportant is the software on top of thisHardware that enables our customers tomake the AI development smooth and costeffectiveso here first we're really excited toannounce first class support for pytorchfor tpuspytorch is an incredibly popularframework for AI developers and now theycan leverage the benefits of tpus inthese pytorch environmentssecond we're making it easy toefficiently scale model training andserving across physically disparateclusters with multi-slice training andmulti-host inferencingthird we're making it easy toorchestrate AI workloads with GK supportand streamline data integration tuningand application development with vertexAIas a result leading AI innovators likeanthropic are seeing significantbenefits from TPU v5e as they build thenext wave of AI on Google Cloudand we're really looking forward toenabling the broader industry with theseamazing TPU capabilities now and in thefutureso tpus are great but we're alsopartnering and investing to offer thebest cloud for gpus as well you heardfrom Thomas and Jensen about our deeppartnership and capabilities we'redelivering here together so again let mego a little bit deeper here nowa few months ago we introduced our newG2 VM based on the Nvidia L4 GPUGoogle Cloud was the first and still theonly leading cloud provider to offer theservice to customersG2 is great for lower for a lower priceof entry with two to four times betterperformance compared to Prior generationNvidia T4 gpusG4 excels for cost-effective Gen AI usecases and other use cases such asvirtual workstation or digital twinsimulationsand as a result of this value we'reseeing rapid adoption across manyleading customers that you see herenext as you heard earlier we're alsoreally excited to introduce the generalavailability of our A3 VMS coming nextmonthA3 is based on the Nvidia h100 GPU andit's purpose built to train and serveincredibly demanding AI models and llmsA3 leverages Google's leading networkingTechnologies to provide massive scaleand performance including our customdesigned IQs offloading the host and itintegrates with our data center networkwith reconfigurable Optical links thatcan adjust the topology on demandA3 is a leap in super Computingcapabilities over prior generations withthree times faster trainingA3 is also able to operate at scalescaling to tens of thousands of h100gpusfinally A3 is fully supported throughGCE gke and vertex AI offering a widerange of choices for AI researchersdevelopers and operatorsso across gpus and tpus we areinnovating at a systems level to givecustomers the strong Foundation theyneed to build generative AI servicesthat will transform their businessbut uh don't just take it from me let'sgo to video again to hear directly froma leading gen AI innovator character AIabout their experienceone of the founding Engineers thecharacter AI character AI is a fullstack uh directed consumersocial AI platform technically speakingwe'll need to make our entire stack morescalable everything from bringing onmore accelerators to power the languagemodel to improving the back-end systemswe host all of our productinfrastructure on Google Cloudincreasingly using Google's acceleratorsgpus and tpusthese are the lifeblood of our productso on Google Cloud we canexperiment and find what is the rightplatform for a particular workload it'sgreat to have that flexibility to choosewhich products and solutions are mostvaluable so yeah big fans of GoogleCloudall right that is that is so cool by theway if you haven't tried it yet I wouldhighly recommend you check out characterAI it's a really really uh cool andinteresting serviceall rightum so a lot of innovation in our AIoptimized infrastructure but of courseyou also have a lot of other types ofworkloads that are really powering yourbusiness so now let me share more aboutwhat's new for Enterprise workloads ourcustomers here have a broad range sowe've optimized our VM families for allof these workload types ranging fromcommon web applications to demandingdatabases such as sap Hanaso here let me share some excitingupdates on the new products that we'reintroducing just a few months ago we didour new c3vm Google was the first toMarket with VMS based on the fourthgeneration Intel Sapphire Rapidsprocessor which also leverages ouroffload Technologies and provides up to35 percent better performance versuscomparable generation VMS with aconsistent performance and greatmaintenance experiencenow we're really really pleased toannounce we're extending the C family toboth AMD and arm processorswe're announcing the new c3d VM based onamd's fourth generation epic processorC3 dvms offer up to 45 performanceimprovement over the prior generationAMD VMS for workloads such as postgresMySQL redis and many morefinally we're also really excited topre-announce the preview of c3a ournewest arm-based VM it offers up to 40percent Better Price performance thancomparable x86 VMS for a very very costeffective solutionin addition we're also focused onenabling leading solutions for highperformance Computing across Industriessuch as Financial Services engineeringdesign and morein support of this we recently announcedour new H3 VMS purpose built for HPCworkloadswith full core performance and 200gigabits per second networking H3outperforms the prior generation C2 VMSby up to three times across a broadrange of HPC workloadsin addition we're really pleased topartner with a broad range of HPCfocused ecosystem Partners like Alterato help our customers realize the fullbenefits of these amazing Technologiesso these are some really great optionsfor compute but many Enterpriseworkloads also require block storageand here we offer a wide range ofoptions to support our customers iopsand throughputs needsto meet these needs last year weintroduced hyperdisc and Enterpriseclass block storage servicehyperdisc fundamentally decouplescompute from Storage much like a privateCloud San but with all the elasticityscalability and economic benefits of acloud service enables you to dynamicallytune the storage to the new unique needsof each workload and it's built to scaleso today I'm really really pleased toannounce major major advances forhyperdisc first I'm excited to announcethe preview of hyperdisc extreme with500 000 iops which is the fastest amonghyperscalerssecond the new hyperdisc balance is inpreview next month it's really ideal forgenerous general purpose workloads andit delivers 2 to 10 times betterperformance than comparable offersfinally to complete the family hyperdiscthroughput is now GA and provides fastcost effective block storage forthroughput Hungry workloads such as dataanalyticsso that's all great but I'm even moreexcited to introduce a new capabilityhere called hyperdisc storage pools nowCloud up Cloud cost optimization is topof mind for many of you as I've spokenwith you and within this storage hastraditionally been one of the biggestculprits of cloud spendand why is that well discs are oftentied to individual VMS and therefore notoptimally utilized on-prem you use asand storage pool to address this but inthe cloud such pools have not reallybeen available so farso we're changing this today withhyperdisc storage pools in previewthese storage pools can be shared acrossyour workloads simplifying managementand driving higher utilizationso by combining the benefits of a singlestorage capacity pool with thinprovisioning compression deduplicationand other Technologies we can reduce theTCO for workloads like databases by upto 40 percentreally really amazingso now let's jump to another workloadand one of the most common Enterpriseworkloads and one I happen to knowpretty well everything running invsphere on-premso with Google Cloud VMware engine youcan simply bring your vsphere basedworkloads to Google and will manage theinfrastructure for you with greatavailability and performancetoday we're announcing the next stage ofinnovation with gcbefirst our new node type ve2 with twoterabytes of RAM and flexible andpowerful vcpu and storage configurationssecond we're adding three new externalstorage options support for NetAppvolumes support for Google file storeour own file system and support for vsanstorage only nodes you'll hear moreabout these laterwith these new options we're making aneven more cost effective to run a broadrange of vsphere-based workloads inGoogle Cloudin fact one customer liq was able tosignificantly increase their applicationavailability reduce incidents and save60 percent in total cost of ownership bymigrating from on-prem to gcve trulytruly amazingmore broadly we know you also want toachieve better reliability in the cloudthan anywhere else and while multi-azavailable slas are great many Enterpriseworkloads also care deeply about the VMlevel SLA so I'm really delighted toannounce a new and improved three ninesuptime SLA for all single instance VMSin Google Cloudand for memory optimized VMS that areused for demanding workloads like sapHana and others we're going even furtherto offer three and a half nine singleinstance SLA which is the highest amongother leading cloud hyperscalerstogether coupled with our ability to donon-disruptive maintenance using livemigration this really makes Google Cloudideal for Mission critical Enterpriseworkloadsso I hope you're all as excited aboutthese new product announcements as I amand to uh to wrap it up I'd like toshare finally an inside look at one ofthe key Technology Building Blocks thatreally enables many of these newproducts you heard about it in Thomas'skeynote and we call this Google Cloudtitanium this is a Next Generationtiered offload technology stackso let me give a little context here youknow if you go back in time in the cloudright initially the host CPU handles itall at all around the workloads aroundthe virtualization software stackstorage I O Network processingeverything was running on that host CPUthen the cloud industry Advanced byoffloading some of those infrastructureoperations onto smartnicsthis delivered really significant gainsit was fantastichowever ultimately the performance andscale was still bound to that host sincethe smart Knicks are running in thosehostsso as we at Google thought about whatthe future of workloads would require weknew we needed to be able to scaleBeyond The Hostso we're really really pleased tointroduce Google Cloud titanium which isa Next Generation tiered offloadarchitecture providing breakthroughscale performance and security that youneed for the future of cloud workloadsto do this we are leveraging andextending our distributed Planet scaleinfrastructure serviceseffectively we can move many of thestorage networking security and otheroperations completely off the host andrun them as processes as a scale outservice in the cloudthis enables us to for example deliverthe 500 000 iops for hyperdisc extremethat I talked about before and we canprovide this even to very small VMS onthe hostso this is a really really fundamentalarchitecture capability that you'regoing to see us leverage more and moreto deliver on our workload optimizedinfrastructure visionall right so I hope you enjoyed thisview into our strategy for workloadoptimized infrastructure and how we'reapplying that to deliver amazingproducts for all of your workloads nowto share what's new with cloud storagenetworking and our distributed cloud mycolleague Sachin Gupta will join us nowwelcome Sachinthank youthanks Mark and hi everyone I'm SachinGupta and I lead the infrastructure andsolutions group here at Google Cloudnow I'm super excited to tell you moreabout how customers are innovating withall the great new products that ourteams have builtearlier Mark talked about the tremendousinnovation in gpus and tpus for AIworkloads from model training to tuningto servingall of this is made possible because ofa foundation of Highly reliable andperformance Storage Solutionsas you know it takes petabytes or moreof data to build and train AI models andmany of those applications leverageexisting Frameworks like Pi torch andtensorflow which often run on filesystemsbut many of you want to Leverage Thescalability the performance and theaffordability of object storageif you try this on your own it can be acomplex task it requires custom codeand that's why we introduced cloudstorage fuseit's a fully managed file system thatallows you to easily run applicationsthat are expecting file systems but ontop of the scalable and performantGoogle Cloud Storageand with the power of gke and Jaiintegration and simple file systemaccesscodeway scale their gen AI Avatar app tohundreds of millions of users in simplya matter of weekswe've also heard the need for ultra lowlatency and terabyte per second filesystems to accelerate demanding Ai andHPC workloads while minimizing TCOlast week we introduced parallel storeour next Generation parallel file systembuilt on Intel deosit provides6.3 X the read throughput performance ofother offeringsand it's deeply integrated with AI andgke helping accelerate AI workloads likesimulation and AnalyticsWe are continuing to enhancestorage and performance for AI andEnterprise workloads running on gkecompared to Amazon EFSfile store has 1.6 extra throughput and15.7 X the iopsand file store Enterprise provides lowlatency High IOP storage for trainingmodelsnow we also heard from you we nowsupport shares as small as 10 gigabytesand grow all the way up to 100 terabytesso you can right size for cost andperformanceSalesforce is a really great example ofthisthey simplified and scaled terabytes ofdata on file store in gke to enableconversational AI to improve customerservice this is such a great Testamentcoming from a company that's centered oncustomer successwhen I speak with customersone of the biggest barriers to migrationthat I've heard about has been aroundmulti-protocol support SMB NFSwe are taking our NetApp partnership toa whole new level with a new fullymanaged first party file storage serviceand nowlike open text you can run and modernizeMission critical Enterprise workloadslike sap and VMware on Google Cloudwithout any refactoring all whileoptimizing costsforeignWe Believe products should be secured byDesignand secure by defaultlast year we were the first and we arestill the only leading public Cloud tooffer a

ifentire projects are deleteddata security startups like cyberhavenaren't just relying on Google backup andRecovery to protect business criticalinformation or to lower coststhey're using it to meet RegulatoryCompliance and to support GK upgrades sothat they can focus fully on businessinnovationbut it's not only about modern workloadsGoogle backup and Recovery can supportall of your major workloads from Googlecompute engine to Google Cloud VMwareengine that Mark talked about thedatabases and sapnow as you can see from AI data and HBCto Modern and Enterprise workloads wehave the right performant andcost-effective storage and dataprotection solutions for youall rightlet's talk about networkingas you get ready as you get your dataready for AIdoing so easily cost effectively andsecurity can be quite complicatedin addition to the most performanceStorage Solutions you also need the bestnetworknow Google's Planet scale network is thebackbone that our customers rely on tomodernize and transform their businessesrapidlyand recently we expanded our Network to38 regions with many more on the waywe enable you to runand build your applications in over 200countries and territoriesand with our subsea cables our 187 Popsthat keep growingwe will now leverage our Network to helpyou to solve the problems withcross-cloud connectivity and securitynow I've spent over two decades in thenetworking industry working very closelywith many many customersand traditional approaches are just notkeeping up with multi-cloud and hybridWorkforce requirementscustomers are having to build complexcollocationsthey're having to manage connectivitymanually across multiple differentcloudsand dealing with different securitystacksthe complexity is dauntingnow sure there are some overlaySolutions in the market but they do notprovide the benefit of a large GlobalNetworkand some of them actuallyforce you to change your applicationsand services stack or your securitystack you can't bring your ownwe want to simplify all of this and makeit easy for you to connect securelycross-cloud so that you can get the mostout of Google cloud services such asspanner bigquery and vertex AIThomas introduced this yesterday and I'mexcited to introduce to you the crossCloud Networkit's a global networking platform thathelps you connect and secureapplicationsacross cloudsthe cross-cloud

partnershipwith broadcom semantic and Palo Altonetworks bringing you an integrated SSCsolution for your remote users andBranch officeswhat cross-cloud network enables istruly incrediblebut don't take it from me let's heardirectly from Ken Kirchoff seniordirector of networking from Pricelineit's priceline's goal to make themoments that matter for our customersit's very important for us to be able toserve customers with a great website andprovide them with the best experience nomatter where they are we launched ourfirst application running on Virtualmachines four years later we have all ofour infrastructure running on GoogleCloud modern stock in kubernetes with 12Factor patterns and we're consuming manyGoogle managed services includingdatabases analytics Ai and ml it's beena complete transformation we also useGoogle's worldwide networking so that wecan provide them with deals andinventory for flights hotels and rentalcarsby having cross-cloud networking we cantake the pieces of our company and theservices our company and run them wherethey're best suited and think of them asa whole product rather than separatepieces with Google cross Cloud Networkwhat we expect to gain is the ability tomorph our connectivity to other cloudsdata centers and partner companieswithout having to be bought into aspecific decision and stuck with it sowe're very happy to partner with GoogleCloud to be able to go into the futurewith themwhat an amazing storyit's been great to work with Ken and histeam and they really helped us shape theroadmap as well as you sawcross-cloud Network offers an opensecure and optimized platformthat is designed to help you accelerateyour businessby enabling you to very easily accessGoogle servicesand securely from the cloudnowwe understandnot all
