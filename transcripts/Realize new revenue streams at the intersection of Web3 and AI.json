the Google Cloud'soverall web3 efforts here and it's mypleasure to be joined by threeco-founders of different protocols andwe'll be talking to Mo Arthur and Lehmanfor the next 45 minutes or so today justa little bit of context obviously therehas been a huge amount of investmentinto these two spaces that are verytopical and Ai and web3 over the pastfive ten years and of course what we seetoday is just above the surface andthere's a ton of effort that's beengoing on for decades that's paved theway to enable us to be where we aretoday but of course as generative AI inparticular has started to take mindshare from all other areas of technologyI think that there is a huge amount ofopportunity that lives across the spanof AI and web3 and whether that's AI forweb free or whether that's web 3 for AIas we will talk a little bit about todaysoum I'm going to just ask our paneliststo briefly introduce themselvesindividually and then we'll jump into itso mo why don't you start us off sureum hey everyone I'm Mo co-founder andCEO of Aptos Labs my background comesfrom working in the finance industryI've worked on places like BlackRock andalso at BCG where it helps self-involvedfunds deploy deploy Capitalultimately stumbled into crypto in 2016.been in the ethereum ecosystem for quitesome time saw some of the challenges oflaunching financial instruments on theethereum in the ethereum ecosystem andultimately joined a company calledFacebook or a project called Libra ledby a company led by Facebookand that led us to thinking about howpayments and money could potentially berevolutionized fast forward we Face somechallenges and we now are independentcompany we're Aptos based in the BayArea 150 people with 16 uh 16 of themhaving phds in various Fields but whenwe think about what web3 can do or whata protocol can do and especially at theintersection of AIwe know we need to take a very seriousapproach to building a protocol that'sstable that's reliable and scalable wedid that for billions of people when wewere you know in our Facebook days I'vebeen excited to obviously continue onthat path independently and happy to getinto that thanks Mike Arthur hi everyonemy name is Arthur Brightman I'm aco-founder of the Tesla's project soteslos is a decentralized ecosystem it'sa blockchain an open source piece ofsoftware meaning anyone can come in andparticipate on Taylor's blockchain a bitabout my own background my background isin Quality Finance I worked in San DiegoArbitrage high frequency trading allthis nice stuff for large financialinstitutions like Morgan Stanley GoldmanSachs I also worked a little bit inrobotics at Google actually I was aresearch engineer at Google X and thenthe project became waymo and I I startedworking on until this very early on in20 in 2014 the chain launched in 2018 itwas the first major proof of stakeprotocol uh with economic incentives tolaunch we are also I think the firstprotocol to truly scale with an approachthat we've developed over the pastcouple years and so if you're lookingtoday at uh Webster I would say the mostimportant thing is what is the what isthe value prop because we've seen a lotof Technology being built and sometimesthe value proposition is not reallyclearly articulatedcompared to what you might find intraditional approaches or traditionalServices the the value prop easydecentralization is censorshipresistance right it's a reason that forthis entire technology and this is Ithink where Taylor's really shines it'sbeen built from the ground up withCommunity participation in mind it's ablockchain that can evolve meaning thatthe participants of the network can voteon upgrade it's not controlled by acompany it's not controlled by acentralized entity it's a decentralizedsystem and we've gone now through about14 upgrades which is why you know westarted out strong with the proof ofstake approach and this is also enabledus to really keep with the days and nowto embark on this scaling Journeythank you Arthur Lehman uh way morethat's cool I didn't know about thatthat's really neat I love that so uh I'mthe co-founder of hedera in 2015 is whenI made the hashgraph algorithm and so webuilt hedera with that hedera hashgraphuses that and uh so I'm in theblockchain world now but I actually gotmy PhD in AI which is kind of cool sowe're doing the intersection of one ofmy two loaves with the other one whichis just kind of neat but I was doingreinforcement learning and deep learningwhich back then nobody knew about ittoday it's just doing all sorts ofthings you know you beat the world's goplayer and that top go player that kindof thing and so it's just exciting to beon a panel where I get to to do both ofthe things I think are really coolwonderful so often in these sorts ofpanels you get this really frustratingquestion like what is web3 so we'regonna we're gonna skip that question andwe're gonna go to use cases just quick aquick fire question to get us all warmedup so top of mind for you threeum tell us a quick uh nice use case thatyou like within your your pro effectivechains or web3 more broadly we'll startwith mesureum you know one of the biggest use casefor us goes back into our roots ofthinking about money movement and inorder for that to happen we think aboutall the different components that needto work well if I want to be able tosend money to James when he's in Londonand I'm sitting in New York or now theBay Areaum there's a lot of there's a lot ofcomplexity between there are a lot ofand as a result of that complexity thereare a lot of costs and so whether in youknow in 2016 when I kind of first gotinto the space it was two central bankssending money to each other and wantedto do it on a blockchain that was agreat starting point and how do youscale that to people where it reallymatters and so we we endeavored on thatjourney and today you know money can besent from me to you across the worldwith sub-second finality the life it iswe need to make yeah we need to fix thatflow actuallyum and and if James wants to send thatmoney back to me uh it can happen uh inagain in under a second and that'sreally important because you know youneed a reliable protocol to be able tobasically match the demand of today'stoday's speed and timefast forward you know you need goodProvisions to make that happen you needproper credentialing James needs to knowwho MO is before he sends that moneyover and validate that and so whileAptos is also not only thinking aboutyou know building a protocol that's fastthat has incredibly low latency andevolves it needs to be secure and safespacethat credential is credentialing isn'tsomething we work on independently we'reworking with Partners like MasterCard onthatum and so that's very exciting for usbuilding on top of that Beyond going formoney movement now imagine opening upFinancial access to the broader universeand so if you someone wanted to own apiece of a money market fund for exampleas an alternative to just holding USDollars and potentially having yield youcan do that next and you can go througha second set of kyc on our chainand this isn't hypothetical andsomething that's going to happentomorrow uh in the future FranklinTempleton is actually tokenizing a moneymarket fund on Aptos right and you knowthese are some very interestingFinancial use cases that are quiteum you know fascinating not only for theworld but also for us because it showsthat a protocol is not something and webTheory isn't something in the distantfuture it's actually here todayabsolutely Arthur yeah absolutely and II agree we're in an industry wherethere's a tendency to focus on oh youknow what use case are going to comenext you know what what will happen uhbut we are actually seeing uh peopleusing this uh this network today now youask what's your what's your favorite usecase and uh there's you know there'sbeen many use cases on on on Tesla'srecently uh the titles blockchain hasbeen used by uh the California DMV fordoing uh uh title uh title trackingum it's been used by uh for tokenizationuh like we mentioned by association byBank bdg Pac-12 in Brazil so we've had alot of these um uh it's a very corporateuh use cases that exist it's been usedby uh gaming companies like Ubisoft butif we just go and like my favorite likewhat I really enjoy is there's a hugeart community on tezosum visual artists and we're talkingabout the intersection of AI and itactually started with a lot ofgenerative artists uh now you can useall these AI models to generate almostlike perfect images but when it was justin its in you can see and people wereplaying with this a lot of these artistswho naturally produce digital images asan output found as a home for creatingexperimenting and exchanging and soit might not be as uh uh it's it's notcorporate like uh like those other basicuses but like in terms of like the souland the Heart like what I what's myfavorite I would say that's what it isthat's a great lovely answer and we'lltalk more aboutum web3 for for AI uh in a minuteum Lehman love to hear your thoughts tooyeah so there's really two differentclasses of things that are being builton ledgers right now and we have somevery interesting use cases that I getexcited about one is tokenizing I dothink that ledgers are eventually goingto tokenize everything of value in theworld because it's just so much moreefficient it just intermediates and it'seasier and more secure and ultimatelyeverything a value will be tokenized andwhat we're seeing is new kinds of thingslike you can have a market in carboncredits which is Rife with fraud rightnow but you can use uh hedera and peopleare building markets for tokenizingcarbon credits that eliminate certaintypes of fraud they just becomeimpossible and then they can also dothings like where you tokenize greenenergy or you tokenize non-green energyand you tokenized the curbing credit andyou glue them together and then you havea single token that's both dirty energywith enough carbon credits to offset itto turn it into clean energy these arethe new kinds of things that reallybefore dlts before Ledger has existedwere not we're not happening and maybeweren't easy to ever happen and this isthe kind of way it's changing the worldis tokenization we're going to see moreand more of that and we're seeing hugeamounts of that I saw I met someone whotokenized their house on hedera it'sjust amazing what you can do and you cansay well why do that we already havehouses ah but you could do a titlesearch very fast you could dointeresting things that have neverexisted like you sell tokens that areshares of your house and then you payrent and it goes to those people it'snot a mortgage from a bank it's it's ademocratizing mortgages even it'sallowing Ordinary People to buy piecesof your house and then you just pay rentto them whole new business models can becreated by tokenizationand that's only one of the two majorthings that dlts can do they can also bestoring information immutably foreverwhere you know the whole world sees thesame thing so you can do things like insupply chain and the whole world can seewhat happened we have um the the healthservices in England are are putting onhedera the temperature of covetedvaccines of all the refrigerators hewent through before it got to you so youcan look at the serial number you cansee what was its temperature in allthose refrigerators because the theywere automatically measuring it and thenrecording it for posterity on uh hederaand so you can see in the past where wasit and it can never be changed you knowthat the whole world is seeing the samething they can't cook the books and showyou one set of books and show someoneelse a different set you have a unifiedview of it you have it time stamped youhave it provably then I think this alsois an incredibly important way that uhledgers are going to change the worldand I'm excited to see that happening onhedera as well lovely examples all ofyouum I want to shift the conversation justvery slightly to Ai and we'll start withyou Lehman so I thinkum you know what we're seeing in theworld of you know applied AI right nowinto the to the corporate and consumerSpace is really just the the outcome ofa ton of work over the the history andobviously you have your PhD in this sodo you think that there's any sort ofone specific thing that's like led tothis particular point in time now thatwe're all beginning to hear and enjoythe the benefits of say large languagemodels and then I'll ask you somefollow-up questions and the rest of thepanel as well but just like to hear thatfrom you straight away yes AI is anovernight success but it's taken manydecades to build it's absolutely true soI would really say there's four thingsthat are leading to these suddensuccesses we're seeing so you know wehave chat GPT doing text generation youhave things with diffusion doing umimage generation and then we head beforethat AI was able to beat the worldchampion in go and that same program thesame program can teach itself in a dayto play chess better than anyone on theon the planet or teach yourself to playvideo a bit of anyone on the planet orteaches itself to run a robot that canfold cloth which let me tell you isreally hard and it's one of the reasonsthat humans have been doing sweatshopswith sewing machines and it's going totransition to robots that's a differentissue but umall of these things are based on reallyfour big breakthroughsyou have llms and you have diffusiongenerated images generative AI forimages those two things really in thelast five years you have a really coolpaper um the tension is all you need youhave some very cool things there'sreally two breakthroughs for that butthen we also have reinforcement learningand deep learning convolutional neuralnetworks and that in the 90s what I wasgetting my PhD I was all excited aboutbecause it was clear those twobreakthroughs were going to totallychange the world okay it took a coupledecades but now we're here and we'reseeing it totally change the worldTesla's about to roll out a car thatdoesn't have any human programming fromthe cameras all the way to the steeringwheel it's pure neural networks this isan interesting time we are alive inright nowI love love the answer to just uh to forthe audience the the work that youmentioned with Go is is a deep mind uhyou know Google deepmind the attentionis all you need paper one of the one ofthe co-authors of that founded anotherprotocol called Nia so Google has beenaround and involved in in these spacesfor a long time and I think our you knowappetite now with with web3 and AItogether is where we're trying to helpfolks like yourselves and our customersso with that Ai and web3 connectionwhere do you think we're going here isit AI for web 3 or is it web3 for AI andwe'll ask the whole panelist thisquestion but we'll start with you lemonokay so some people say there is nointersection at all or you could saythere is an intersection and if there isis it AI helping web3 be better or is itweb3 helping AI be betterI think that overall we're mostly goingto see web3 helping AI now there's alittle bit hey I can help web3 you canhave ai kind of looking at smartcontract code and looking for bugs orlooking at the code of the validatorsthemselves they're looking for bugs butthat's just tooling and it's sort of AIis going to help the whole universe andit helps that too it's not really AIhelping web 3. it's going to be tooexpensive I think to have the L1 Ledgeritself running gigantic neural networkmodels to do something you want to bepredictable anyway so I really thinkthat AI won't be helping web 3 as muchas web3 will be helping AIright now the biggest concern in AI oneof several gigantic concerns is the datathe training data it's only as good asthe training data you get biases becauseof training data and you have copyrightissues because of training data peopleput training data online for free andthen the AI people use it and then theycomplain wait you used my my datawithout permission but you put it onlinefor free and now my logo is appearing insome of your generated images oopsthis is an issue and I think in the longterm what we really need to do is haveeveryone who's providing data digitallyassert this is reliable data if youtrust me you can trust my data and givepermissionshere is who can use my data for their Aiand under what circumstances and do Iwant a royalty payment or not and thenmaybe every time you use this system theAI system you pay a millionth of a centroyalty payment to that personokay that's just totally impractical ifyou have to write them a check it justit's it's totally impractical but withweb 3 you can automate this and youcould actually pay them a millionth of apercent every time someone uses it andyou can actually record theirpermissions on how you can use theirdata and when they change it you stopusing their data because they took awaythe permission so I do think that justas web 3 is going to change every aspectof society it's going to change AI aswell and maybe the data and the paymentsof royalties is a big part of it lovethat Arthurare a couple of things so in terms ofwhat's enabled this is yes it's been auh there's been decades and Decades ofworking AI but there's clearly been ahuge acceleration in the past coupleyearsand if I had to distill I would say thekey Insight here yes the attention paperand a Transformer architecture has beenuh extremely important because itallowed to paralyzed training so youcould do training at massive scale buteven more important than that if you hada let's say to keep like one Insight Iwould say it's been the scaling curvesand a scaling curve uh which I would sayyou would probably create opinion eyefor for discovering they've come fromlooking at models and growing the sizeof the model and trying to see how wellthe model is going to predict text or orany other um aspects as you make itbigger and and they started noticingthat the scaling curve was actuallyholding through many orders of magnitudeand at that point that's where you'resaying like wow maybe we should do atraining run and spend five milliondollars on compute for for training thisthing and and this was something thatthat was very umvery uncommon uh this was an ERA where Iremember when um some of the firstreally impressive deep learning resultscame in Envision with Alex Knight forexample like people were of the mindsetthat a deep learning model was somethingyou would train on on a GPU as uh youknow as in in just one machine and theidea of spending so much in compute wasand heard of because we didn't reallysee that it could actually get you tosomething very very uh very powerful sothat I think is a key inside and likewhen people have realized that nowthey're saying like Okay let's dotraining runs with tens of thousands ofgpus uh listed on petabytes of internetdata and that I think is it really is akey Insight that um that turns thingsaroundin terms ofwebstery and Naian intersection it's I I think you seethe Empire by side you know the twotechnologies and you are going to seesome Western project and they're goingto have some AI component somewhere freecomponent I don't think that necessarilyput 10 Shades themselves uh very muchlike Lehman said you don't want to bringum like a fuzzy uh artificialintelligence inside your Ledger you knowyour Ledger is accounting you don't wantto be creative with accounting you wantto be very very predictable and and andand and and very straightforward thereare areas where interesting but onething we didn't do is Define web3 uh andpart of what you know what is website so90 it's a marketing term and that's allright uh it's better words than cryptopeople didn't like the word crypto andalso I think crypto should belong tocryptographers right that's right solet's say uh let's say it's web free butif you have to this you know to go atthe essence of like whatum what has been trying to capture Ididn't you know it's worse is justmarketing at its best it's an approachto the web where communities are owningsome of the platforms that they uh thatthey contribute to uh and so a lot ofpeople have been thinking in terms oflike fan communities or Creatorcommunities or social mediaand one aspect of social media that hasbeen very centralizing in the past hasbeen Croatian uh collaborative filteringyou know you go on a social mediaplatform you don't want to seeeverything that's on the platform youwant a selection of that uh soalgorithmic feeds for example have beenvery uh very popular or search you knowfor for Google obviously like you wantto have a subset of all this informationand the approach to that has been wellone entity has all of the data and thenthey can train these powerful models onall this data and then they can curatesomething for you but now the thingsthey're going to create is notnecessarily always what you would wantas a user and if you are trying to youknow have a small community-owned uh uhplatform or like a collection of manyCommunity owned platforms you know whatdo you do for curation and those AImodels what they can do is they can docuration from content you can havecontent-based creation you can literallytake an AI have a look of the messageand ask you know is that something Iwould enjoy reading about or you knowdoes this movie seem interesting towatch you can do this directly fromcontent as opposed to just saying wellwe have you know 100 million users and50 million users like this so you'reprobably going to like it that changes alot I would say of the accessiblebusiness models for social media andthat I think in potential website so inthis instance it would be something likeAI doing something for uh for websiteand of course you know the smallerthings I've mentioned one of my favoriteuse case on titles was the um the art uhthe the art community uh and and thathas been you know like a our journey andart has been a big a big topic I thinkERG in music is going to be even biggerbecause Arts I would say that thecommunity around art is absolutely youknow fantastic but it's it's smaller butart is Upstream of culture and cultureis huge and culture has music andeveryone listens to you and collectmusic and so music AI is going to uh tocome around and this is where it gets uhreally interesting with the intersectionso I I don't think I wish theintercession was bigger because mybackground is also in AI so I'm not agood habit I I don't think it's like agiant Synergy that that there's air butdefinitely we're going to see bothTechnologies being used uh and excitedabout those wonderful we'll come back totraining data in provenance shortly butI'd love to hear your thoughts too yeahI mean um so my classical training isnot in a an AI rather embedded inbusiness models and what really makessense for the individual user that issitting in your seat what problem is theEnterprise trying to solve although I doagree with even said I think things likeFederated learning become much moreinteresting there's a lot more trust andAI benefits a lot from web3 but web3does also benefit from AI right you canhave developing a smart contract becomeit could become easier it can becomemore trustworthy there can be lessmargin for error and obviously less costand time to deploy a web 3 applicationwhich has been a lot of a pain point forEnterprise developers todayand so that's I think very powerful andsomething we're working on with withPartners in the space todaycan I say something controversial pleaseokay all right so all right he's notgoing to throw me off the stage now sowe have that I mean I think Ai and andyou know going off of what Arthur saidyou know web3 is this kind of massivedisruptive force it is a thisdecentralization component that youtalked about where the people are nowempowered to do things and no longerhave to be held handcuffed by theincumbents maybe someone that has alarge amount of data anduh and soyou knowwhen we have partners that come to us weask them you know what are some of thosechallenges that you're looking to solvewe had a very large media andentertainment company come to us and sayyou know we want to Market our movie butin order to do that we have to buy allthese ads and we get single digitconversion spent you know blew millionsof dollars and you know maybe a fewpeople walk through those uh thosetheater doors and so that's not anefficient use of capital for them andyou know it's not obviously greatoutcomes for anybodyinstead what they decided to do is cometo us and say hey can we launch a gamewhere people can engage with that gameand we can learn about who is interestedin playing this gamewe did thisum with NBCuh folks came and played a game for thisparticular movie launch and now NBCknows you know mo James Arthur Lehmanlike this type of game it's a Draculabased game it's and maybe we'reinterested in playingum or these types of fields and maybe wecan Market a movie cater to a Draculabased fanand so you have someone like NBC sittingin the background that's running theirown models and trying to understand howdo they more efficiently Target us asmoviegoers instead of buying millions ofdollars of ads they have much moreconfidence higher conversion rates andreduce the spend and improve marginsessentially and that's real worldsolution with AI and web3 today and wethink that's the most exciting thing forus and so you know a little bit of myfavorite use case uh going back to thatpoint extending that to ticketing wherewe're working with folks like DemiLovato and Pitbull on solving just thisproblem they don't want to go toTicketmaster where Ticketmaster owns allthis information very famously in courtright now so it puts all publicand they want to have these these youknow fans or these creators want adirect relationship with their fans andso how do they build that relationshipthey can actually Target again a muchmore they can work with us launch aticketing solution have thatrelationship directly with the fan goerthey have a wallet they have they knowwhat Mo has been doing in other placesas well and they can now start to drawinsights as to what they want to buildin terms of content in the future wherethey want to have shows and thenobviously use some sort of naturallanguage to query what outcomes thatthey might want to get and so thisextends into a quite a disruptive forcethat isn't again something happening inthe future it's happening right now andyou know if you guys are in your seatsthinking about whether you're on theEnterprise side how can you againimprove margins improve outcomes or evensell more tickets these are things thatI think the world's largest companiesare trying to solve today and we thinkthat's exciting at the intersection ofAI web3 so personally you've touched onthis topic of personalization as welllike understanding the customerCRM been around a long time intraditional Enterprise I'd like to go alittle bit deeper on this topic so doyou feel that the the role of web3 TheLedger the information that's there theexisting Ai and machine learningtechniques doesn't have to be llmsincidentally right that we can apply andhave been applying to all of the data wealready have how do these things cometogether and do you think that they area good fit do you think that there'ssomething net new hidden in thereum what are your thoughts we'll startwith Arthuruh yeah so I I guess it comes back topersonalization and the fact thatum the way we've done personalization inthe past has been launched withcollaborative filtering so you have alot of items and you have a lot of usersand then you say well you know a lot ofthese users like these items and youlike similar items so you probably likethese users and you know that's how umyou know Netflix will give you uhratings based on like what you like andthey see other people who like this likethat and for that to work you need to doit in a certain scale right you need tocentralize all of this informationum and to be able to produce that onceyou start looking at content directlyyou can have some things that's a lotmore fine-grained than this you canessentially have uh either agents orsystems which are loyal to the user andwhich can be customized to the user soit's not just about knowing about youspecifically but also knowing about whatyou want to see knowing about how youwant the system to behave like how youwant to be shown uh things and I thinkthat that flips a lot of the uh the thethe social media practices on uh ontheir headuh in terms of personalization I wouldsay that there's there's there'ssomething about enabling people to um tocreate content uh enabling people toparticipate and I would say that's athat's the main um that's some mainelement you get out of here one thing tobear in mind uh and just to to zoom outis like what is the technology at theend of the day you have energytechnology it'sum easily verifiable but fundamentallyit exists to solve one problem right itexists to solve a double spendingproblem if you don't have a doublespending problem a sad truth is youprobably don't need a ledger and that'ssomething that's often forgotten so youknow if we've talked about Supply ChainSolutions and there's it depends if weinterpret web3 as narrowly being aboutblockchains and dlts or if it's biggerthan that if we're talking about digitalsignatures for example so if you have awhole supply chainand you manage to digitize your entiresupply chain and you manage to say wellif you're going you know you're gonnalike scan this grades uh you will do adigital signature you do all of thatand then at the end of the day yesyou'll have a lot of benefit for doingthat and sure you can put it on ablockchain but that's not really whatyou know what's draining the value ofthe fact that you've digitized yourentire supply chain in the first placeright A lot of these trust uh componentsit's usually reallyum become important once assets arecoming to uh come into play and once uhownership actually changes uh changeshand so this is why I think thatalthough they are interesting use casesin in this area the ones which arereally about uh very customer centeringreally about users and and and how theycan get personalized experience orprobably I would sayum uh a stronger fit for the underlyingtechnology now one of the reasons wehaven't really seen all that much isbecause blockchains historically haven'treally scaled right so you'll see forexample uh ethereum to about that 12transactions per uh per secondevery time we've had waves of adoptionthey've hit the fact that the fees getreally expensive so historically there'sbeen this tension between centralizationwhere you basically use you know thesame systems of old with just a littlemore cryptography on top of them or youknow new system which are decentralizedand it's only in a recent year thatwe've seen technology enabling thisdecentralized system to actually scaleand process millions or billions oftransactionsamen yeah so how is AI going to bepersonalizing in our field I think thisis the same way it's going to bepersonalizing everything in our lifeso I've seen a company that builtsomething that runs on hedera or you islike a wallet for hedera where you talkto it to Jet gbt and you just tell itwhat you want to have happen and itfigures out what transactions would haveto make that happen on The Ledger andthen it shows you on the screen thetransaction it's about to submit and youapprove itum that last step is kind of importantyeah uh chat GPT is will lie it willhallucinate it will do horrible thingsto you but it's great for like what youwere saying filtering I think it's wrongwho cares it doesn't hurt you so whatyou want to do is be an assistant whowill say okay I think this is what youwant me to do now here it is in veryclear language not written by an AIclick yes or no on it that kind ofpersonalization is good and then you getsomething like Siri on your phone thatisn't terrible anymore it's more likethe computer on Star Trek that can justbasically understand anything you wantand do anything you want that kind ofpersonalization is coming for usersmaybe equally important is the same kindof personalization for the developersand engineers and Builders who arebuilding the systemso we have Engineers who will usecopilot for example which will writelittle Snippets of code they often arewrong but it saves time I've hadEngineers tell me on our team that whatthey'll do is they'll write a littlesnippet of code then they go back andthey fix the parts that are wrong andthen and that actually ends up netsaving you time so it can't do somethingyou don't understand because then youcouldn't check it it could only dothings you already know it can only dothings that you would have been able todo and it's pretty stupidbut it helps it saves time and I thinkwe're going to see more of thatwhat I'm even more interested in thoughlike one of the xkcd comic strips saidyou know in software engineering how doI put this we're not very good at whatwe docode has bugs and it happens all overthe place and we know this from our appsand our ledgers and our wallets down tothe operating systems and even the chipssometimes can't divide that was a longtime ago but we see bugs throughout thesystem the only solution is formalmethods where you actually have a mathproof that it's correct and a computerchecks your math proofspoiler alert that's really hard to doreally really hard to do people aredoing it but it's incredibly hard to dofor hedera we have the hashgraphalgorithm that we have a proof that it'sabft it's really secure asynchronousByzantine fault tolerant that proof iscomplicated and so what we did is it wasvery laborious it took a professor atCMU you know a year to do it but heended up putting it in the computer inCoq in a way that the computer couldcheck the proof and it proved it wascorrect and the next step now would beto take the code that implements it andhave the computer prove that it iscorrect or generated in a way that'scorrectthis is something that's being done in atiny sliver of the software industryright now but not very widely becauseit's incredibly expensive the cost perline of code is just through the roof Ithink AI may actually make thispracticaland there you don't have to worry aboutthe AI making mistakes because the AItries to make a proof and then you haveyour little program that checks proofsand it sees if it was right or wrongright and you know for sure it's rightif that little program says it's rightso I think customization for ourdevelopers is is going to be equally bigas customization for our users maybeeven biggerlovely answerum there's a there's a couple of thingsin in there that I I'd like to talkabout and we have approximately 10minutes leftum so some of the The Innovation that'sbeen taking place in the field has ledto uh the kind of unearthing of thingsthat were happening in the 70s certainlyin the 80s and 90s and we're beginningto see the the fruits of that laborcoming good now so when we talk aboutmulti-party computation we talk aboutzero knowledge proofs do you feel thatthese Technologies you know as we thinkabout data privacy in the context of AIhave some sort of synergies and how willthey support one another and I'll startwith Arthur and then we'll take it fromthere there's really interesting umtechnologies that that have been builtaround and and revive I would say aroundthe around blocks you know they're inlarge proof where where were known butthey were largely an academic tool theyweren't really being used for for manythings it all of a sudden they find likepractical use uh same thing with securemotorbike computation uh homomorphicencryption that being said if we'relooking at the intersection of dataprivacy and Ai and and currently AIS isis not very um it's not very soluble uhin data privacyum a lot of this solution involvinghomomorphic encryption or securemultiple computation in practice theyhave an overhead which is so high thatit's not going to be it's not going tobe practical you know it's like it'salready extremely computer intensive tocome to to uses large uh these largemodels if on top of that you're tryingto add like three or four of themagnitude of slow downum that will work so uh another type ofsolution that have been uh also exploreda lot by uh uh in the web series cryptoindustry has been uh trusted uhComputing so te secure Enclave sgx uhthere's a great thing about this and aterrible thing about this so the greatthing about it is like it's simple yourun on a machineum it's you know you can have it on acloud you can have iteverywhere and you have no slowdown andit gives user data privacy andeverything that you need that's a greatpart about it the bad part about itisn't it doesn't quite work today peoplekeep finding bugs in it and people keepfinding ways to exploit it I don't thinkit's I don't think there's somethingfundamentally wrong with the technologyit's because it's fairly new and peopleare banging on it and like finding theproblem but I think it's like in everygeneration is getting better and betterand if we see so we've seen cryptosolution based on those on the systemsand I think for data privacy and AIwe'll also see that where the model runsin a way that it guarantees that yourdata stays encrypted and is not revealedto anyone as you get the result fromyour family from your competition and infact you know likebefore another a Google moment I thinkif you're trying to do these things uhyour the Android Enclave is actually agreat way to do it because you canactually do uh machine learning inanother and click on Android phonebetter than you would be able to do thatuh with sgx for example on on a CPU sointeresting area here so that isinterested confidential spaces uh isGoogle Cloud's offering here based onAMD Sev um Lehman quick thoughts for meon this topic and then we'll get to mineprivacy is criticalum AI right now if you have to go to awebsite that runs a neural network foryou you have zero privacy regardlesswhat they promise homorphic encryptionwill be wonderful and solve it all and Ispent way too many hours many years agoworking on homorphic encryption now wehave it solved and no one can use itbecause it is so inefficient I'm notgoing to hold my breath to get homorphicencryption able to run giant neuralnetworks I'm just not going to hold mybreath on that however the good news isthat it takes the truly powerful neuralnetwork Hardware to train the neuralnetwork in the first place once it'strained you can run it on a much lesspowerful computer and there's even workbeing done showing maybe it's even ordermagnitude less powerful than we thoughtyou can get away with that's right and Ithink what we're going to see is thatyour phone and your laptop are going tohave more and more silicon devoted torunning neural networks and the only wayto have privacy with AI is you keep itwithin your own device and we're goingto see that and that's going to be veryimportantum and so I'm optimistic about privacy Ithink web 3 ledgers have a huge thing tooffer to privacy and I think AI willcatch up especially as the hardwarecatches up but privacy we have to haveprivacy let's not create a dystopialet's created Utopia we have to haveprivacy thanks lemon and so maysomething you and I have discussed inthe past around this topicum but perhaps linking this to the theapplication in the in the business worldis around identity credentialingum and so you know imagine this worldwhere you have in your wallet acredential which has your privateinformation but now we have the Siliconin your phone that can run the llmlocally for you and that agent ispermission to access your private datain your secure Enclave potentially onyour deviceum imagine it's an llm that you can askquestions for it to go and do thingswhat do you think about this possiblefuture and what are the businessapplications that you can imagine couldcome from thisI mean that these the answer to thatquestion is you know the possibility isendless and I think it createsopportunity and access for people thathave these devices essentially rightum as the software continues to becomecommoditized and available you'll seevast amounts of parties being able toparticipate in these systems whetherit's someone who wants to be a developeror someone who has a few dollars andwants to invest in financial markets aslong as they're available to them and soon that secure Enclave I might have allmy preferences that I want to share withthat deviceit could be now taking in publicinformation that's verified on chainsimilar to what you mentioned marketdynamics within you know what'shappening in NASDAQ or within the LondonStock Exchange right now based on myrisk appetite but and all my attributionthat I'm willing to share again with mydevice because it is secure I can sayhey built rebalance my portfolio and Iwant to be able to do that in real timeon a daily basis maybe because I'm crazyand I want to be a high frequency Traderbut I can be now that's kind of the coolthing about it and so you know you canimagine anyone can now participate in uhin financial systems and you know we'veseen some similar Trends with memestocks now they might these these peoplemight have much more resources in realtime to be able toyou know just participate and I thinkthat's very powerfulum extending that you know we're seeingagain these use cases actually come tofruition today whether it's someone likeFranklin Templeton who is tokenizing amoney market fund on our on our protocolto thinking about and seeing um you knowwhat Larry Fink and BlackRock has saidthey're moving forward with tokenizationefforts first starting off with thingslike a Bitcoin ETF but of course you canimagine creating you know financialinstruments you might be willing toshare information with your assetmanager now to get better products andso that you're now building a much moresymbiotic a better symbioticrelationship with the Enterprises andthe partners that you are you know uhwhoever you may be working with and soand and so that's kind of on the retailfacing side but I think equallyimportant will be on the B2B side okayyou have large Enterprises again thatare working that might be looking tosecure a supply chain for example andit's quite competitive because you'reout there you know trying to navigatewhat might uh you know make yousuccessful versus your competitor and ifyou have that information and again in asecure way are willing to share it youmight be able to againprocure supply chain in a more efficientway relative to your peers and lead toBetter Business outcomes thanks right sowe have a few minutes left thereanything you'd like to add on to the thebusiness use cases of this pointum so I'm thinking here you know if I ifI have a digitally signed document in mywalletI have a number of them I can pickfields of information and selectivelydisclose them to another serviceprovider and maybe not even have to givethem the raw information maybe just givethem facts about that information liketrue or falseum this this is you know when combinedwith an agent I feel that there's a lotthat an Nai agent who could maybe likehelp negotiate for me and give me thefinal approval at the end to Lehman'sPoint what are your thoughts on on thisand do you think that this is a realfuture or something that we we might notsee for a while I I think maybe ifyou're talking about agents and to to toum to specify a lot of the systems wehave now in AI that people may be usinglike trading PTum they're not very uh they're notlogistic you know they answer questionsthey don't go out in the world and dostuff right uh and people have hackedthem together to be a little moreeigenetic by saying like hey you knowhere's how you make a request to theinternet here's how you go through myemail and it source of work but itdoesn't quite work very well but I thinkit's going to come it's going to getbetter and if you think of like peoplehaving a bunch of of AI as agents uh andthe agents are trying to do things withyou well they're going to be able to dothings the apis uh but it's interestingbecause if you want to have a contracttoday uh it's not very convenient tohave a counter you need to be a legalperson you need to be you know within aa specific uh uh legal framework youhave the contract sign in and how do youenforce it is slow so if you have abunch of AI agents who actually want todo contracts with each other uh it'sreasonable to use a Smart contract it'sa much more reasonable technology to useor even make a make a payment it's notimpossible they could go and sign youcould go and sign up for you know a uh apayment account be some payment providerbut again you need like a legalpersonhood if you want to do all thosethings so maybe they do it on yourbehalf but it is much faster and easierto just you know use a cryptocurrencyfor making your payment use a Smartcontract it's there it works and it'smachine accessible as opposed torequiring this notion of legalpersonhood uh so that's I thinksomething we might uh we might seeI think in business we're going to seethat as ledgers tokenize everything andstart to create little markets soinstead of my factory buying suppliesfrom one supplier that I have ayear-long contract with I buy I have anactual market for the parts and in realtime it's constantly buying them ledgersmake this possiblebut then you could have ai helping menegotiate well in that little tinyMarket that was created just for thesuppliers of my factory and I think wemay see more and more of that as we getdistance remediation and as we get morepeople involved with web 3 making itmore open to people it also makes itmore open to people who are using an AIto help them navigate these Waters we'regoing to see bothanswer say thank you all for listeninghopefully you found this insightful andinformative and thank you very much toour three panelists Mo Arthur and Neimanit's a pleasure having you here with usthank you very much thank you thank you[Applause]"
