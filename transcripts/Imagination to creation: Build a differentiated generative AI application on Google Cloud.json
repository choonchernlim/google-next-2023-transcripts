okayI guess everyone's a little tooMillennial noanyways hello welcome uh today we'redoing imagination of the creationbuilding a differentiated generative AIapplication with Google Cloudwe have our teamhi everyone my name is JC I work at ipsosay Global Market Research company andI'm the global head of grviokay hello everyone my name is HoltSkinner I'm a developer advocate forGoogle Cloud focused in artificialintelligence and machine learning andI'm based in Austin Texas and my name isJosh I am one of the product managersworking in vertex Ai and we're here totalk aboutwe're going to go through today adeveloper Journey showing you someoverview of what we're doing lately withvertex AI more specifically we'reactually going to solve a real userproblem or customer problem and we'regoing to go through a developer journeyand show multiple ways in which we'resolving this from a more built or out ofthe box all the way down tocomponentized and heavy developmentapplication orientation and then we'llgo through a little bit of details aboutwhat that looks like under the hood inour Solutions and the nice thing abouttoday is everything's going to be a livedemoI hope it doesso in short if you're not familiar thisover here is a nice little overview ofwhat we're doing in vertex the reasonwhy we're showing this is because at thetop here we have some AI Solutions getpeople familiar with things like contactcenter AI or document Ai and otherSuites that we have that are a littlemore pre-built still allows you tocustomize tune so on and so forth wealso have under here we recentlyannounced GA for search and conversationas capabilities and also more pre-builtflows and then we have our core AIplatform and under this we have modelGarden which is all of our models thatwe're offering so this is a kind ofbrief overview and sort of anunderstanding of how you can keep goingdeeper and deeper into the stack tobuild your solutionand with that we're going to be able totalk about our customerproblemsum so thank you everyone for theopportunity to share a little bit ofdetails of our generative AI Journeywith Google cloud and more specificallya high liver high-level description of abusiness problem we're trying to solveum just to set the stage I work at amarket research Global Market Researchcompany we have over 19 000 employeesacross 84 plus countries and there is astrong momentum around General AI withinmy company with teamstesting new ideas building prototypesand finding new ways to create andcapture value across the four categoriesof use cases that you see on the screenwhether it's discovering new insights orsympathizing summarizing large purposeof data or creating content to enhancethe delivery of insights or automationwe have literally hundreds of use caseswe want to go through and it feels likethe list increases every weekumif now let's bring the conversation downone level and let's focus on let's talkabout the use cases we're prioritizingin the short termwe are testing vertex AI search in twoof those use cases one of them is themulti-source insights and the other usecases is about a virtual assistant foremployeesto find questions to their most commonquestions and find the right documentsas they join the companyone of these virtual assistants iscalled ask ipsos our objective which askeeps us is to improve the experiencethe onboarding experience of newemployeestohelp them navigate what might feel likea complex organizationfirst by providing a low friction alwayson chatbot assistant who is an expert inour institutional knowledgenow the biggest challenge that we haveto deliver on that uh business problemis that our institutional knowledge ishyper fragmented across many data siloswhether it's internal Wiki sites orinternal chats or collaboration sites orjust share documents being passed aroundover email or we have a lot ofinstitutional knowledge spread acrossthe company and it's very difficult tofind the right answer to us sometimessimple questionsso we want to make us keeps us the go-toplace for new employees to find answersto their most common questions and findthe right documents uh without having tointeract with another colleaguethe the reason I I believe uh vertex AIsearch is a good match for this use caseis because it allows us to focus on theemployee experience by abstracting awaythe the complexities of ingesting dataindexing documents managing the vectorstore and whatnot all while providingthe Privacy security and governance thatwe've come to expect from Google Cloudnow our definition of success well itbegins withuh we want to leave behind the old dayswherea new employee will have to send anemail or a chat message to a colleagueto find an answer to a question and thenwait what sometimes feels like a verylong timewe want them to be able to interact withus apesos for thatsecondly we want to provide high qualitysearch results to our colleagues ideallyin the first results page and allow themto find the right documents that theyneed within the first group of resultsand finally thinking more strategicallyI believe that having an easier accessto our institutional knowledge willprevent in the long term Globaldistributed teams from Reinventing thewill and doing duplicative work if theyhave the if they find the right answerif they find the right documents thenmost likely we will not be reventing thewill the will over and over againnow with that said I do want to pass itback to Joshso here we're going to go through thedeveloper Journey on a couple of theseexperiences that we're able to make doyou want to get ready for the demos yeahand Holt is going to help us by actuallyshowing us some really awesome demosthat we built along the wayso we're going to start from the bottomup and kind of take that chart inReverse for a secondum one of the areas that we want tohighlight here was vertex gen AI studioif you haven't seen this is an area inwhich you can be able to get a simple UIinterface and experience in two modelsuh what is really interesting hereis that as you can see this little GIFthat's planned if you can't see in theback apologies for its small text wehave people who are actuallyexperimenting with an llm at the momentand being able to give some inputs andprompts and be able to start doing sometuning of the parameters around whichthey wanted to be able to respond on andit's a very simple UI to start playingexperiment to understand what we havethe reason why this is really cool isbecause this gets paired with vertexmodel Garden which is a One-Stop shop tobe able to get your Google and opensource models that are ready to use tuneand such right out of the boxwith this you can be able to use thisfor foundation models directly you cantune your foundation models customizethem and you have API access the testspecific Solutions so the whole pointhere that we're showing is that there isright at the very beginning an access tothe model layer to be able to startbuilding your application on top ofwhichever application you havemore specifically though we actuallystarted building some demos where weactually start showing the applicationthat we asked here for assesum today we have here Vector searchwhich is formerly known as matchingengine if you've ever seen this beforeand it is a highly scalable managedVector service the build your own searchrecommendation and so on and so forthimagine uh having a nearest neighborscalable engine and suchum what we're showing here is areference architecture because thisone's very bad built and you can see theembedded index that's essentially goingto be Vector search here with some otherpieces that we add here such as palm andsome apis that we can be able tointerface with it and some areas fromyour document database and such for whatwe're about to show you the wholepurpose of this is because it's highlyhighly scalable it's pretty easydocumentation interface with some moreupdates coming over the next couple ofmonths for this and make it moredeveloper friendly and it has Enterprisegrade security and compliance it can beused for a whole variety of use casesnot just for search and informationretrieval but information securitymultimodal search recommendations so andso forth so with that I'm going to pauseand hand it over to pulse who's going tobe able to show us a pretty awesome demoof that's actually running yes helloeverybody so today we're going to take alook at three different search andinformation retrieval tools using a setof documents for cloud developerrelations onboarding to the job that Ido well I have to be careful about thatso we want to be able to show you thevarying levels of control andabstraction that you can use whenbuilding your applications so we'llstart first with vertex AI Vector searchwhich gives you the ability to configureeverything end to end and this can workpretty well whenever you have theresources and expertise to create anduse your own embeddings or if you havespecific tools that you want to use forvarious steps in the pipeline so I'mgoing to show you a sample applicationthat was actually created by mycolleague Daniel Rodriguez that uses afront end on Firebase document AI fordocument optical character recognitionPalm 2 long large language model andvertex AI Vector searchso if I can get into my machinehopefully the Wi-Fi is going tocooperate today we shall see so this isa simple little application that buildsa question answer system specificallyfor employee onboarding of developerrelations so one of the first things youmight want to know about this is saywhat is devrel or developer relations soit says developer relations is thepractice of building and maintainingrelationships with developers devrelteam's responsible for educatingdevelopers better company's products andservices helping them to integrate thoseproducts and services into their ownwork we also work on building acommunity developers around companiesproducts and services and to helpdevelopers to solve problems and learnfrom each other and this is all all theactual matching is done using theapproximate nearest neighbor algorithmwith vertex AI Vector search and thenall of the user input and output are fedthrough the Palm llm to give kind of anatural language response of this solet's try something else on this one ofthe big things about developer relationsIs that we go to conferences so maybe Ishould askwhat first party conferences if I canspellshould I go toand here we go so first partyconferences the ones hosted by Googlethese include Google Cloud next which weare at right now Google I O and Googledevelopers live which is part of GoogleI O and Google and Google Cloud nextokay so let's move back over to talk alittle bit of vertex AI conversationokay can we switch back to the slidesplease thank youI'll pause here for one second becauseyou just saw a whole lot from Holt butmostly short this is an overview of thereference architecture to Holt was justshowing that they created for theirapplicationso that was quite a bit of worklet's go up the stack a little bitone of the other options you have hereis vertex conversation where you canbuild a dynamic and personalizedconversational experience quicklytraditionally called these chat Botsthis is sort of I'm awesome chatbot inthis some pretty awesome benefits youget from this multimodal chat voiceimages so and so forth generativeresponses combined with deterministicbusiness logic so you can imagineeveryone in a contact center or callcenter to be able to fall back when youhave clear Rules of Engagement oractions that you want being taken andnot just having the LM try to interpretpeople take transactions and automateactions with workflows and generatorsand so the Bots could start takingactions on your behalf you might haveseen some of the store in our demosduring the keynote yesterdayand then also low code bot Builder andbeing able to set up your Bot your flowsand so on so forth there's quite a bitmore behind this but this is some prettyawesome highlights that you get here andso we're going to show a demo where wetook the same information underlineinformation for ask ipsos in thiscontext in terms of being a developerrelations and showing you how weinstantiated with this demo as wellokayso here we're going to show an exampleoh we need to flip over yeah we're goodso look at an example chat bot builtwith vertex AI conversation and thisallows you to build a chatbot that cananswer questions based on specificdocuments that you upload and then youcan manage all of it in dialogflow CX soyou can also access other latestfeatures of dialogflow CX likegenerators and generative fallback okayexcellentI'm in the dialogflow CX console you canactually access the bus that you createthrough the the vertex AI console andthen it opens it up in dialog flow herethis is using the exact same set ofdocuments that we use for that Vectorsearch demo here let's say I want tolook at some different kind of insertinformation here something that's reallypopular for developers is labs andHands-On guides that give you a niceeasy way to get started with a productso let's see if I should ask it whatkinds of toolscan build labs for Developersvery nice so hopefully this is bigenough so everyone can see it I can tryand zoom in a little bit here we gonice so in this case it gave me ananswer based on some documents that havealready been uploaded into this thetools that can build labs for developersinclude quick Labs codelabs GitHubJupiter notebooks Google Docs and Neo'stutorials pretty cool here so what if Iwell you know code Labs that's a termthat maybe not everyone is familiar withso what if I asked itum whatlet's see or how do I make a code laball rightand here we go it actually gives me abunch of links for exactly how to thehome page for them how to author themusing Google Docs how to use them authorthem using markdown the formatting guideall that kind of information and so allthis takes just a few minutes to set upall you have to do is basically give alink to the documents that you're goingto use and then vertex AI conversationwill go through and read through allthose documents you give it or thewebsites or the structured data and thenit builds the spot around it so that youcan basically just go in and askquestions you know right away after it'sdone indexing so let's take a look let'sgo one further step up the stack andtalk a little bit about vertex AI searchforeignis this working nice and then lastly wehave vertex search which was alreadyalluded to in the very beginning as thechoice of implementation or solution fors ipsos in the context you get an out ofthe box personalized search to answercomplex queries and grind on your datasome of the other really cool aspectsthat you get with this generativeasomerization citations alone promptmulti-turn and you're seeing an exampleof this here where a user is able to putin not only search terminology but beable to file with following questionsand it retains context over themulti-turns customizable at the mlmodels and embeddings and in therankings itself grounded on unstructureddata websites and structured data andthen data connectors access controls andEnterprise compliance so this soundsreally close to what JC was saying thatthey really needed for their acidsourcing people to get internalinformation and so we can also show youa demo of the same data again runningwith this sort of instantiationbeautifulokay can we go back to the demo screenpleaseyeah so the last one that we're going tolook at hereis for vertex AI search and this is kindof the highest level of the stack soessentially it gives you you know notquite as much controls not as many uhbuttons and whistles as you can do withvertex a vector search but the idea isthat it's really easy to get set up andstarted so you can ingest websitesstructured data or unstructured datainto a search engine and within minutesyou have something that you can deployand use in your applications ready to goso I'm going to literally just gothrough the process here of how tocreate the how to create one of these soyou can see how you know how quick andeasy it is to set this sort of stuff upso I am currently in the generative AIapp builder section of the Google Cloudconsoleand so I already have a few searchengines here set up but if I wanted tocreate a new one I can just go here tonew app and I'm going to try and zoom ina couple of clicks just so you can seeit betterso in this case I'm going to select thetype of app as search if you want tocreate a chat app you could just do thisone or if you wanted to do somethingwith content recommendations you coulddo that as wellokay we have a few different featuresthat are available here we haveEnterprise Edition features Advanced LMfeaturesso I'm going to call this one cloudonboardingthen select a region in this case I'mgoing to use a global regionand then I can go in here and create anew data store and this is where I'mactually going to upload my data forthisand in this case I'm going to use somedata in cloud storagein this case all I have to do is providea cloud storage link to the data I wantto ingest this is all unstructureddocuments which includes PDFs HTML plaintext there's also preview options forMicrosoft Word docs and PowerPoint aswelland if you were going to be using one ofthe third-party connectors it's going tobe available for vertex AI search andthe rest of vertex AI you could also addthat in here at this timeso continue I'm going to give quick namefor this this will becloud onboarding documentsand then select this data store andwe're going to create our search engineand then that's pretty much all that youhave to do for the actual configurationpart now it's going to take a little bitof time to index these documents but youknow in True TV chef style I have onethat I made earlier to you know becausewe don't want to sit here and watch thisthing index so once you actually havethis open here there's a little previewwindow that you can actually go in andtest this out so what if I asked asimilar question to before such as whatis devrel and we can also see here howthe foundation models under the hood canprovide some different results dependingon which implementation you're usingherein hereso what is devrel devrel's a team peoplewho work developers to help themsuccessfully adopt Technologies they dothis by creating outbound content suchas blog posts videos and code labs andby delivering developer feedbackinternally so when you do have a highlevel of control like you do with aVertex say a vector search your resultsmight differ depending on which exactmodels you choose to use or how theactual matching happens under the hoodso something else really neat you can dohere with vertex AI search is that youcan ask follow-up questions and it usesthe context of the previous question todictate its next response so what elsedo they dohere we go devrel also builds demoswrites code speaks a developerconferences and meetups like I'm doingright now and gives Deep divepresentations to customers and getsfeedback from external developers sothere we go we have some nice answersabout this sort of stuff so now what ifI wanted to forget the context ofalready done and I want to ask a brandnew questionyou know who next can get very busy forfolks inside and outside of Googleanyone who's working with Cloud shouldknow thatum and so what if I want to ask how do Imaintain work life balancehere we go to maintain work-life balanceyou should disconnect from Google aftera day at work don't monitor email turnoff notifications or simply log out ofyour email program you should also blockup time on your calendar for focusedwork no meetings time and communicateyour working hours with yourstakeholders sounds great so probablytaken a little bit of a little vacationtime on thison this but you disconnect from all thisnow something great hereit not only gives you this actualresponse but it gives you all of thesearch results specifically thedocuments that were used to generatethat response in a sense this kind ofeliminates the issue of hallucinationsthat you can see with large languagemodels because it only generates thatanswer up there based on the documentsthat you give itso with thatlet's see here I just wanted to go andshow you a couple of the other settingsyou can make with it you can edit withthis so this right here is a pre-builtwidget that you can easily copy andpaste into your application there's afew settings you can enable in this youcan do search of follow-up search orthat answer enable or disableautocomplete enable feedback for examplethe end users can say this is a goodanswer this is not a good answerand the actual integration side of thisif it will loadniceso we actually have this pre-builtwidget here that you can copy and pastedirectly into any HTML site and then itworks automatically out of the box andit looks exactly like what you seeright here it'll give you just a nicelittle box that you can click on andit'll open up this in the full screenview so that you can use this kind ofpre-built search engine right on yourpage now if you want to do somethingmore customized then you can use theclient libraries which will show you thelink to that in just a secondand you can build your own UI on top ofit but this gives you a nice quick wayto get started and get something up andrunning so excellent let's move backintothe slidesso everything we're showing here you cancustomize and instantiate in your ownapplication in any which way you'd likethere's apis available obviously you canbuild on top of all this the US are hereto speed up understanding how to use thetools and such but obviously this ismore entirely back-end services andinfrastructure that we're offeringthrough vertex so what we're going to gothrough real quick is a couple reallycool highlights that kind of help thelinear differentiate between thedifferent solutions and ways that youapproach that we put in here but allthis is coming with vertex and isinteroperable with the differentservices that we just showed youso the purpose of what we're trying todo here just to ground everyone no punintended is that we're building stuffout of the box for any Loco developersbuilding software application developerswhere you can customize and buildingstuff very deeply for the mlaipractitioners and building your ownmodels building your own tuningembeddings so and so forthwell we're additional here was thesearch and conversation that weannounced the gathis looks really complicated the showthe purpose of this is to make it reallysimple that we've already built many ofthe flows the infrastructure the backend that's required to be able to dothis well scalable controllable insidewhere you can be able to put in a wholebunch of different input information beable to orchestrate across with ourconnectors grounded in extensions whichwe'll get into in a few minutes to beable to get your outputs for your usersand consumersone of the things that we just touchedon here was Data connectors announcedhere at the conference data connectorsin this case we've already had cloudstorage bigquery and we've launched inpublic websites and being able to goCarl and query and public websites we'realso announcing 3p services today withSalesforce jira and confluencewe're adding more to this actually quiterigorously over the next six months aswell and this is going to be open tobeing able to build 3p services so it'snot just stuff coming directly fromGoogle we have partners that arebuilding for this and we have it open ina way that you can also build your ownconnectors for any bespoke internalsystems that you already have and havecreatedgrounding is incredibly important peopleprobably see in about llms andhallucination and one of the things thatwe're doing with search as an examplebut not the only example is we'regranted on all of your local data what'sreally cool is the way that we're ableto also combine this with web data withllm knowledge so and so forth so here'sa really simple example if you're notfamiliar with grounding you can have aninput prompt here that's saying explainwhat 401K benefits and contributionlimitand the model output is going to say for2023 you can contribute 2 000 22 500 toan individual company will match 50percentup to eight percent of your contributionwhich sounds very generousthe way that I didn't write this by thewaythe way the reason why this is importantbecause we highlighted here is that someof this is coming clear from internalcompany information in the yellow hereand in the yellow we're actually showingover here that vertex search is actuallygoing in and looking through yourdocuments within the company that's beengiven access to and provided secure uhyou know understanding of and it sayshey I already understand how much mycompany will match on that but I don'tunderstand the Federal Regulation andthe changes that happened for 2023. soin this case they're also combining thiswith a public search that they puttogether and having all this data aspart of the Enterprise search experienceand then one of the other parts that wealso were mentioning and here isextensionsum and this is one of the reasons why wewant to bring this up because thedifference between connectors andextensions think of connectors isreading data bringing data in syncingdata extensions are more like takingactions uh working with 3p systems andso on and so forthum examples here is we have stuff that'sbeing built by Partners doing itbackwards we have the stuff that'sintegrated with Google and we showed alot of this in yesterday's keynote andwe're also leaving it open so you canbuild your own again for custom internalsystems have been created for theEnterprise or for things that just havenot been supported yet but is of highpriority for yourselfin doing this you'll be able to say thatit had prevents uh for data lossprevention compliance on ability andexplainability because this is all beingdone in a holistic systematic way andthere'll be more information coming onthis over the next six months as wellthis is not just for the searchingconversation just to be clear this isfor everything that's being happening invertex and be able to extend modelsthemselves and so and so forthand then the last thing here becausethis comes up a lot this also looksreally complicated well I'll talk aboutmodel customization a lot of people askabout tuning trying to create their ownllms so and so forth there's a wholerange in here that you can be able toactually do thisum some of this for people who've beenin mlai for quite a while now totallyunderstand the overhead and thecomplications and the costs of trying totrain models and so what we have isRight prompt design which essentiallysaying just use the models right out ofthe box start managing your prompts andyour inputs to be able to get the bestresults that you that you're looking forand this is actually highly effectivefor many different purposes includingwhat we were just talking about beforemulti-turn where we're keeping contactsfrom the previous input so and so forthin this we have adapter tuning which issimply saying that we can create anadapter model the purpose for this isthat you can keep your data private youcan keep your data totally without usever seen it in our instances in ourpolitical clients and that data canseparate from the overall modeluh reinforcement learning human feedbackis a new thing that we announced withVector vertex Ai and that is an areathat you can update your weights modelsreward as you can see this startsgetting more green which basically saysyou're you're now changing the entiremodel it's starting to tune the wholething and then you can do a full finetuning if if permits or is needed foryour use case we support all of thisincluding compliance and security andsuch we're not covered in the sessionbut things like dedicated instances andso on and so forth are also being madeavailable depending on securityrequirements and latency and suchso the purpose of today's conversationwas that we took one use case in generalthere were actually many use cases thatwe're seeing a lot of Great Value that'sbeing added in the tools that we'reburning this is just a small subset ofthose uh to be clear but we want tohighlight that what we just showed todaycould be reused to build any of thesetypes of use cases using your data beingable to be specific for your Enterpriserequirements and it's not just fromcompliance but also from the use caseand I should be able to meet therequirements to fulfill the End customerneedsso last one this looks reallycomplicated but in short we went fromthe small chart that kind of gave me areally brief overviewto a little bit more of an extent I'mgoing to walk through what we just kindof did of some of the solutions at thetop here we have in here our search andchat and we talked about how we'reorchestrating across all those alreadyfor you as the customers and thedevelopers we're giving you a lot ofcontrol in addition to the dataconnectors grounded in extensions to beable to customize and tune for yourneeds and then we have our core platformareas here where we have our modelgarden with our first party open sourceand partner models as well as all thetraditional mlai notebooks and trainingjobs and so on and so forth thereso with all that said Holt wanted tospeak to his demos yes of course so iseverybody excited to get started usingsome of this stuffhere we goso if you want to get started here Iwould highly recommend going to thislovely QR code here I promise it's notgoing to spam me anything so this willgo directly to this guide in thedocumentation uh you know we have uh getstarted with Enterprise search the oldname for for a text AI search becausewe're moving fast we're gettingeverything so this takes you to a lovelyvideo that it looks like there's someguy here that you know might want totell you a little more about this andalso one of my colleagues Kaz Satois an expert in bettings and all thatkind of stuff so he talks about the uhwhat's actually going on under the hoodwith semantic and keyword searching butso this gives you nice step-by-stepguide to go exactly how to create asearch engine for all the differenttypes of data it also gives you a nicewalk through in the cloud consoledirectly and so this if you just gothere it'll take you to this guy there'salso guides for how to create agenerative chat app generative AI agentswhich is the protects that conversationstuff we talked about so you can easilyfind all of this going on in therefor more resources here my team in Clouddeveloper advocacy has a full videoseries called generative AI fordevelopers and this gives you a niceconceptual overview of pretty mucheverything generative AI on Google cloudand this QR code just goes directly tothat playlistokay everyone got the everything takenpictures ofokay I'll give you like two more secondshere to do thatokay you can also Google search this tofind what you're looking forandfor all of the all of you who want tohave some sample applications to try andhack around with we have a GitHubrepository now the phones are reallycoming out everybody's really interestedwith this this is a GitHub repositorymaintained by my team that has a bunchof different sample applications Jupiternotebooks uh sample code demos and stufffor all the generative AI features ofvertex AI so we have a sample web appusingum using vertex AI search we have somestuff for chat we have some notebooksusing the Palm models Tech spice andchat bison Gekko we have some stuff forvision and image generation we havestuff for speech everything it's yourkind of One Stop Shop for any sort ofsample code relating to generative AI onGoogle Cloudforeign"
