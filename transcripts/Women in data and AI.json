before we begin though let'stake a moment to underline theimportance of this topicwe are in an era where data and AI areseen as a businessadvantage and having diversity ofthought in that data that we're feedingAi and machine learning algorithms issuperimportant it's important to reflect thetrue Society it serves as it becomesembedded in everyday life around ustouching how we work how we purchase andhow we communcommunicate yet research released by theworld economic Forum suggests womenaccount for only26% of all data and AI positions in theworkforce26% during the next 30 minutes we willexplore ideas on how to advance women toincrease diversity and AI development todeliver Equitable outcomes ourdistinguished panelists will share theirexperiences that have led them to theirchosen career Pathways they will sharehow they are influencing change withintheir ownorganizations and finally we willdiscuss viable calls to action fororganizations leaders and aspiring womenin data and

facingdigital touch points for the fifthlargest airline in the US she serves onBoards of multiple nonprofits andIndustry ORS welcome[Applause]leaders during the introduction we heardyour current roles and the places youwork but in your own words how did youbegin your career and dataanalytics who wants to gofirst I'm happy to go all right let's goso um when I first uh came out ofcollege and I had a computer scienceeconomics degree as as well I worked fora bank and we were in a sort ofmanagement trainee program where werotated through various departments anduh in one of the organizations that Iworked in this is going to date me butthis was in the 90s um there were uhprocesses that were taking place thathad a lot of inputs and outputs andapprovals along the way and it was superefficient lots of paper literally paperand um I you know had some very basicdatabase classes from school anyway Iwent out and bought a book on MicrosoftAccess and uh built an access databasetrue um and that was sort of where mypassion for data um first was born Iwould say within technology and then atIHG where I've been for 20 years um Istarted off as a Hands-On analyst and sothere was um there were pieces that Iwas working with data and I kind offocused on that that's just what I likedand then I became a developer Hands-Ondeveloper and then that has grown um tothe engineering team that I lead todaywow impressive impressive so quite a fewyears you kind of navigated your way andyou are where you are today for thatreason I would love to hear from Natalieand Grace as well sure so I um haveactually never held a data and analyticsjob title um my career I started inmarketing I have a business degree sothe need for Dad analytics has existedthroughout my career um but the the roleitself I have always leveraged from abusiness side and I've seen the valueand data and analytics to drive changeand and do new projects um that's greatand I know that your background is quiteunique because you come from marketingand you made them um change over I knowwe're going to hear a little bit moreabout that in our discussion Grace wewould love to hear from you yeah so uh II shouldn't really be here uh so similarto Natalie and you know I didn't Ididn't go into data and analytics onpurpose uh I was uh supposed to be achist uh I was really into music I'mvery right brained uh in fact anybodywho knew me as I was growing up they'reamused perplexed flabbergasted uh that Iam in financial services in a data andanalytics job they they think it's aFaceoff situation it must be someoneelse um but uh one of the things Ireally liked about data and analyticswhen I finally uh experienced it for thefirst time is it's a great leveler uhhaving information means that you haveseat at the table uh I I started mycareer in Consulting and Consulting isparticularly um this is particularlytrue in Consulting because you walk intoa meeting you're supposed to delivervalue and I know what I look like sowhen I go into a meeting room even nowpeople say who brought the intern andwhy is she speaking um and so but youknow as you go through um introductionseven in a Consulting environment theysay oh I'm so and so partner I have had30 years experience and that's why youshould trust me I've had 25 yearsexperience you should trust me so I'm inmy first meeting and I realize oh I'vehad zero days experience I don't get tosay anything but because I looked atfive years of data as part of that firstmeeting I had five years of experienceand people were interested in what I hadto say even though I don't look like atraditional expert so you know you catchthe bug and uh here I am but uh yeahpeople are very very very surprisedthank you for sharing Grace Natalie andBarbara we just really want to dive alittle deeper into your experiences so Ithink I'm going to move on to the nextquestion why does diversity matter indata and analytics I know you've livedit day in and day out through your ownpersonal experiences but now we'removing into algorithms we're moving fromdata and analytics into machine learningmodels so I would love to hear yourperspective I'm sure the audience wouldas well who would like to go first I'm Gto start picking I I can speak um Ithink that that diversity is reallycritical in anything related to datadata and analytics because it brings youa unique perspective and it removes someof the bias that exists particularly ifyou're dealing with people who've beenlooking at the same data for 20 to 25years they're going to have a really iningrained bias there and havingdiversity of thought and removing that Ithink really makes a huge difference inin changing the experiences that you candeliver before the panelists go can Ipull on that a little bit more because Iknow you come from the experience sideof things so having that diversity indata really representing the societythat you'reserving what is it that you're verymindful of when you're pulling theseexperiences together for Alaska AirlinesI think you have to be mindful of thefor us the guest experience which isreally critical because no matter whatthe data says we don't want to make adecision that's going to deliver a poorguest experience and so being theadvocate for the guest experience isalways really critical you also have tounderstand the business and so data andanalytics tend to focus on a smallerscope of information and and bringing inthat diversity of thinking about theguest experience thinking about thebusiness goals that we want to achieveit allows you to make better decisionsbecause you're adding in levels ofinformation thankyou so I I certainly concur with allthat and I think you know being herethis week everybody must be seeing thesame things I am right everything is Gengen and gen more gen ml is coin nowright like that's all yesterday's newsum and whilst I'm no expert by any meansit seems clear that there's going to bea a focus on the ethical use of AI andthe data that goes into it the data thatcomes out what an Enterprise does withthat data and the circular kind ofimprovement of the models and having thehuman voices there that bring thediversity of thought to thosediscussions and those decisions is goingto be even more critical than it hasbeen over the years for us to you knowbuild maybe a more traditional datapipeline in my my business um to havethe voices in the room uh that representdiverse schools of thought it just seemslike it's going to be all the morecritical um the human element is alwaysgoing to be there and we need to makesure that all of the humans are part ofthatleadership yeah I mean data andanalytics we talk about as a technicalcapability but honestly it's one of themost human things in the world I mean wecome to the planet fitted out withsensors Computing storage technology todo stuff with it I mean so we're we'reall in data and analytics uh taking aninformation processing it and making adecision uh that's why we havestorytelling uh you know I thinktherefore I am I mean it's it is humanum and the idea that we wouldn't havehumans and every stripe of humanrepresenting the way that we fit thisinto services or banking or some of thethings that support the way that we welive um it just it doesn't make anysense uh so um you know I think makingsure that people have access to itunderstand it um value it is reallyimportant um and I think with automationit becomes a little bit more terrifyingto not have it as part of our um the waythat we think about a problem and theway that we make judgment because uh youknow when there's human intervention youcan train humans and they can make maybefive mistakes at a time you you do itwrong in automation it's hundreds in asecond uh so we really do have to beextra mindful when we're moving at thiskind of pace and with this level ofmaybe aa fewer opportunities to fix um mistakesI think it's even more critical to makesure that people are thinking about theproblem in in multiple ways and andchallenging each other to to do itbetter I think it's interesting you saythat because when you think about Ai andml you're thinking about the data andthe analytics but as organization whatabout the cost Associated of redoingthings to make sure that you did go backafter the fact and looked at all thethat diversity inputs you asked theright questions G an organization Ithink that's one of the things that wedon't think about so I think that's it'ssomething we should be moving forward sothank you forsharing so now having said all that weunderstand that you know human is stillat the center of AI and mlwhat are some of the actionable stepsthat an organization can take to drivechange what are some of the things thatyou're thinking about that can helpother organizations learn from yourexperiences so I'm going to play alittle bit off of some there wassomebody that was going to be on thepanel today who she's got Co she wasn'table to be here but we had the pleasureof working with her over the last coupleweeks um there were a few things thatshe said that I think resonated with allof us and hopefully a lot of theorganizations in this room are doingthings um starting with uh employeeresource groups right like those arethings that um really bring to the tablesome of the diverse pool of resourcesand talent that you have um and forvarious organizations supporting theongoing career development of allresources and in particular here we'retalking about women and Technology umand giving them a path forward thatthat's something that as an organizationthat we wish to do um and part of thatis I think um having very clear goalsand making it something that is aheadline it's not just something that wetalk about as an afterthoughtso sure um so I I mean diversity isn't aday and it's not something that we cando in a panel or we can have an event oreven even ergs uh you know have theirlimits uh so I mean it's really aboutestablishing new norms and habits andthat's actions literally every day um soI I think the the we operate off ofreward systems so incentiv iing eitheruh formally or informally uh just makingsure that people are including otherpeople and that's the of of De and I Ithink I is obviously the most importantbecause it's action oriented um but umjust making sure that every project thatyou have every decision that's made uhyou know you are reaching out to peoplewho don't look like you don't think likeyou don't have the same experiences asyou do um and that that ultimately leadshopefully to a better discussion if nota better decision um and you knowwhether that's in including um women inthe workplace or in your teams or youknow some of the programs that we'veestablished around data ethics at thebank I think are ways for us to checkourselves and nobody intends to be ajerk nobody intends to exclude peoplebut sometimes we're just not in theright habits uh so you know again dataethics is a really important topic forthe industry but it's really easy topublish principles uh it's reallydifficult to make make people thinkabout it all the time uh so I mean we'vewe've tried uh by embedding it into ourprocess into our governance structuresour controls and um you know even in theuh creation of this kind of framework oror process we included a lot of peopleuh so it wasn't just risk or complianceuh that were designing this we actuallybrought in the data scientists uh and wemade them tell us what about it suckedso that we could fix it so that it wouldbe easier to adopt uh it would besomething that they valued and now whenyou talk to them it's very common forpeople to say Hey you added process tomy analysis what are you doing uh but infact we're finding that they're Thankingus because they said you know what I Inever would have thought of that and hadI published a model that had that biasin it I would feel terrible uh so it'sactually a really good way to you knowengage in the topic in a in aconstructive and kind of operational wayuh and hopefully that leads to betterhabits overallabsolutely I think from a Alaska'sperspective I'm lucky to work in a veryfemale friendly culture I'm here withfour other leaders and they're all womenuh and so I think finding a culturewhere that is less of an issue for youand you can really grow into it is veryimportant and they are out there andreally having that Clear Vision of whereyou want your project or to help thecompany go and repeating that Visionover and over and as you said that issuch a good leveler it does give you abetter seat at the table it gives youmore of a microphone but it's on you tokeep repeating that over and over sothat people really absorb what you'retrying to achieve and it takes a lot ofpatience to get to where you want to goum but it it you will getthere it's I mean just on on that sothat question was around what you theorganization can do to drive the changebut I think there's a big piece from anindividual perspective and um happy tosee see a lot of men in the room as wellas women and I think there are thingsthat um our male allies can do to helpindividuals women in day-to-day um Idon't know I've been in many meetingswhere I feel like I hear a voice in theroom who has something good to say andthey're talked over usually not me justthat's not the way I roll but it's soyou know that there there's voices thatare talked over and I think it'simportant to for everybody in the roomto stop and try to you know call out andsay hey it sounds like so so hadsomething important to say there andmake sure that their voices are heardand that's something that I would sayeverybody can do at an individual leveland in particular I think um againhaving male allies in the room that seethat and make that a priority so thatthat becomes normal and that thosevoices of some of the people especiallyin the technology space who maybe arenot looked at as the ones having the theknowledge are given the time to speakbecause they do so such such a greatPoint actually could we take a momentand just applaud all the men that havecame here to support ustoday so F our final question will bethat women often dismiss themselvesbefore even attempting a challenge toyour earlier point right because theydoubt their abilities and in some casesI know I've had this as I've grownthrough my career the impostor syndromewhich leads to a lack of confidence whatadvice do you have for other women whoare thinking about this field maybe aleader in this field and Men what can wedo to help them kind of move throughoutthis career in data andanalytics I I'll I'll go first um so I II I we really have to stop telling womenthat there's something broken about themum and I know we never say it explicitlybut every single woman related programthat I've been to is around speak upmore uh or speak louder or be moreaggressive or make sure that you'renetworking more um effectively be morenormal uh and that usually means male umand I I know that it'snot universally male but it is givingthe signal to people that they need tofix themselves and how could you notthink that there's something broken howcould you not think that you're animposter when people are constantlycoaching you so I would say that the thebest thing that you can do is just becomfortable in who you are and don'tlisten when people say you need to bedifferent it's it's like I I get veryvery passionate about this um but uh youknow there there are benefits to beingdifferent um being flawed means you'rehuman and you're empathetic um speakingless means you hear more uh it is veryimportant that we actually havediversity at the table and we can't dothat if we're training the diversity outof people uh so just because we lookdifferent we all behave exactly the sameit doesn't matter so I would encourageyou to just feel comfortable uh includeyourself your real self and stop tryingto be someone else because you're reallybad at being someone else you're greatat being yourself so it also takes a lotof energy to try and be someoneelse it I I think that you can spend alot of energy trying to pretend or fitin with a a different model of what astrong leader should look like and andfor me it's the work it's do the workthat gets you noticed and if the workisn't in your purview do it anyway begfor forgiveness later just make surethat you're always showing up knowingmore data you know if you know ifeveryone at the table knows three yearsmake sure you know five years you reallyjust have to make sure that you havethat behind because it really is I thinkleveler is a great word the equalityexists when you're going back to thedata and analytics um and so justleverage that but don't change anythingabout who you are I think I mean I'mwearing sneakers because I can um but Iyou know five years ago probably wouldnot have and I I think it's a reallyimportant especially in this space inTech men are not changing who they areto be comfortable in the tech space atall so women should definitely not yeahI think so it's about knowing your valueand there's value to be brought from Adiversity of uh resources and thoughtschools of thought um and notcompromising on that right that thethings that you bring to the table arethe things that you bring to the tableand that there is value in that umthere's certainly within uh technologyand data in particular there are so manyopportunities and you think I mean we'rehere at this conference for the womenand the men in the room what's the greatequalizer it's the line for the bathroomright I mean have you ever beensomewhere that there's a line queued outfor the men and then you I thought I wasin the wrong hallway the first daybecause I was like oh there's no women Iwas oh wait a minute you know you don'tneed to look at the 26% of Statistics toknow when you're at a conference likethis that there is a missing voice inthe room the collective room right umand so for all of the women who arelooking to you know do the next thingfor their career Etc is know your valueit'simportant great so I I had one thoughtand I wanted to get your opinion wenever talked about we never rehearsed itso it's okay if you feel like you don'twant to answer but one of the bestadvice I ever got and it was from aleader at Google he said you need yourpersonal board of directors you need apersonal board of directors who itselfis very diverse you need it from insidethe company you need it from outside thecompany you need it from all around whatare your thoughts on that because if Iwas to do that and let's say I wasearlier in my career what are the thingsI should look for as a woman in data andanalytics that could helpme could take a moment I know that one'sa just a fresh question yeah I can Ianswer so for for me in my careernetworking and having mentors has notbeen a huge driver so I think I'm in a arare position there and part of that iswhen I if I were to go build a board ofdirectors I have a very differentbackground there's no one who has abackground like mine that is going thedirection I'm going and so it makes itmuch more challenging to to find theright people what I have found to bemore beneficial for me is reversementoring soreally building relationships withpeople who are earlier in their careeryounger because they have such adifferent perspective about what ishappening and how things are going andso it's actually worked better if I wereto build a board of directors it wouldall be you know people 30 and under andand I think that you get just thatdifferent type of thought that'srefreshing yeah yeah interesting whatabout you Barbara I mean I absolutelyagree with that and I think there's umthere are many paths to kind ofachieving the things that we're talkingabout here today uh I I'm looking backand I remember we did many years agosome sort of assess a 360 a 360assessment where you got feedback fromyou know within the workplace and um Ihad in particular some feedback personsometimes it's hard to hear the feedbackEtc about some of the things and when Imet with and it was a woman a leader inthe HR organization um they paired youand had them review some of the thingsEtc and I was kind of Spun up about thethings that certain things um that weresaid and she said something that'salways resonated and I would put her inmy board of directors which isessentially you have to be yourself andso what you are is what you got wherewhere you are not everybody's going toagree with what you know the way you arethe way you think Etc and again I thinkit you know ties in with a Grace saidthat it you don't want a homogeneouspoint of view in any way shape or formand so the people around you that giveyou the feedback to make you comfortablein your own skin would be on my board ofdirectorsum as well as absolutely I think I willagain pull the threat on the male alliesI think that there's um you know leadersacross the organization that can helpgrow your career and then I think I'malso lucky at IHG we have a lot of verystrong women leaders um including mycurrent one and you know you benefitfrom that and so I I think part of thatis just knowing that if I had that boardwhen I was younger I would want to seethat and I would hope that I could bepart of that for other women as they'recoming up in their careersso yeah I think my experience is verysimilar to Natalie's I'm garbage atnetworking um and I have never onceasked somebody for a conversation letalone a mentoring um relationship it'sjust not how I'm wired and I did justspend a lot of time telling everybody tobe themselves um so I I think the whenpeople ask me you know how do you findsponsors how do you find mentors I Ithink there is a degree ofself-identification as somebody has tocare about you you can't just asksomebody to care about you um becausethey won't and they won't challenge youthe way that you need and they won'tgive you the support or the advice orthe you know sometimes harsh criticismthat will help you uh so you know I'vebeen really fortunate in my life uh tohave a bunch of people who raised theirhands and said hey that thing thatyou're doing you should stop or thatthing that you're doing you shoulddefinitely do more of and you know whenyou said that it really resonated withme um and you know without that andwithout them selfidentifying it it wouldn't have been uhquite as powerful even if they said thesame words when people care about youyou can feel it uh so find people whocare find people who care enough to giveyou harsh or constructive uh feedback umand you know recognize it for the giftthat it is but um don't don't stress toomuch about finding a certain number ofpeople or a certain type of person justfind people who genuinely care about youhave some degree of visibility into whatyou do you and what you care about andwho you are and have them hold youaccountable thank you so much forjoining thank you so much for[Applause][Music]sharing"
