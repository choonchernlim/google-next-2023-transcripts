customer engineer that'sbeen helping brain Corp in theiradoption of our shelf-checking AIproduct which is built on top of vertexAI which I'll talk about a little bitlaterMarine Corp is usingshelf checking AI with their robotsto scan grocery store shelves andultimately help grocery stores save timeand money which who doesn't love thatrightokayso John's gonna kick some kick thingsoffand he's going to talk about what braincore does he's going to coverthe migration from their previous cloudprovider to gcp he's going to talk aboutbrain Solutions as well as their latestsense product which they've come outwith and then following that I'll comeback up and talk about vertex AI sothank you John[Applause]thanks Chris day three hopefullyeveryone's energy is as high and excitedas mine is to be here and talk to you asChris mentioned I'm the director of ourCloud operations at brain Corporationand been really excited about the gcppartnership that we've had for the lasttwo and a half years almost three yearsnow working together to reallyaccelerate what brain can do andexcited to talk to you about thata little bit about brain Corporationwe're an automation company brainCorporationfocuses on robots helping people a lotof times robots have a stigma of comingin replacing jobs and we we valuehelping and putting robots alongsideindividuals in the workplacewe have two main use cases Chris alreadytalked around our sense product in termsof data collection in stores our mainfirst product we had was in floor careand cleaningand we really think of our robots kindof like the dishwasher of the 1950s andthe 1960s dishwasher came into theAmerican household and really freed uptime after the family meal the end ofthe night dishes still needed to getdone but now family could load thedishwasher and was able to spend timewatch a movie play a game have a littlebit more value time that they gettogether instead of having to stand overand slave at the dish at the sink allnight brain corporations a lot in thesame way of what we're trying to do withour robotsa little better by the numbersin the world in terms of deployed robotsoperating autonomously we have about 29000 robots that operate worldwidecleaning floors and helping to providedata collection in retail spacesin that we have executed about 10million hours of autonomy put that incontext that's about 1200 years worth ofautonomy that RR robots have operatedlonger than any civilization that manhas livedin those 10 million hours of operationwe've cleaned 130 billion square feet offloormyself I'm the big U.S football fanthat's about 2.8 million football fieldsworth of space that our robots havecleaned that's a lot of touchdownsthey've scoredso how are customers seeing and gettingvalue out of what brain Corporation isdoingcovid really changed a lot of thelandscape around retail and around whatour customers are doingcustomers coming into the stores wantclean spacescompanies coming out of covet are havinga hard time finding labor and laborcosts are risinghow can brain Corporation comes in wehave robots that can come in help makesure that floors are clean help collectdata around what's on a shelf and helpthe labor that they have currentlyexisting in their stores be focused onmore valuable tasks and spending timewith their customersso how does brain Corporation do thisour strategy and our approach to howbrain OS our main autonomy service isfocused is much like Android versusApple Apple wants to be completelyintegrated own everything end to endwe want to be a little bit more likeAndroid partner with Best in ClassPartners where things such as tenantDane Karcher nilfisk large companiesthat are really good at manufacturingand let brain focus on providing theautonomy software and the autonomySolution on top of that and then findBest in Class Partners on the other sidelike Google in their shelf Checker Aiand working with each customer in termsof their partners and how we integratelet brain focus and win where we do inthe autonomy spacenext I want to talk to you a little bitabout our journey to gcpwe made the decision three years ago toleave our current existing cloudprovider and move to gcp we'll get towhy we did that in a second butwe did some initial pocs looking atalternative Cloud Partnerships and Cloudenvironmentsand with the criteria we had set out inone alternative cloud provider took usabout a month to get set up be able torun up demo and validate some use casesand gcp was less than a week though itwas clear who was the right partner forus to move forwardinstead of doing a move and improve thenew term around lift and shift wedecided to do a full-scaleinfrastructure rewriteso that meant that it took a little bitlonger in our timelines than maybeothers but it took us a year untilOctober of 2021 and that we moved ourfirst cleaning robots over into our gcpenvironmentafter that in November we launched ourbrand new brain OS mobile applicationthat pairs alongside with our robotsand then things started to pick up speedby April of 2022 we had moved 8 000robots in all the operations over ontogcpthen we turned our eyes towards movingover our Shelf scanning workloads andfleets and in July of 2022 we beganmoving that workload and completed inSeptembertwo-year project to move all of ourrobot and Fleet Management andoperations and our entire company fromour previous cloud provider to gcpso why move what are the benefits whatwhat is brain getting and taking on atwo-year long project in this scalewell customer demandwe found that moving to gcp one of ourtop key customers we were in kind of abit of a competitive space for them andreally was a key initiative driver butwhen we started looking at gcp we sawthat nine out of the 10 top retailers inthe world were running on Google Cloudso there was definite Market spaceadoption that we could get by moving toGoogle cloud and leveraging thosePartnershipsrobots generate a lot of data and soGoogle when we think about them is worldclass at how they build Solutions arounddatarobots generate Big Data you need bigqueries to process those and so theirSuite of services around Google storagefirestore for mobile and bigquery forjust analytics really fit well with whatwe were trying to doand then lastly a lot of retailers takesecurity very seriously you're nowputting something operating in theirenvironment autonomously wanting toensure that data leaving that robotcoming to brains cloud and making it tothem is secure so the authenticationplatform and capabilities to ensurerobots talking to our backend systems aswell as the customers coming in andaccessing our web applications hascomplete Security around thatso what did we what did we get in termsof benefits here I can't talk enoughabout the benefits that we've seen inthe data tooling and and the uharchitecture that gcp offersthat their event and Pub sub-drivennotification systems and ability toseamlessly set up data pipelines andmove data through gcp has unparalleledthey're managed services and from ourLegacy environment we were doing regularhaving to do regular maintenance to keepour kubernetes updated updating variousServices trying to take in patches keepdatabases updated with Google Cloud allof my devops team can be focused more onhigher value thingswith autopilot updates to kubernetesoffice automatically happen zeromaintenanceleveraging bigquery features just rollout I'm not having to manage databaseversions having to keep it updatedscaling out scaling downlastly as we continue to discuss andinvest into our Google relationship wegot involved with Google's retail Ai andwhere they were going as well as what wewere trying to do in the retail spaceand we've been successful in over a yearnow developing alongside with shelfchecking Ai and being in on the groundfloor and building that outsome key learnings along the waychanging Cloud environments requiresorganizational shiftyou're changing an entire companyculture here where tools that folks usehow do they access things where do theygo to get information so making surethat you build into that a completeskill retraining we move from where do Igo to get my data in terms of new spaceshow do I get access to that what are thetools that I'm usingas well create a culture around thatwhere as folks are still developing twoyears is a long time to migrate a lot ofworkload and so you need to build in andhave a plan and communication strategywith that of when is your applicationwhen is your workload going to move sothey could begin to design infoundations for when that shift happensand it's not a one to the otheryou need to also communicate with all ofyour stakeholders at the company and toyour customers that A Change Is Comingone of the really proud things in ourmigration that we did at with BrandtCorporation here and moving to GoogleCloud we had zero downtime impact to ourcustomers they were able to completelycontinue running their robots and sawZero interruption in any of their dataand Reportingbut we still need to conform them havethem be bought in in what they're doingthere will be leaders and laggers thatare resistant to that change but don'tgive up you're on the right pathlastly leverage your Google resources uhChris loves me when I say this one butuh you know go leverage your accountteam every time one of my tech leads orsomebody in my team was looking at a newnew technology whether that's hey wewant to look at using dataflow orspanner or we want to bring in you knowsomething we're struggling with Pub subreach out and they will tap into anunparalleled Universe of knowledge thatyou can that you can take advantage ofand really bring your team Along on whatthey're developingso now that we've landed we're in gcpwhat is that enabled and what is thatdone for brain Corporationit's really helped us change our entirecustomer experience and what we're doingwith themscaling out robotics means that you needBest in Class tools that are tightlyintegrated with our robots for beingable to do monitoring and Reportinginternally and to our customersand so as well as different platformsfor where are theyin terms of our internal FleetManagement tools we have capabilitiesfor identifying hardware issuesperforming software updates editingroutes for customers and troubletroubleshooting problematic areas inoperationbeing able to have that Fleet Managementlook and keep the robots up and runningautonomously day after day provides areally high quality service to ourcustomersreporting where customers want itwhether they want on the go walkingaround the store in their mobileapplication to see what's going onsitting at a web application being ableto pull down data be able to dig indeeper download do their own analyticsor whether they just want the pushnotification or Push Service of emailfor that quick daily scan or looking atweekly performance brain and with thepower of Google is able to offer aseamless experience in all the all thedifferent places for our customersand when we look at what we've takenwith a mobile first approach here we'vecontinued to add new features newcapabilities to make our robots moretouchless adding remote assist clearingcapabilities where when a robot getsstuck somewhere in the store theAssociate's able to use their mobilephone and let it resume if it's safe todo soadding into our next generation of robotscheduling capabilities that are mobilefirst in terms of setting up schedulesand defining when would you like thisrobot to runand an exciting new feature where we'vejust recently launched as well isreal-time robot tracking in the store Iobviously took a ride share to come overhere today and was able to see is itnavigated around the Streets of SanFrancisco much like the same way you cansee where is your robot navigating andoperating within your storemost excitedly as Chris mentioned is oursense Suite of products and what we'reable to do and building out herethis is around going into the stores anddoing data collection for different fourof the retail employees and freeing uptheir time instead of having to manuallygo around on clipboardsbrain offers two super super excitedlast year we announced our MonarchStandalone scrubber at Google next lastyear and we're excited to beginbeginning doing demos and Pilots withthat but customers want versatility somecustomers still want that cleaningcapability and being able to add onscanning to their existing roboticfleets so brain offers versatility wheredo customers want thingsin sense we offer versatility as well inthe art in the retail space RFID is arapidly emerging technology where moreand more products are getting tagged howcan brain adapt and being able to addRFID sensors to be able to collect thatdata and reduce having to manually walkup and down with wands in aisleswe still have computer vision and beingable to do product detectionlocalization and looking at adaptingother sensors in the future that we wantto add two cents as our customers addnew sensors to their environmentsleveraging all the power that we'vebuilt in all of our Fleet Managementtools sense also forced us to thinkdifferently in terms of how do we set upand add our robots into customersenvironments and make it as touchlessfor customers as possible whereleveraging our expertise in FleetManagement for setup deploymentannotation of what aisles are wherewhether something is a grocery sectionwhether it's Electronics whether it'sMeat Processingand then still getting all the samebenefits of our uh route editingperformance tracking that we have forall of our scrubber fleetslastly with our mobile firstcapabilities we have insights beingdelivered directly to mobile apps in thestores Associates get can be able toview what's out of stock what's in ontheir shelves what's incorrectly placedare price tags wrong being able toquickly scroll through look at whatneeds to be corrected in their storesinstead of having to go around and walkthem themselves we also are looking atcapabilities of integrating into withcustomers own task management apps andfeeding in that same dataand as we mentioned before 9 out of 10retailers are already on Google Cloudseamless integration and not having todeal with cross-cloud compatibility anddifferent issues here simple dataavailability in their environment thatthey can start consumingso brain obviously we try to keep Helpwin customers with their loyalty andsailorsI recently went to a uh you know HomeImprovement store looking to buy a newumbrella stand as mine had rusted outand all the rain we got here in SanDiego this yearpulled up the mobile app went lookingaround went to that bin that sectionthere's no umbrella stands there had togo find a store associate we wanderedaround finally found the umbrella standsif they had been using brain OS robotsthat would have been updated with thecorrect location of where that umbrellastand is and I could have bought itquickly and been on with my day insteadof having to walk around and hunt for itusing brain OS robots as well frees upthat Associate's time they're notmanually walking around with clipboardsdoing data entry collecting data thatcould be mismarked mistranslated lateryou know having to go through and maybetype something inlastly all those back-end analysts nowhave trusted data that they can ensureand rely on to ensure that theirinventory Supply systems are correct andaccurate they get higher accuracyresults better on shelf availability andtheir inventory systems are correct byleveraging brain OS robotsall of this is built on top of our textAI which I'm going to turn it over toChris to talk a little bit more aboutthank you[Applause]all right so I'm going to talk aboutvertex AI as John mentioned and I'mgoing to talk about cereal boxes which Ithink everyone can relate tosovertex AI is the foundation for shelfchecking AI which on the brain OS mobileapp that John was showingwhen you're looking at those items onthe Shelf how those items are identifiedand and how many of them are on theShelf that's all shelf checking in theShelf checking AI in the back end doingthatso inventory optimization is a perfectuse case for AIimagine you're in the grocery store andyou have to buy your favorite cereal andyou find an empty shelf much like theumbrella example that John gaveyou're upset because you don't get yourcereal and and the store is upsetbecause they don't get your money it'sit's pretty much that simplenow imagine you walk up to that sameshelf and they don't have your favoriteflavorokaythe models starting to confuse theblueberry crunch we can see how seriousthis situation is the blueberry crunchwith the honey oats so your cereal boxesare changing all the time it's anincredibly Dynamic Worldum I guess not as much as Oreo boxes Iguess those those change like every fiveseconds I swear there's like a new coloror a new something like that uh but yeahlet's say that you know there's a bunchof pumpkin spice cereal that's up on theaisle andnow themain robots of course this would neverhappen with brain robots but now yourrobots are collecting more images of thepumpkin spice cereal and now yourmodel's getting the data that you'refeeding your model to train it isgetting imbalancedso it needs to be retrained withbalanced data so that it doesn't startfavoring one thing over the other andthen you wind up showing up to the shelfand now there's just pumpkin spicecereal everywhere and you can't findyour your other favorite flavor which II actually like pumpkin spice stuff soI'm kind of a pumpkin spice fiendsothis is all part ofwhich is a buzzword that basically meansyou're doing all of the right things toensure that your models don't actuallyget worse over time and start puttingpumpkin spice everywhere rightvertex monitoring so this is a reallybig slide there's a lot on this slidebut specifically I'm going to zoom in onvertex monitoring on this slideit can alert you to things likeprediction drift which is the example Igave earlier where you're starting totrain your model onmore pumpkin spice than you are theother cereals and obviously the modeljust is is doing what it's trained onand it's going to start thinking thatthings that kind of look alike mightjust all be pumpkin spiceso we can balance thatour text monitoring has alerted us andsaid hey you knoweviction drift going on here now you cango and balance that data distributionwhen you're training the data or whenyou're training the model sorrybut as a startup so this session is forstartupsyou may not have time to do everythingthat was in that slide there was a lotof little steps and vertex AI can do thefull gamut it can do there are there arecompanies that are using just vertex AIto deliver successfully deliver AIproducts to their customersbutas a startup you may be resourceconstrained andthe person who's managing yourinfrastructure in your terraform mightalso be the same person who is trying torun your models and and maybe eventraining the models I don't know howstretched then they might be but uh soautoml is a perfect solution for thatyou show up with your labeled serialboxes I'm just going to keep going withcereal boxes your labeled cereal boxesyou know your honey crunch your this orthatyou label your cereal boxes youtell automl what problem you want it tosolve so a classification problem is isbasically what we're talking about herewith it's this cereal box this cerealbox this are you know differentiatingthe different cereal boxesand ultimately what we've seen is thatthings that may take data scientistsone week to implement can now take onehour because you're just showing up withyour data feeding it into the modelalong with saying this is aclassification use case there's hundredsof models that automl is going to go andtry to figure out which one performs thebest it's doing all of this on yourbehalf behind the scenes you just let itrun it's kind of like a black boxand then it will come up and say this isthis is the the right model for youanother different so I'm going to kindof vertex Ai and how it applies to brainCorp uh this now I'm going to talk moreabout things that really differentiatevertex AIso explainable AI is one of the thingsthat we've invested a lot in and insteadof cereal boxes I'll use dog breeds asan example so let's say you're you'retraining a model to identify dog breedsyou want to know which part of the dogis most important when you're doing yourprediction so if I take a picture of adog to train my model what do I want tocapture in thatin thatimage that you're feeding inusing explainable AI we can see that thedog's fur is lit up here so the fur ofthe dog contributed the most to thepredictionand going forward you would want to makesure that your training data reallycaptures the complexity of the fur ofany dog that you you train the model onso that's one way that you can you canreally see how your training dataespecially for I like this one becauseit's visualhow your training data is affecting thethe model ultimately and and what it'spredicting the second is responsible AIthat's another differentiator for usany API call you make to the Palm APIit's going to return a safety score andlabels so let's say you're running achat bot and you you know the the usersinteracting with the chat bot it'sgenerating responses and you're tryingto filter those responses that are goingback to the end user well if there'sinappropriate language in there or thethe chatbot now is spouting off aboutreligious things like you you want toknow that right like that's out of scopefor the chat botso you want to have a fallback and andhave it say maybe something genericthat's not going to get you into troubleright this is something that can be donewith safety scores and labeling there'sa host of of safety labels that arereturned withum in the Json payload of theum of the uh the predictionthe Third differentiatoris thatgen AI answers withGoogle cloud and vertex specifically aregrounded in factuality or have theability to be grounded in factualitywhen you train Enterprise search on allof your documents you shove all yourdocuments into a Google Cloud Storagebucket or your Google Drive and youpoint Enterprise search at it which is aproduct we announced a while ago butthere's been tons of content thisconference about about this productit will go and train on your data thatyou put into your Googleit or creating embeddings and ultimatelymap outhow to retrieve that data and and thengenerate a response to the end user soif you search kind of like what you dowith Google you search for a specificthing it will find where that documentchunk is that it's been trained onyou'll find where that document chunk isreturn it to you but not only that itwill say here's the file that I found atdocument Chunk in so if you want to goand fact check the model you can whichis really important becausehallucinations are kind of afoundational I guess you would say flawor it's a it's a non-trivial problem wehaven't solved for a large languagemodel hallucinations yet so it's goingto be very important that weas people using large language modelshave that grounded in factuality pieceto it so we can go and double check whatthe model's saying is correct I think inthe in the near term untilhallucinations get get solved for ifthey ever do I know I don't knowhopefully it's going to it's going to beso important to do thatthethe last thing I want to tell you aboutthe best startup I talked before abouthow you know startups are resourceconstrained you're trying to do a lotwith with not many peopleuh Google Cloud for startups program canget you started with credits a dedicatedsuccess manager and cross Googlebenefits kind of like what John alludedto before I have a really goodrelationship with John's team they cometo me when they're stuck on something orthere's a bug or terraform doesn't dosomething they wanted to they come to meI find the right person within Googletranslate the the request and and getthem to go and take the the problemseriously and kind of escalate itinternally with Google or jump in andhelp out where I canso there's three things I would loveeveryone to take away from this part ofthe presentation uh not John's part uhthree things so vertex AI has a tool forevery stage of the ml Ops life cycle yousaw that big chart up there the left toright ml Ops life cycle uh we have wehave for every stage in thatml Ops life cycle vertex has somethingall the way to the end where we talkedabout vertex AI monitoring where you candetect prediction drift and hey thismodel thinks everything's pumpkin spiceEtcsecondautoml automates model selection wetalked about how it willchoose from over 100 different trainingtypes and model types and can save weeksof effort ultimatelyand third is that Google has builtvertex AI with explainability andresponsibility in mind so that yourlives are easier but also your productsare much saferthank you all very much for coming thankyouforeign"
