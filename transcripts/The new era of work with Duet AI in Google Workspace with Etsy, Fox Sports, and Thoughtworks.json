workspace and andyour workflows and and we're going tohave with us a few of the first testersof duet AI and fromEtsy from Fox Sports and fromthoughtworks and so I'll go right aheadto the next slide pleaseI guess this is my Clickernosorry I should have asked how this worksthere we goum so we're going to give a quickintroduction of everyone we're going totalk about why we should care aboutGeneral AI how we're bringing it in inthe workspace and a discussion with thepanel and then the most exciting partwill be the questions that you may allhaveso let's go ahead with the introductionsI'll start by myself my name is selgeI've been at Google forsoon 17 years I've built a lot of thevideo conferencing products that we haveI'm based out of Stockholm Sweden wherewe have a our big Google meets teamthere and today I work with customersI'm a outbound product manager so I talka lot to our biggest customers I bringtheir feedback back into engineering andproduct and I hopefully am able tocommunicate on where we're going andwhere where all of this is going tobring us and I'd like to welcome Dustinon stage please give a nice round ofapplause and Dustinand Dustin how about you tell us alittle bit about your work and yourbackground happily I'm Dustin Myers I'mSVP of production operations for FoxSports my team is our media ecosystemand we have engaged with workspaces andduet and a bunch of Google products overthe years and we're looking to to growwhat we do all right thank you andplease give a round of applause to Mikeforeign[Applause]you flew in from Canada for this yepfrom Calgary thank you and how aboutyour background uh so I'm the chief AIofficer with uh thoughtworks a job thatI've been in for a whopping 10 weeks nowbut I've been with the company for morethan 20 years we're a global technologyconsultancy we do strategy design andEngineering which basically translatesto us building a lot of software for andwith our clients and we use Google bothto build software for our clients butalso for our internal productivity emailand the full uh the full Suite so whenyou abbreviate your title do you sayc-a-i-oI think it's ciao yeah there's likethere's so many opportunities right likeCIA or ciao or and last but not leastSean please join us on stage SeanforeignTy of of companies here we have you knowthe sports the high intensity Sports andthen we have the deep consultancy andstrategy and now we have the people thatbring I guess the human side of ofcreation to uh millions of customersSean would you like to introduceyourself sure thank you uh yeah so I'mSean Carney I am the head of I.T at Etsyand if you aren't familiar with Etsy weare the vibrant online GlobalMarketplace that connects over 90million sellers across the world withover 6 million I'm sorry 90 millionbuyers across world with over 6 millionsellers of unique and creative Goodswhat's the most fun thing you've everbought on Etsythese butterfly wings that you can wearand flap around and they're adorable andvery excited to send them to her for meit was Back to the Future slippers youknow that looked like the shoes like Ithought that was so cool and I wouldn'thave found that anywhere else we have awhole section on Taxidermy too so ifyou're ever a little bored feel freeand we are gathered here todayto talk about generative Ai and why weshould care about it so I'll give alittle bit of a an introduction and asyou can see we're going really highlevel right with starting with the theIndustrial Revolution started with steampower where we could get machines towork at factories and with the beltsconnecting everything and quite scaryand dangerous work environments and thatwas simplified tremendously withelectricity where you didn't have tohave one Central and steam enginepowering the whole Factory anymore youcould have separate Little Motorseverywhere and and then you startedconnecting these machines with computersand with the first mainframes and theseyou know created a whole new uh categoryof employment with software programmingwhere people such as myself back in theday hitting our heads on the tabletrying to get a computer to reallyunderstand what we wanted to do andsometimes it feels like you need toscare the computer into doing what youwanted to do andconnecting them giving us the internetbut I thinkwhile this is high level and you mightthink yeah yeah yeah that's this isn'tbigger than electricity what's big forme as as uh someone with a computerbackground is that it's the first timecomputers can understand youand I like to use the the the sentenceumthe animal did not cross the street itwas too tiredwhat does it meanis it the animal or the street we allknow that it means the animal but if Isay the animal didn't cross the streetit was too widethen our brains immediately know that itmeans the streetfor the first time computers know whatit meansso if you're going to remember ifsomeone's gonna say oh why why iseveryone crazy about generative Ai andabout AI in general think of the word itand it'll it this is the first time weknow what it means in computer sciencebefore we had to go look at like all thetexts in the world and try to matchsentences and do like complexprobabilities and statistics and itwould always get it wrong but now it'sgetting it right and it's getting itright uh often a majority of the time sothis is why there's so much excitementabout this and when I joined Google inin 2007we we have these big systems that talkwith each other but these the algorithmswe were developing wereyou know they're just like when youdevelop software if then else right Alot of if then else and very complex ifthen else uh arrays whereas we startedin the early 2000 early 2010s with somemachine learning where you by feedinginformation over and over again andtelling the computer this is a dog thisis a cat this is a dog this is a cat andthen the computer could start predictingwhat's a dog and a cat and we didmachine learning this wayum and and you can see the evolution ofof this right from being able to to beatuh Champions at alphago to being able tounderstand text with word to VEC and nowyou can just give a huge Corpus of textto A to an AI and tell it hey tell mewhat this is about it's a self-learningmechanismum and and this is the the evolution ofGoogle we've been Pioneers in this fromwriting the first uh research paper onword to vect I think in 2012 to theTransformer the the paper is calledattention is all you needI would have thought love was all youneed but attention is all you need andthat's the paper that transformed thethe whole industry and it might feellike super complex stuff but it isn'tit's actually readable andunderstandable and I'd invite you to totake a Pika at these uh at thesePublicationssowe're bringing this into workspace nowmany of you have usedumBard chat GPT Claude all these systemswhere you prompt it you prompt it andyou try to tell it what to do you try totell it what to do and then you tryagain and you try again and make it bluethis time make it red this time the funthing in workspace is that there'scontext right if I'm in an email there'scontext from the email so I don't so sothat context follows if I'm in adocument there's context in the documentso I like to say that workspace iscreating kind of a you know how the webbrowser was the window into the internetwell we want workspace to be the windowinto artificial intelligenceandyou're going to see a lot of theseanimations uh this is the the peoplethat have been testing duet AI in ourLabsum they they're able to have text beinggenerated in a Google doc in an emailbut for mewhen I open a new Dock and I need tostart that writer's block that Panic youget of seeing something that's justwhite with a cursor blinkingit'syou know it's always it it takes a humpto you need to go over the hump to toget going and this kind of like softensthat for me and the other use case thatI felt no one really is talking aboutuh much anyhow is the mobile use casewho here has written a long document ona phoneright there's not many you're bravepeople same thing for answering longemails right you're just gonna say ohI'll get back to that later what do weusually do we mark it as unread and thenwe go back to it when we're at ourcomputerwell what if what if instead of havingto type something you can just go andedit it and just change make some smallchanges that's a lot more compelling Ithink the mobile use case is going to bea very powerful one for people on the gothe other thing thanks to the thanks tothe fact that we know what it meanswe'll be able to start organizing yourinboxwill be able to start summarizing thingsin ways you've never been able tosummarize things before so these arethese are like this is a defining momentI think that you know we're going tolook back in 10 15 years at 2023 andsaid yeah this is where everythingstarted and it started and all these newuse cases started popping up and you'regoing to remember coming to thisconference and hearing it all about itfirstso I'll stop babbling andI'd love to hear so maybe we can startfrom from that Dustin you'll be my myfirst question todaywhat was your first aha momentwhen when did you think oh this is thisis this could change thingsthink about five or six years ago Iactually was in Mountain View with myteam and uh they showed us we we alwayscomplained that we could never findunlocked material in our systems that weknow like our our content managementsystem and I think they showed us uh wethey said well what do you want to lookfor and we said I don't know Tom Bradysmilingthank youand there you go and and it was thefirst time I think I'd seen OCR you knowand I think it was it was an aha momentand it was like you can teach machinesto know what thing what what images arelike you had said earlier you know theit well now and if you if you you cantrain a machine to understand imageryand then speech to text and it wouldthat was where my aha moments you knowyou didn't realize you were alreadyusing AI in some ways you know suggestyou know finishing your sentences orwhen you do Google searches things likethat but I think that's the one I wasthinking about walking over here todaywas looking back and seeing an OCRexample I think was the first time Irealized I saw its power[Laughter]I think like most folks in this roomI've been following the progression inthe industry for a number of years andas an artist in my personal lifeum I actually have been reallyinterested in seeing how AI intersectswith how we create right there was asession yesterday by Rafiq anadol if youhaven't seen it you should check out thevideoand he has been partnering with Googleto build amazingum mind-blowing art based on largequantities of data and so if you thinkabouthim and his team as pioneers and youthink about artists who are usually atthe Forefront of revolutions rightwhether it's cultural revolutions orother sorts of technological revolutionsI think a thing that that I just had anaha moment about here in in this spaceishow we can interact with the worldaround us and the data that we have injust transformatively different waysand I thought that was really incredibleand so I'm super excited to see how allof us really take that and move forwardover the next decade and more with itMike uh so for me it was a demo that Isaw the one of our staff had built um afew months ago of something he callsBoba AI which is an AI assistant fordoing kind of uh customer research andcreative tasks and it's a it's arelatively uh straightforward UI over alarge language model but it allows youto type in things that as a consultantyou might be interested in to doresearch on a client or to help createstrategy for them and then it would notjust give you answers and ideas butformulate them in a very specific way soit was actually able to put stuff out inuh using the playing to win strategyframework and although there were kindof holes and problems with it I was Iwas like oh wow this is actually Beyondjust the programming use case which Ithink lots of people have been talkingabout this was like many roles in ourbusiness beyond that that could beaccelerated by AI thank youumyou've beenPioneers testing this ahead of many ofusum even ahead of of us in Europe becausewe got it a little bit later than thenso you you were probably using thesetools before I wasumwhat have you seen in differentdepartments what have you seenumwhat are kind of the use cases you'veseen and the things pop upmaybe we could start with you Sean sureumso from the engineering side you know uhhelp with writing boilerplate code helpwith understanding areas of the codebase that Engineers may not be asfamiliar with super helpfulum even starting and editing internalblog postsmoving on to other areas of the businessall those pesky formulas and sheetsright getting a little insight into theright ones to useum and figuring out why maybe theoutputs of one of your formulas anddelivering what you're expecting as wellum and then I used it recently for kindof a mundane task which was doing askills Gap analysis across my team andso I was able to create a a template forthat and then build out even a trainingthe framework for a training programbased on that neat I can't wait for nexttax seasonand I know that and I know what I'vebeen using Mike how about yourself whathave you seen pop up with workspaceduetei so we had about 50 people testingit in kind of an organized way and we wetried to get feedback from them uh thethe first thing that was interesting inthe feedback was people wereactively surprised at how good it was soI I think AI is a moving Target now andand we actually saw over the course oftesting that we would get betterresponses from from the systemum and we were all kind of jokingearlier this morning as we werepreparing for this that you folks havenow announced a whole bunch of newfeatures yesterday that that actually wehaven't really gotten to grips with yetyeah but that kind of gives you an ideaof of how fast it's moving but we haveuh 11 000 people in 18 countries and soa lot of those folks are not nativeEnglish speakers and so even just thehelp me write feature uh the feedback wegot was it was incredibly useful forpeople to feel more confident in theirCommunications to be able to expressthemselves clearly and professionallyand all that kind of thingum it brings a kind of equity across theworld when everyone can expressthemselves more clearlyand not be on the back foot of it doesyou know I'm I'm reminded of a of a skipfrom a TV show where um one of thecharacters is very frustrated becauseshe's she's a Spanish native and is ishaving an argument with someone inEnglish and at one point she says do youeven know how smart I am in Spanishthat resonates stronglyhow about you yeah I mean I think lookwhat does workspace allow you to do it'scollaboration tools so for us we do wedo Global events World Cups you knowthings like that you're in differentcountries all things and small smallevents um and and there's a lot ofoperations management that goes intothat and obviously we're experienceshave been great for us but but now whatyou've introduced is is kind of like acollaboration robot if you will rightsomething to help you along and whatwe've seen is that across you knowoperations management project managementit gives you such a head start you knowif you want to let's pick on the NFLseason Once you get your schedule youcan lay out every week just by tellingduet the parameters you want it toincorporate like you said the peskyformulas you're not doing that reallyanymore it just lays it out like whatwould have potentially taken someonehours it's just it's kind of just doneand then you can collaborate on iteasily um you know we've done that kindof nuts and bolts stuff we've even takensome copy I won't say For What and askedit to you know rewrite it just to moreor less as an experiment to see what itcan do and truthfully we haven't used iton air but it is close enough to wherewith a little human editing you couldprobably use it rightimagine I can just imagine in sportsbroadcasting like how things happenquickly and imagine being able to getthe quotes and the stats in real time asthings are happening and not neverhaving to look up it just figures it outthat yeah I mean you're right livetelevision lends itself to a quickturnaround and now you have tools atyour disposal that we're look we're justnow starting to dip our toe in thatwater but you really could use this in away to shorten those gaps to get contenton the airsuper interestingumMike what what's your favorite use whatare you most excited about for the nextfew months like what do you what do yousay like this is going to be the onethat's going to change things wellum so for the for my favorite use it'sactually being able to ask it dumbquestions that I really ought to knowthe answer to uh but that I'm I'm toobusy to figure out so I'll give you anexample of that I I had aumPersonnel situation where I was tryingto find people to join my team and I hadto try to let someone down gentlythey're a great person they could havedone great on the team but one reasonthat it didn't work out and I had aconversation with them and it didn't gowell it was one of those suckyconversations where you're like Ugh atthe end of it I did I did a bad job andI actually ended up asking Bard how Icould have handled that situationdifferently and it came up with you knoweight to ten points of things to tothink about and it's not like thosepoints were particularlyearth-shattering but it it pulled themtogether in a sensible way that wasspecific to my context and kind ofhelped meum would have helped me handle thatsituation better and I've done that samething in advance of a few otherconversations that were going to betricky and and I found that useful whatI'm most excited aboutumis the stronger integration intoespecially Gmail so one of the thingsthat um I I think AI systems have have alittle bit of a tendency to do is towrite slightly Bland output right rightlike it's it's there's something aboutAI generated text that you can kind ofhalf put your finger onum it uses the word crucial a lot Inever use the word crucialum so being able to uh and this isn'tquite here yet but being able to trainan AI much more on my voice becausethere's thousands of emails that I'vewritten to make it sound a bit more likeme I'm excited about that because thatwill really save me some time and avoidme producing kind of wooden wooden AIgenerated stuff I I often work withcustomers that are migrating fromyou know what to to to Googleandone of the one of the things one of theit and it's a change management Journeyright for some people that have been onOutlook for 25 years coming to Gmailmight bemight beum daunting and when I talk to them andI say why why is it so hard to use Gmailand they say well I start my dayI spend an hour taking my emails andsorting them into the different foldersis that productivityand then but then I thinkwell you know now with these the duet Aiand it'll it's soon going to be able togive us the ability to organize yourinbox for you that's going to be again acomplete different paradigm shift forthe people that took emails dropped themto emails dropped them for me my inboxis like the Matrix are just flying bybut but there's going to be a sort ofredefinition of what does it mean to beproductive what does it mean to be ontop of things what does it mean tocreateum yeahDustin no I think that my favorite isprobably something I haven't quite doneI've been bugging you guys to do thedrive integration since we becametrusted testers and to me that's kind ofone of the big humps to get this over solike take this share drive and learnfrom it right I think it's all aboutaiming it at a corpus of data that isintimate to your organization or toyourself and then having to use thatpool of data to pull it in right so ifit's accessing all my documents thenwhen I ask it like you said help mewrite what well you know you could Ithink they showed it yesterday you couldhighlight a template you've already usedand you based that I mean for somethingI already use shifting gears to answeryour question more directly but justthey helped me write and help me revisefunction is saving me hours I'll just behonest whether it's you know all of usare in companies to one degree oranother and there's a lot of justifyingthings and writing things and it getsyou started down that path like you saidyou stare at the blinking thing like ohhow do I justify this to you knowFinance or whatnot it helps you get downthose roads and I think that's that'sprobably my favorite part that I'm usingtodayI almost wanted to do the same typos andthe same grammatical errors that I doright I want it to feel like it comesfrom me and not because oftentimes whenyou'd have these text generation you goback and you try to add your own voiceor your own touch to itumhow about you Sean yeah I don't think Ihave a better answer than these twoanswers it's that personalization andat the individual level but also at thecompany level rightbecause a lot a lot of times it's fineto get a generic either summary or or agenericum start to something butbeing able to have a response that hasyour company's values embedded into ityour company's voice your own voice Ithink that's what's gonna that's that'swhat I'm really looking forward to thankyouand so Mikeyou are a chief AI officerhow what's going to be the job of achief AI officer and how how do youbuildhow do you think of this long term whenthere's so much short-term changesomy job at least the chief AI officer fora consulting firm and you're my you'reone of the most long-tendered chiefofficer AI officer in the world after 10weeks yes yeah it's pretty goodso what I'm trying to do is acceleratethe company's adoption of generative AIinto everything that we do soum that's to into our services that weoffer to clients so for example we haveproduct development services where wecan help a client ideate and go fromzero to one on their on their productjourney and we're accelerating that withgenerative AI we help clients do what webroadly call Enterprise modernizationwhich is dealing with all the old crustysystems and thencreating new stuff not just lift andshift but creating new and awesomesystems using modern software andgenerative AI is a powerful tool to helpus analyze those things we're looking athow gen AI should be incorporated intothe craft of software creation so itworks with we pride ourselves on beingthe on the Leading Edge of bringing thethe best techniques and the best processsuccess around how to build software andgen AI is going to be a big importantpart of that not just in code generationwhich I think everybody latches ontothat because you know in in the firstplace code is magical to the tonon-coders and now you can just produceit instantly so that's like extramagical but there's tons of stuff thatyou do besides just coding documentingit documenting it deciding what to doits place you know strategizing arounditum so we're looking at it for that andthen we're also figuring out how tobring it into all of our companyfunctions because we're a regularcompany like everybody else one of thethings that we do a lot of is Staffingmatching people and their skills withprojects and opportunities and clientrequirements and being able to use genAI to go into unstructured documentslike somebody's resume and employmenthistory and their aspirations and goalsand how they want to grow and being ableto match that up with the actualopportunities we've got that'sincredibly useful so thank youhow will it change sports broadcastingI mean I think that look you'retelevision most television is is atleast pre-produced television or filmsit's not that you necessarily arefinished you just run out of time ormoney right right so I think that in abroad sense when you are when you have acollaboration you know tool here thatthat can save you money or save you timeexcuse me get you to step four step fivein your process quickly now you havemore of one of the resources that youusually run out with that dictates thequality and oftentimes your end productso I think that with that time savings Ithink it's it's it's a huge shift foreveryone right we're talking about thesesimple things writing an email well ifyou you don't have to stare at the blankpage and you've already got a templatethat you just have to edit to make itsound like your voice well that's doneyou move on to the next thing so I Ithink it will change I mean I think thatI have a lot personally in my team who'shere has heard a lot of us is the art ofwhat's possible you know I want to startpointing you know some of the uh youknow text to video or text to image toour corporis and start to create imagerybased on what our 30-year history ofimages is and start to you know Definemore and more of what we can create thatway and train it I mean I do thinkthere's a risk though like we talkedabout earlier as you create these modelslike well where do those models go ohright but I do think that in the in thenet it's going to it's going to makeeverything we do better or give us moretools what's what's daunting for me alittle bit is that I also have we allhave to retool ourselveseverythingwe know everything how we do things ischanging so quick and I have to thinklike you said what okay I'm doing itthis way and I've always done it thisway but why and what happens if I try tochange it and push myself push myselfand for Etsy which is quite a uniqueorganization where do you see this goingin and changing the companyyeah great questionumso for you look at AI more broadly Ithink that's been part of our strategyfor a number of years and somethingwe've been investing in both to helpEmpower our search results and in otherspaces starting to explore it in ourtrust and safety areas where there'sjust massive amounts of data and thefaster we can kind of get signal on thatthe better we serve folksand then to speak to the education pieceI think this is the strategy that'sreally needed right now to create therunway for the rest of the businessrightum what types of guard rails do we needto start putting in place what types ofcompliance andlegal uhFrameworks do we need to start planningfor both for today and for the futureright because where we are today isstill again it's pioneering if you takethat Simon wardley's concept right ofpioneers and settlers we are very muchPioneers in this space right now andwhen I say we I mean everyone who'sengaging in this andit takes a comfort with uncertainty sowe need to teach people to becomfortable with uncertainty we need toteach people about their cognitivebiases to make sure that what we areputting in and taking out that we'rebeing thoughtful and intentional aboutthat that we're not just propagatingmore systemic bias in these systemsum and and along the way we can helpfolks think about like promptengineering and the upskill where weneed to we can start getting a headstart on what the use cases might be onevolving our current workflows and ourcurrent opportunities so that employeeslook at this as a growth opportunity forthemselves as well as for the businessif you start that cultural Journey nowat the at the start you bring everyonealong with youI think the the companies that do thatand do that well are going to be thecompanies that really succeedforeign"
