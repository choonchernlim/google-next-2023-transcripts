only do weget to walk through what's new in bi butwe get to do that in the world we nowlive in which is being disrupted bygenerative AImy name is Kate Wright I'm a seniorproduct manager here at Googleresponsible for business intelligenceand looker and I'll shortly be joined onstage by Andrew Beckerfrom our product management team here atlooker who's going to give you someHands-On demos of what we're announcingtodaynow what we're going to do is we'regoing to walk through Google's data andAI cloud and how looker fits into thatand then I'm going to tell you moreabout some of the big improvements we'vemade to looker this year Google'scomplete the eye productand then we're going to talk a littlebit about looker's unique trusted andopen platformand then we're going to talk about allthings Ai and how we're continuing toinfuse intelligence into looker andbring AI to the Forefrontlet's go ahead and jump innow first we've all made theseincredible investments in data and AIbecause of the possibility and impactfor our businesseswe've all made a lot of investments inour people upskilling them and inproducts and services and Technologylike why we're here todayand of course in projects and programsgiven the number of people in this roomI bet you represent thousands ofdifferent projects in data and AIbut unfortunately what the data istelling us is that it's still reallyhardto realize that valuein fact68 percent of companies are unable torealize measurable value from dataand if you think about how we work withour business and show them impact ifthey can't see the ROI we're probablynot doing what we canbut thankfully there's a light at theend of the tunnel because we're at thisincredible inflection point with Gen AIlarge models stand to disrupt Industriesto help us innovate and generate newbusiness valueand here's whytraditionally it took huge amounts ofresources to extract and manage complexdata sets resources that for somecompanies were prohibitively expensivebut all of a sudden with large models wehave been able to publicly processto process the world's publiclyavailable informationand give that to our businessI'm going to say that again process allthe world's publicly available audioimages and text and give that to ourbusiness in these accessibleconversational natural interfacessuddenly our business is working withinformation in totally new ways andlarge models is what we have to thankfor thatnot only that but large models are greatat creating information they cangenerate text they can generate imagesand they can help us write codeI use large models to write my emails myhusband uses large models as he'sprogramming every dayin fact I don't think we have yet seenthe ways that our personal andprofessional lives are going to bechanged and how we're going to use largemodels every dayI've been challenging myself on how Icould potentially use gen AI in myday-to-daythis year and every year I do ascavenger hunt for my daughter at Easterand because I want to be that kind of amum I create these very Charming littlerhyming Clues you know different hidingspots throughout the house and this isthe sort of thing that is completelymaddening I hate it I'm terrible at itand this year instead of spendingmultiple hours and frustrated midnightminutesI used a large modelI went back and forth with it a fewtimesprobably took me about 20 minutes tofeed it the clues I needed to ask it tocreate the Rhymes to give it a littlebit of charmmake it talk a little bit about bunniesand suddenly I was done it totallychanged the way I did that really simpletask every year and this is what we aregoing to see in our professional and ourpersonal livesand of course that also applies to dataand Analyticslarge models stand to help our businessusers be able to access information inreally simple really accessible ways andthat's our Enterprise informationand of course gen AI stands to help usand make our data professionals so muchmore productiveGoogle's data and AI Cloud provides aunified data Foundation across yourdatabase AI analytics and businessintelligence workloadsnow unfortunatelyrunning governing and administratingdata and AI is hardbut Google makes that easier withbest-in-class capabilities throughproducts that are built to work welltogetherour approach is multi-format it'smulti-storage and it's multi-engine andit's built for Google scaleso you can apply and bring and unify allyour data and AI workloads to dateGoogle's data and AI cloudsimply and easilyand vertex AI is not just for your AIprojectsit's also for our products we're usingthose same Foundation models to infuseintelligent capabilities throughoutGoogle's data and AI cloudincluding lookernow looker is Google's businessintelligence productit

application and processpeople see consistent resultsand not only that but our in-databasearchitecture connects to any SQLdatabasemeaning you're always looking at thelatest up-to-date datano reason to worry about managingextracts and schedule data exportsnow our modern bi experience providesways to explore to visualize and reporton data both represented in governedtrusted data and the ad hoc data we knowthe business is going to uselooker provides visualizationcapabilities and self-service on top ofgoverned datalooker Studio provides an ad hocanalysis experienceand connected sheets for Looker givesyou a way to give your business aspreadsheet Paradigm to work with thedata the way they need tonow of course we've learned in the lastfew years that business intelligence isso much more than dashboardswhich is why looker is API firstour customers have built some phenomenalkinds of data experiences on the apis oflooker they've learned how to monetizetheir data how to create new productlines new applications and new premiumtiers for their own customers usinginsights and Analyticsand they've actually started infusingthe machine learning workflows that runin their organization with the sametrusted data that is part of the lookerplatformand of course we knowthat the users in your Workforce areprobably not always working in lookerwhich is why we have Integrations withproductivity Suites collaboration toolsand of course Partnerships with some ofthe biggest data and AI products in themarketnow there are three big things I want tomake sure you know huge improvementswe've made to looker this year and I'mgoing to start with looker Google CloudCorelooker Google Cloud Core makes it reallysimple for all our Google Cloudcustomers to access and to run lookerbecause we've brought it right on to theGoogle Cloud consolewe've also added increased Enterprisecapabilities like customer managedencryption Keys private IP vpcscand additional ways that you can manageyour instances you have additionalcontrols over maintenance Windows youalso have additional ways that you canaudit and analyze how people are usinglookerand lastlybecause we're always striving for deeperintegration between our products we'vealso released service agent connectivityto bigqueryand now introduced Google IAM supportlook our Google Cloud Core is generallyavailableit's accessible on the Google Cloudconsole today you can try it and ofcourse you can use itnow the next big thing I want to tellyou about is looker Studio Prolast year at this time we introducedlooker studio and liquor Studio Pro tothe looker familylooker studio is an ad hoc analysisexperience with a familiar Googleinterfaceit connects over 800 data sourcesincluding premium ads connectivity andof course Lookers trusted semantic modelwith looker Studio Pro you get all thevalue of liquor studio and in additionyou get technical support you getadditional ways to manage and governyour users and your content and ways toreach your people on the gowith schedules alerts mobile andintegration with Google workspacenowthe last thing I want to tell you aboutthat we've done in 2023 for lookerit's connected sheets for lookerI have a feeling that in this roomthere have been a lot of dashboards andreports created over the yearsand yet despite that I bet there'salways somebody in your business whowants that data dumped into aspreadsheet so they can work with itoffline yesand of course what you don't want is forthem to goplay with that spreadsheet and email itto a bunch of people because who knowswhat's going to happenwe have recognized that here at lookerconnected sheets for Looker gives peoplea way to access Lookers trusted data ina spreadsheet format so your users canwork with pivot tables formulas andcharts all on top of that trusted datafor Looker always being able to go backand connect it to the platformconnected sheets for Looker is part ofGoogle Sheetspart of every edition of Google Sheetsincluding our free editions so if youare a customer of looker your businesscan use connected sheets for liquorwhich is generally available todaynowwe chose to highlight those three bigthingsbut rest assured we've done a lot in2023we love to build things that ourcustomers are looking for and the teamhas been hard at workI can't go over each one of those rightnow so thank you for taking picturesbut I did want to make a shout outespecially to our long time lookercustomers to take a look at a few ofthose featuresfirst the advanced editor forvisualizationsyou no longer are restricted to what'sin the box and ships with looker from avisualization standpointI know that somebody in your businessreally cares about the thickness andshade of the line on the trend shirtgives you the ability to open up thatconfiguration and gives you nearinfinite possibilities when it comes tohow you're going to style and show yourdata and visualswe're also really excited about some ofthe new customization features we'veshipped for our embedded customersour customers run their own products onlooker and they want to show off theirproduct the way they want itso we've shipped additionalcustomization around theming fordashboards around scheduling and aroundalerts this yearour customers appreciate that lookergives them a complete bi productthat helps their users choose how theywant to work with data in these variousmodalitiesfor example carbon Health has foundgreat benefit to drive significantresults by using connected sheets forliquorthey were able to see significantimprovements in operating results injust 30 days of rolling out connectedsheets for liquornow let's talk about Lookers trusted andopen platformLookers trusted modeling layer providesthat single place to curate and governthe metrics that matter most to yourbusinessthis means that users see consistentresults whether they're in Connectedsheets for Looker or in an alertor an output of a downstream processcoming from Lookers APIwe want to ensure that you can use thisconsistent trustworthy information inyour tools of choice and wherever yourusers are consuming informationwhich is why we've opened up the lookermodeling layer and are working hard withour partners to ensure this works withyour own analytics and businessintelligence tool strategythat means the data that's insideLookers trusted platform does not haveto stay therewe are also working with our partners toextend the capabilities of looker makingit more valuable for our sharedcustomers and I'm going to tell you afew things about that todayfirst let's start with an updateto our visualization partnersI suspect your organizations have manybi tools in the landscape raise yourhand if you have more than five bi toolsthat you have to manage or that at leastare in the landscapethat's what I thought you know what'sfunny is is right now the record is 18for people I've met just so you know youcan probably feel like it's not too badbut that said we recognize that this isthe world we're all living in most ofour customers have multiple bi tools inthe landscape they don't talk to eachother and you end up with business logickind of scattered wherever it makes itmuch harder for users to be able totrust the data they seethis is why we've developed Partnershipswith some of the leading vendors in thespace to make sure that looker playsnicely and you can bring those trustedmetrics to where all your users workI recently announced a partnership withhotspotsoon you'll be able to use Lookerstrusted metrics in their search basedexperiencenow todaywe are very excited to announce the muchawaited Tableau integration into previewsoon you're going to be able to usetableau's familiar drag and dropinterface on top of looker's trusteddatawe are also excited to announceGeneral availability of our power biintegrationoh come onso you will be able to use Lookerstrusted data inside power binow we're also working to extend thecapabilities of looker with our partnersour partnership with sisu brings lookercustomers the added benefits of easilydetermining the root causes behindchanges in their businessso you can easily find the anomalies andthe outliers that are driving thosechanges and sisu also helps youunderstand what to analyze nextI personally love the way sisu helps youunderstand why something is changingwe are very pleased to announce todaythat our sisu and looker partnershipwill be generally available this quarter[Applause]now let's talk about one of thosenecessary evils of business intelligenceand that's data preparationwe spend a lot of our timeputting the data together connecting itjoining it aggregating it to the rightlevel cleaning it upand we want to help our customers dothis more easily so today we areannouncing a new partnership withalteryx bringing alteryx designer Cloudto our looker customers to more easilydo data preparation on their datastarting with CSV and Excel filesnowthe same opennessand flexibility is what has ledcustomers to Google Cloudsound Commerce has built a platform adata platform for retail companies usingbigquery and lookerretail companies are struggling with thetransition from brick and mortar todigital as we all knowsound commerce's data platform hashelped accelerate those companiestransition towards e-commerce using thepower of Google cloud bigquery andlookerall right are we all ready to talk aboutAIall right looker has been infused withintelligence for a long time becauselooker was born in the cloudas cloud and AI have evolved so islookerour customers already use looker toinfuse insights into their own MLworkloads and of course the intelligentcapabilities that are already withinlookerbut we're going to bring AI to theForefront of looker todaynowwhy does this matterwe expect most of our data professionalsto spend a lot of their time on tediousand repetitive tasks and unfortunatelythat keeps them really busy which meanswhen our business consumers wantinformation and answers it tends to takea long time to turn that aroundyou also have this constant back andforth Telephone Game communicating fromthe business to the analysts on what isactually neededwe believe we can simplify andaccelerate how people use informationwith Gen AI which is here to help usI want to tell you a little bit aboutwhat is coming very soon to looker andour looker customerstoday we are introducing duet AI forLooker it's like having an analyst rightin your pocket[Applause]now duet for AI for Looker helpseverybodyso it helps our consumers be able toeasily get information because they canconverse with looker to get answers thatare relevant for themand once they have the information theyneed they can easily share it with theirbusinessduet AI for Looker helps them get theirjob done the analysts so so much fasterwe're helping analysts generate visualsreports and formulasall using generative AIand for our developers and our dataengineersduet Ai and looker is going to help themgenerate the code required to configurecustom visuals and to write lookamlmaking it so much easier to define thesemantics that run your businessnow I'm very excited to welcome onto thestage Andrew Beckerfrom our product management team who'sgoing to be showing you these variouscapabilities of duet AI inlookerlive now Andrew Escapeget that quickerawesome should we see some demosall rightso yeah our teams have been workingsuper hard and we're really excited toshow you all these cool new capabilitiesso our first duet AI capability enablesyou to have a conversation with yourdataso you can ask questions in naturallanguage and get back charts and tablesso it's really like having an analyst inyour pocket at all timesthis is really about democratizingaccess to data-driven insights it'spretty good at handling even vaguerequests and it can come back with someoptions to clarify if necessaryso when you find what you're looking foryou can add those charts to your reportwith one clickI'm going to go ahead and show you thisworking in real codeso this is uh really a whole new way ofinteracting with business intelligenceso we recognize that answering questionsand building reports really twodifferent use casesbusiness decision makers in particularsometimes they just want to get to theanswers fast and the interface can be anobstacleso conversational queries makesanswering those data questions fast andeasy this means more people makingdata-driven decisions with less timespent on selecting fields and formattingchartsso here we've added a little breakdownof our top five categories let's goahead and try one more how about aweekly sales trend for last quarterso duet AI is going to come back and askto clarify if you meant orders createdshipped or deliveredand we'll get that answer and we'll getthat added to our reportall right automatic slide generationso a long time ago a PM mentor of minetold me you know you can have datawarehouses data lake houses all kinds ofdata things but all data eventuallyflows to slide decksso how many hours has this group spentbuilding slide decks you know formonthly reporting annual reportingquarterly reporting so the second of ourconsumer Focus capabilities automaticslide generation does that for you wewant our users to spend their timefinding insights not building out slideslet's take a lookso your AI analysts will build Out fullpresentation in Google Slides it's goingto take each chart from this reportand it's going to make a slide for eachand each slide will have naturallanguage bullet points summarizing thechartso these will call out Trends maximumsminimums differences all kinds ofdifferent insights definitely a hugeTime Saver for anyone who does regularreportingall rightduet ai's report generation capabilitybuilds upon the conversational querieswe saw earlierso here you can have your AI analystcreate an entire report for youwe all know that building and stylingreport can take much longer than findingthe datareport generation gives dataprofessionals a great start get a reportsomething that you can build onso we'll start by entering a fewsentences about what you want in thisreporthere we're asking for performance yearto dateyou'll tell it any fields that youdefinitely want to include andgenerative AI will suggest the chartsthat should be in this report and buildthe full layoutyou can choose some formatting andstyling options as wellthis is a huge Time Saver for anyonewho's spending time building reportsmanuallyall right on to formula assistantso looker studio power users will befamiliar with calculated fieldsthese can be pretty tricky to buildespecially heavy duty formulas like casestatements I know I always have to checkthe referenceI've been using this formula assistantthe capabilities in Duet AI for a fewweeks now whenever I need to find acalculated field formula and it's prettyawesomelet's try a couple formulas so we'reworking on a brand performance reportlet's try something easy let's do profitmarginformula system takes care of that noproblemlet's go ahead and get that added to theChart hereand let's try something a little moredifficult let's do bucketingprofitability high and lowanything over five percentformula assistant knows how to writethat case statement makes it super easylook at that it added into the tableall rightAdvanced visualization assistantso visualization tools always have alimited set of chart options and as Katementioned it kind of always seems likethe one that you need is not the onethat you haveand power users can code custom viz butwhat about the rest of usso in looker we recently introduced thisAdvanced viz config it's a Labs featuremake make our visualizations much moreflexible but it does require writingcode so now we're adding a naturallanguage assistantthis means infinite possibilities forcharts without codethere we go all right so we'll have duetAI update this chart and I've got somerequirements we'd like to make one ofthese a dashed linego ahead and apply that and how aboutmaking one of these series into a columnchartsuper easy uh let's try highlighting Minand Maxall right one last thing let's move thatLegend to the upper rightall with natural languagemakes it super easy we're really excitedabout this oneall right lastlylet's talk about the lookamal assistantcapabilities of duet Ai and lookerso we know it can be a hurdle to learnlookamal and with generative AI we canmake that both easier and fasterso your AI analysts is going to help youchurn Out lookamal Rapid clip really getto the value of looker modeling muchmore quicklylet's take a lookso SQL Drive tables for example aresuper helpful but can be challengingespecially for newer lookamal developerswith lookaml assistant there's no needto remember the correct syntax how tojoin tablesso this is really great for those timeswhen getting through a tricky part needa little bit of help getting startedit's going to generate that look a milefor usso we cannot wait to get thesecapabilities out to our users thank youso much and back over to you Katetime hereall right are we all excited about duetAi and looker[Applause]we are really confident that duet Ai andlooker is going to help everyone in yourorganization work with data I meanpersonally couldn't we all spend alittle less time formatting the data anda little more time actually using it tomake decisionsconfident High judgment decisionspowered by dataduet AI inlooker will be coming topreview soon we encourage you to sign upfor our trusted tester program throughduet AIand you'll get first hands-on experiencewith duet Ai and lookernowwe wanted to give you a preview of allthe things we're doing around infusingintelligence inside looker and this iswhat's coming soon to our customersbe honest that this is just thebeginning of what it means to bring AIto the Forefront of businessintelligenceI wanted to give you a sense of howwe're thinking about the problemfirstmaybe highlighting the problemthe reality is that it's still theminority of our Workforce that actuallyhas access to use data every dayand I'll tell you as somebody who's beenin this industry for a really long timethis number really hasn't changedand this is why we're so excited aboutthe possibility of generative AI forchanging this game for us because of theway that it's simplifying the way peopleare using informationwe believe that this kind ofconsumerization of interfaces could bewhat drives us to see more of ourWorkforce meaningfully be able to usedata in their day-to-day jobsso let me tell you a little bit aboutwhere we're going with looker because ofcourse Google has always been on theForefront of AI and looker is nodifferentwe imagine a world where it's reallyeasy for everyone to just chat withtheir business datawe want our users to feel like theytruly have that analyst in their pocketthat's always on never sleeping andknows what they neednow the possibility of having morepeople be able to get answers quicklywithout always relying on a dataprofessional could be revolutionaryand not only that but once people havethe information they need we want tohelp them share it with otherstell their stories with data in theformat for the Right audience at theright time at the right momentwe can create powerful beautifulimpactful data storiesall with business intelligence with theaid of generative AInow I bet there's a few people in theaudience right now who are gettingbutterflies in their stomach at the ideaof giving the keys to the kingdom totheir businessbecause there are a lot of challengeswith trust and data has to be accuratewe can't have our business makingdecisions on data that can't be trustedand this is why the trusted data foundin looker forms such an importantfoundation for us not only nowbut also going forwardwe believe that we can solve thesechallenges by not only having aconsistent set of information that issemantically Rich inside the platform oflooker but also working to connect thedata professionals with the businessusers in easy ways to ensure that youreally can give this kind of freedom andpower to the businessnow I promise I won't make you literallysit here and imagine it I'm going toshow you what this can look likebefore I roll the videoI want you to just
