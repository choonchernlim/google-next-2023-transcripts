going to shootsomebody uh here in the audience toguesswhich one of these has more emissions uha cup of coffee and you're gonna win a50 Starbucks gift card a cup of coffeethe actual coffee you're drinking or theCup itself like the paper the paper cupsoum let me choose somebody you know thatyour front center on the cell phonecalling them out in the glassesoh got you calling out on the cell phoneoh what would you guessum which one's more carbon emissionsall right it's going with the paper cupall right well Steve is rightnow it's actually the coffee itselfum so a lot of what goes into that isyou think about the farming thetransportation the waste you know Etcactually generates more than some of thepaper cups which a lot can be recycledso some other things to point out howcan you you do this so you can useFrench Press at home we all haveautomated coffee machines Etc you can doFrench passes manuallyum you could reusable cups when you takethem to Starbucks it's you know they doa lot of those programs now so some waysto invest there so anywayum we're still going to give you thegift card as a consolation I'll give itto me any but uh with that said I'mgoing to turn over to Justin to jump inthere a little bit on the Esco right sohere's what we're not going to do todaywe're not going to try to influence youthat climate change is real that youshould care more or less about it thisis not like an Al Gore uh presentationwhat we're going to talk about today iswhy this is relevant to every companyregardless of what you think aboutclimate change Tony tapping into all thedifferent stakeholders that impact thecompanies we work with from investors tolenders to The Regulators that can trulyinfluence our Top Line right we thinkabout you know customers Etc to ourbottom line and our costs to the amountof risk profile we have relative to allthe regulation that's happening in thespace so this is not an emotionalpresentation this is to try to givecontext as to why this stuff matters toevery business and then as a little bitof teaser why you and not to paint abroad brush but generally as Bradmentioned right this is a technologyconference this is a data scienceconference this is about big Solutionsand those good veins that is what's beenmissing in this space and as we've gonefrom historical ESG being kind of a youknow a front office strategy brand putsome Investments the amount of data andquality and information that we needthat makes decisions in the future andto be compliant with regulations hasdramatically gone up so I I willhypothesize that this group will play abig role in your peers within yourcompanies will be playing a huge role inthis space in the near future if you'renot already so we're super excited totalk about thatall right first of all ESG there gets abad rap a good wrap depending on youknow if you're in a red State a blueblue State this was initially aninvesting strategy right let's lookbeyond the financials in terms of how wemake decisions about companies in theacronym stuck it was used to capture andstill is a Litany of issuessome of these issues are related andcorrelated and some of them are notthe challenge is when you conflate allof these issues under the acronym ESGwhat is most important for most of yourcompanies is to identify which issuesare most material right so if I thinkabout environment climate is a big oneand more specifically carbon emissionsthat's the 80 pound gorilla this iswhere a lot of the regulatory reportingis on when you think about climatechange it's usually CO2 or carbonequivalence in the atmosphere that's alot of the scrutiny that's what we'renow having to report Etc so there'sother things in here environment fromwater consumption Etc but we're going toZone in a little bit about carbonbecause of its disproportionate impactfor most companies when you get intosocial there's a lot of issues dependingon your type of companies certain issuesmaybe more important than other we're aServices Company people are our asset atPWC diversity and inclusions one of ourmost important issues you know if you'reyou know developing shoes offshore youknow working conditions might be themost important social issue for youright so these issues are not all equaldepending on the company and then yougive it get into governance how do wemanage our company what transparency dowe have into our tax policies and thosetypes of things so a lot of issues notsaying that they're all equallyimportant and they're certainly notequally important within every companythe key is what does your company caremost aboutclimate and carbon is certainly a bigone I would say 90 of companies have todo something material and so we'll spenda lot of time today using that as anexampleI've alluded to this earlier and this isthe take all the emotion out of it I'moperating a company these are thestakeholders that are becoming more andmore important in this spaceso investors and this is interesting alot of investors and we work with PEcompanies they do diligence now aroundESG right they want to understand therisks of the company and exposures inthis spacewhat's also interesting is if you lookat all the cost cutting that's beenhappening you know the last couple yearseven in Silicon Valley and in the techsector but certainly across the countryinvestors are also saying yes we likeyou know ESG we like a lot of thoseissues on the prior page but what isthis costing us is this not a blankcheck to go fix you know reduce ouremissions to zero if it costs usviability within our company again we'llkeep coming back to the theme of datait's becoming more and more data to getour life for these companies you knowthere's activists employees employees ata lot of companies we do a lot ofsurveys like these are important issuescompanies are voting or your employeesare voting with their feet the types ofcompanies they work for you know we'vecertainly been reports about Exodus fromsome companies because certain issues oryou know attraction from some othersRegulators I'm going to hit so I'll talka little bit more in the next slidelenders there are loan covenants tied toyou know certain ESG goals there isaccess to different or preferredinterest rates tied to different ESGgoals and achievement of those goalsthere's you know Green bonds and thingswhere companies are announcing billionsof dollars of financing that they'regetting solely because their Investmentsare meeting certain criteria so all ofthese things become most you know reallymore important including consumers andagain the question is can consumersactually move and will they choosedifferent companies based on certain youknow certain conditions around aroundESG and a lot of Industries the answeris yesso I'm going to kind of quickly pick hitsome of these thingsbut this is important for us to knowright within it functions with datascience functions data operationsfunctions on the Y I think sometimes ourfunctions and our companies come to usand say I need this I need this data Ineed it yesterday Without Reallyarticulating the business caseagain even if we are you know agnosticto our own feelings about whether theclimate's changing or how or how fastthis stuff is hitting companies and youhave to be compliant with regulationright I guarantee every one of yourcompanies files financial statementsassuming they're a public company ifthey're a private company you'reprobably filing to get access to certainyou know loans and things from Banks Etcbut we've now got you know we've hadEuropean jurisdictionscoming out with required disclosures inthe space in much more detailspecifically around those carbonemissions where the SEC announcedproposals around carbon emissions thatare now kind of going through you knowfeedback and then comment and expect tobe finalizedwhy does that matterif I were a company like a lot of yourcompanies probably once a year put out asustainability report probably sometimein the summer they got six months to doit not under audit now my officer isunder the same penalties that they canget for having materially misstatedfinancial statementscan go to jail if we're materialistatingour impacts on emissions and thingswhy is this getting CC detention it'sbecause of that also think about all thecompanies that made you know a lot ofyour companies have made bold goalsaround going Net Zero reducing climateemissions Etcnow I've got to provide a lot moretransparency under the subject ofregulatory scrutiny as to how I'mactually achieving those goals well whatif I you know provided these goalswithout a lot of data on how I was goingto get there that's the case mostcompanies are in so there's this littlebit of is the tide going away and youknow people aren't wearing the swimsuitsas you know for an analogy I mean thiswill provide more Spotlight andtransparency and all the goals we'vemade and how we're achieving thosethe other side of the cointhere's been a lot of incentives thathave come out recently right the IRS hassome incredible incentive multi you knowbillion dollarsum you know this the in the inflationreduction act which actually wasn't agreat name for given all the climateincentives what does this mean thismeans that your companies that have madea bunch of Investments or plans to takeon a bunch of projectsto achieve carbon emissions remissionemissions goals or you know calleddecarbonizationprobably didn't factor in all theseincentives and taxes now you have allthese different incentives and taxesthat can materially change the decisionsthat we make about when we do certainprojects How We Do Itum and what type and what geography wedo them in so if you think aboutthe needs to be compliant here and notbe embarrassed because our data doesn'tultimately support what we've beensaying for the last few years or youthink about trying to make sure from acash flow perspective we're takingadvantage of material credits we've gotto have really good data for thisum I won't go into this but just notethat if your stakeholders are asking fora lot of datathere's multiple standards that havebeen in the space describing what typeof information we need to report thetype of you know metadata that we needto capture these things are starting toalign and there's at least enoughcommonality that companies can getmoving so we're not paralyzed because ofthe flux here just know this is adynamic space and the best answer iswhat is the least common denominatoramongst all The Regulators amongst allthe standards that are going to be ableto allow my companies to provide thedata they need in the future and a lotof companies are not in that positionright nowokay Brad I'm gonna get it back to youbecause I think it went a little bitlongbut this is the evolution your companiesare going to go through really fast orneed to go through in order to managerisk and to be able to take advantage ofall the opportunities in the marketaround ESG and climate Etcmany companies are on level one leveltwothey are compliant with the limitedregulations putting out a sustainabilityreport things are localized it's allspreadsheets how we you know use certainestimates for certain emissions where wedon't have the data generally notconsistent across the world Etcwhere we need to get really fast so 10Kthat's my annual financial statement fora public company we got to get hereand if I have inconsistent policies if Isay hey if I have an HR statement thatsays hey we are the greenestcompany in the world and then myfinancials now back that up that's goingto be trouble if I've made a commitmentto A lender that I'm meeting certaincovenants and then I go here under thepenalty of audit and it shows that I'mnot that's going to be trouble so I gotto get quick quickly compliant I got tohave good policies I have to havecentralized data which Brad's going totake us intoto be able to manage all the needs and Ineed to be able to do it quick if youthink about financial reporting we'vehad decades to build up Erp systems youknow cloud data platforms Etc and we'veiterated we iterated now we've got a newset of rules around an all-new type ofdata right carbon emissions which ourcompanies are not used to generatingquickly so it's probably a small teamthat does the same ability report thisis going to become another 80 poundgorilla like we think for mostorganizations you guys are going to needto be key parts of theorganization and the and the functionsthat you represent and Brad's going toget into a little bit morecoolthanks Justin um all right quick breakagain next next guessing game here uh weall traveled probably to get here or atleast you took a car or an Uber even ifyou're local so question on which ismore emissions driving a car all the wayfrom New York to this location or takinga short flight from LA in economy so allright whatall right we got driving down hereandcorrects driving is is flying is is youknow is uh you know pretty carbonemitting so again some other things youcan do electric vehicles one interestingpart of that is charge your electricvehicle with fuel like solar panel thatis clean so depending you know there'snuances in that and then some of you maysay that the airlines actually havecredits or you can uh contribute fivedollars to help making them you knowreduceoh uhoh sorry yeah I'm sorry I I uh the greenbox is on the wrong one sorry Iapologize for that so but you got thecorrect answers though all right fiftydollars for this guy too yesum so I think theum as Justin talked about the maturitycurve it's kind of why can't companiesdo that now like what are the challengesaround getting thereum why isn't everybody a leader and soJustin we want to highlight a few ofthese things before we go into some ofthe solutions as to you know thebarriers for for companies becoming morecarbon we talked about all thestakeholders to manage and they needdata at different levels for differentpurposesviability we have a lot of companiesthat are cost cutting Etc yet I need tomake all I've made these commitments Ineed to get there how do I do that howdo I do that with Roi considering allthe things we talked about big dataanalytics exerciseuh organization and change management toactually come up with the plan and thenexecute that through all levels ofsupply chain Opera you know operationsprocurement c-suite back office there'sa lot of um you know coordination thatneeds to happen and then the data againthis is the rest of this presentation tobe on the data the data is not easy tocollect it's not just sitting in systemsI got to work with my energy providers Ineed to make estimates where it doesn'texist and in this data it's hard tomonitor right even if my Energy companysays this stuff so the volume of datathat I need to manage and monitor andput controls over is really significantand there's now a ton of vendors in thisspace I mean by the month you'll see newvendors that have some role in theecosystem around you know Computingcarbon Etc what we'll hint at lateragain going back to the role that thereason we're up here at the Googleconference isdespite all the different vendors andall the sources there is a big need forsomething in the middle right to manageall this and that's we're seeing a lotof companies turn turn hereso as we look at this kind of a recap ofthe stakeholders I think one importantaspect of this is looking stakeholderand business value first I think ifanybody's been involved in the pastcouple decades of building dataplatforms there's been a lot of build itand they will come and so it's importantthat you avoid that here as well anddon't just dump a bunch of data intoquote of ESG data Lake and then expectyour organization is going to justsomehow benefit from it so it'simportant to work from this vantagepoint across your cut what yourcustomers need what do Regulators needwhat are lenders requiring and focus onthat and incrementally build your dataAI reporting intelligence capabilitiesaround that maturity because if you tryto mature it all at once in this bigBuilder they will come inevitably yourprogram will stall lose funding loseinterest and and not be very effectiveumand maybe just one comment on that thereason we always try to highlight allthese stakers some of the mistakescompanies have made is saying we're justgoing to build out the data model forkind of one set of most imminent needsand that data model is you guys knowright if that data model is not at theright level detail for some otherneither later it's a lot harder to goback into our Erp systems our subledgersystems unwind that and add more detailright so it really is trying to help allof the different you know stakeholdersthe organization responsible is thinkabout all the future needs of theorganization and the level of detail toreport in order to come up with a datamodel today even if you don't build outthe entire ecosystem you know over thenext couple years yeah exactlyum so here's just a little bit of aanother view of the maturity that Ithink most companies are here on theleft you're just trying to track thingsreport on them what what is happeninglike I just need to get a number outum I obviously want to move more towardsmanaging that so how am I looking atthat actually creating an optimal planusing data using different scenarios andthen getting all the way into how am Idriving you know a more Top Line viewwhich I think is a little bit fartheraway meaning I think people look at howwould I make more money by being alittle decarbonized Etc but again it'sgoing to start bleeding into your brandinto preferences and is as we evolve itwill start to be a choice betweendifferent companies based on howcompliance or non-compliant you are sobut that means you have to have veryAdvanced AI data so you can actuallypermutate on what if analysis from abusiness perspective from an acquisitionperspective a divestiture as you'relooking at those decisions that requiresa lot of analysis a lot of data to getthere and so I think the first solutionof which I'm sure you guys uh will heara lot about you know here at theconference is really the data platformbecomes the heart and soul of a lot ofthis and so really focusing some energyon getting this right uh it is importantand that's you know all the way from thethings you're doing to ingest datamaking sure you have more modernizedscalable flexible ways to ingest datainto a data Lake that you're takingadvantage of things like data models sothere's going going to be and this isthings we focus on is how do we createan industry standard model so everycompany isn't inventing that for thefirst time because Regulators are goingto ask everybody for the same type ofreport it's like accounting so youshouldn't be Reinventing this thereshould be things you're taking advantageof there's rules engines that that againshould be standardized to help createthose calculations but it should also beflexible there's reporting capabilitiesyou need there's going to be Ai andgenerative AI capabilities things likedata services not only are you going tobe subscribed driving to data from thirdparties that are giving you thecalculations giving you data sets thatyou need to compare against industrybenchmarks but you're going to beproviding data your company's gonna youmaybe you're a supplier and you have toprovide your data set to somebody who'sbuying your product therefore you need adata service that's easy for them toaccess and it's not the manual send themthe file every month you know unscalabletype of need so getting this kind ofcore platform correct you know is keyand everything will build off of that soum starting here is importantyeah as you look at this across kind ofthe architecture diagram and I won'tdrain all this I mean this is how itstarts to look in the typical data Lakeyou know reporting diagrams we all seeand are very familiar with is you haveyour data sources on the left here andyou know that's one thing to note youknow obviously the all the great dataproducts Google has the data flows anddataplexesEtc in the middle and many moreum as you notice in the top they'regoing to be kind of different Marts orlakes that you create so one may be morefocused on decarbonization another morefocused on human capital as Justintalked about what how diversity andinclusion efforts or workingenvironments and so there'll be some subsegments of data Lakes of rulesanalytics regulations that are beingapplied to each of these things but it'simportant that you do look at the commonmetadata some common you know companyassets that are used so you haveconsistency across those things and thenas you get into report uh generationit's not going to be just as easy as ohgenerate a report off the applicationthere's going to be back to Justin saidaudit requirements controls like is thatreport really accurate and how do I knowit was accurate versus it was just kindof something my organization felt thatI'm on top of so there's going to be ahigher level scrutiny just like with anykind of accounting systemum there so this is a bit of a view onon the data platform and then Jesse youwant to talk about yeah a real lifeenvironment of a client of ours thatkind of Incorporated this uh this kindof architecture many companies I wouldexpect suspect in this room someonewithin your sustainability team or yourESG team has said we got to go you knowproduce some reports right that you knowaround let's say climate or carbon andthey probably looked at a number ofvendors we have like 10 differentversions of the slide depending on whattools they're using for the calculatorright workday Salesforce sphera rightthere's a number of different workivathere's a number of different tools thatyou can put in the right box and this inthis client they were using workday todo part of the calculation at the endbut in almost all cases where companieskind of starting at that end andthinking what is that reporting engineor that core calculation engine theprocess Upstream to get the quality ofdata to put in and organize and all bealigned on what that data means and thatwe could support it under audit thatwe're putting in here is still a big gapso in this case the client hadimplemented you know the back and thenimplemented workday and we came in witha with with you know their Google Cloudyou know customer we came in and built adata Hub with Google on the front endwhich is actually where 90 of the timewas spent right it was organizing allthis information trying to collect itvalidate it cleanse it Etc because Iguarantee I get back to my point earliercarbon data does not come necessarily atthe right level of detail that you needat the time you need Etc so there is alot of cleansing and organizing andaggregating that needs to happenum you know in this spot so what wouldbe interesting for you I think in yourorganization is understand you know howare we how are we developing the datafor our sustainability reports today youknow are we looking at other vendorswhat are we planning to do to becompliant with those regulations Imentioned right if you mention anyprobably say csrd in Europe and you knowthe SEC proposals which were which we'reaware of and starting to get ahead ofthis discussion the benefit of this typeof model again regardless of the vendorsis it's flexible and basically agnosticto the other tools in in the ecosystemso whether you're uh you know any of theErp systems right your sap Oracle or youknow any other tool in the Erp side youknow this can kind of be the thesolution in the middle that thatconsumes that data that spits it throughwhatever the number of vendors are thatyou know your companies are selecting indifferent different parts so one versionwe showed here but we could have showedyou 10 other ones with different vendorswith with gcp still being that kind ofdata Hub in the middle as an anchorum so I think the next aspect the aspectof this is reporting so Justin mentionedlooker obviously you know Google'sreporting capability and Toolyou know these are the types ofanalytics and reports that you're goingto need to generate around scope one twoand three emissions so what are mymissions across internal and my supplierecosystem things like my brand HealthSupplier Diversity Pathways like how amI getting there how am I getting to thisplan and what's the justifiable reason Ithink that's achievable uh investmentopportunities you know mitigationstrategies so there's gonna be variousaspects of of analytics that are goingto be required and you know this is justan example of you know again there'stons of versions of these available butif you have for exampleum you know a spend and riskcategorization of reporting categoriesmaybe you have 15 categories you'regoing to report you can start to look atcharts this is an example of breakdownsof where you're where you're spendingthe most you can look at you know perthousand dollar spent or per milliondollars of Revenue what are my emissionsas an organization am I seeing that gothe right way one of my biggest areas tospend even you know uh Benchmarkcomparison so in these categories forexample I maybe have six areas that areabove the Benchmark so I need to maybeaddress those and at least at minimumget my organization down to a benchmarklevel as you as you progress through amaturity curve so this was pretty coolum there's this concept of scope threeemissions which and a sustainabilitySummit later this year there will belike multiple hours of presentation soand that's the ESG professionals so wewill not drain that but the punch lineis there is pressure not only to reporton the four walls of our company rightI'm going to stick with the climate andcarbon example and like what we producein our factories Etc but what about ourentire supply chainokay all right if I'm consuming piecesfrom suppliers that are really bad froma admissions perspective or a Workforceconditions perspective Etc thatgenerates supply chain risk and a lot ofcompanies are moving towards settinggoals around scope three and supplychain so again back to the reason likethe gcp you know componentry was soimportant was a lot of the dataCollective was also from our suppliersand all these different and all thesedifferent formats and companies Etc andonce we had it in there and organized itwas really easy as you guys know ifyou've used Luca Etc to build thesedifferent dashboards and cuts and saywho are our highest risk suppliers if wewant to sit stick with this goal toreduce our emissions by 2030 2025 Etcdo we go squeeze these suppliers becausethey're they're creating a lot of youknow missions in our supply chain and alot of large companies some of thempublicly stated this are working withtheir suppliers to do that and a lot ofcompanies are working within theirprocurement functions to to considerthis stuff so again just another reallygood example of you know using Googlestack to be able to drive insights intosupply chain risk Etc to supportprocurement function as well as abroader organization yeah no totally andI think to Pivot on that of you know thethe Hot Topic of you know everybody'smind right now is a generative Ai andwhen you look at generative AI appliedto this space and the things you canstart to assess and analyze and how doesit help you wrap your mind around thechallenges you're facing here you knowand planning you know when you'rethinking about the options how do I getto Net Zero by 2040 2050 and look at thepathways look at it just said what'sgenerating my biggest problems orchallenges what are the options that Ican take advantage of from differentenergy sources Etc there's a hugeplanning aspect there there's regulatorydisclosure management so you know now Ineed to look at all of these newregulations coming out and get my mindwrapped around what does that mean formy organization I have a policy doesthat policy now need to change is thatgood for me bad for me so there's waysin which you can use generative AI tomore quickly assess summarizerationalize those things and then from adata management is another space it'sjust it said you have all of thisinconsistent data coming in and how doyou use generative AI to rationalize ityou know correlate it together determinewhere you have gaps so many differentways in which this can be used and justthink you know things we've already beenyou know playing around with andtrialling to see how well does this workis is a little bit of a solution aroundasking questions uh you know to a quoteAI environment specialist bot so tospeak and you know as you would you knowask these questions you know what's thisor you know what are the order ofprojects for a particular site let's sayit's a manufacturing facility or adistribution facility what order would Iexecute projects in order to reach acertain goal um so you can start askingit questions and it would come throughand say you know here's some example theother projects and the order in whichyou would execute those orumwhich projects need the most capex I'mstrapped with with you know with thecash and what's going to strain me themost so you can start to look at thoseuh you could look at which ones reducecarbon the most and I could look at thatbut then if you're saying well I wantmore of a cost benefit which one is theleast amount of spend for the little youknow the highest amount of input or outyou know a result you know what's theratio between that so now I have thishighest ratio project which is the bestcost benefit option for me topotentially tackle this organization sothese are just the the ways in whichagain users can start to you knowinteract with this data plan inspect itand and think about this in a moreiterative fashionso another space to look at isprediction and optimization so I thinkeverybody's seeing the prediction boomand when you're looking at things likeweather energy usage product demandservice demand that goes into a lot ofhow you planum your supply chain your production youknow Etc and so I think one of theimportant points here is what I thinkpeople have ignored a bit is on theoptimization so it's not about great Iknow it's sunny or rainy today it's likewhat what are you doing about shippingyour product differently am I goingaround the storm am I sending it onground versus Air and you're looking atenergy usage how am I looking at powerdistribution over time I can predict theneeds based on Storm's weather but howam I optimizing that so I'm reducing mycarbon footprint as I go forward and sovertex AI is obviously Google's amazingAI platform they actually have their or2operational research tools and for andthese are really meant for theoptimizationum space they're very specific for forthat and the combination of those twothings is a really powerful thing toapply to your organization because thisgets you the predictive that gets youthe prescriptive like what do youactually need to do on a day-to-daybasis quarterly monthly basis to improvethose thingsand and I think well no final categorieswe'll touch on is around digital twinsso many organizations may be embarkingon this spaceum and digital twins can represent aversion of your product a version of afactory a supply chain a vehicle energygrid Etc and the intention in terms ofyou know how it relates to adecarbonization situation maybe ifyou're creating a product and you're anr d and you have to produce a physicalversion of that to test does it work isit usable does it functionum you know that's that's uh iterationsthat you go through if you could do thatdigitally and find some mistakes oroptimizations first before you startproducing those physical versions that'ssaving you know that's decarbonizationum same thing with uh another companywe're talking to is like hydrogen ifyou're looking at hydrogen energy andyou look at an infrastructure of what acompany Energy company is dealing within New York City for example likethere's a there's a whole plan that'svery delicate to balance the the gridthe existing infrastructure where canthey run things where would gas linesbreak because they're 50 years old andso having a digital version so that theycan iterate on that to get to what anoptimal you know best cost benefitlowest risk scenario would be versusactually having to go out in the fieldand try to try to do that in today'sworld so that many ways in which thesekind of digital representations ofbusinesses are going to help companiesiterate and decarbonize on a much fasterscaleso with that we're kind of coming closeto the end the last uh last guessing uhgame here maybe we'll go over on thissideum is some some swag here around whichis more decarbonized the the sweatshirthoodie you know type of gear or aBluetooth speaker and like which onewould have more carbon emissionsall right I'm gonna go here in the frontyou're thinking that the sweatshirt ismoreso just barely a little bit more on theon the the sweatshirt swag soum and again there's things in terms ofrecycled Electronics sustainabilityfriendly retailers that use you knoworganic cotton other things you can doum there to to just be aware ofuh with that just so maybe we want totalk about the last steps here on movingforward yeah I mean look take anythingawaythe regulations are hereand we need better data to do reportingif this has not showed up on yourdoorstep yet it will and it may comewith a really short timeline that seemsalmost unmanageable and probably unfairrelative to typical you know developmenttimelines for this and that's notnegotiable right if we're generallypublic companies so that's that's theregulatory component but the otherreason we wanted to show you those otherSolutions is there's a ton of corporatevalue Beyond just being compliant withregulation which is really importantright there's a lot of risk there's aton of corporate value to adding betterand data and Analyticsto what your organizations are doingaround sustainabilityand in most organizations the twin youknow the twins shall not meet yet or youknow whatever the expression is butbasically companies aren't you know datais Sciences teams are not integratedwith the sustainability teams are notintegrated with the reporting teams alot of what we're doing is just tryingto get everybody in the room together soin without you guys in the room rightagain to paint a broad rush aroundtechnology and data scientists and theteams that kind of lead these platformslike the business users don't even knowwhat's possible they don't think aboutdigital twins they don't think aboutum you know they may be excited aboutJenny they don't think about how I canactually optimize the decision makingthey don't even think about you knowleveraging you know maybe the cloudplatform to organize all thisinformation and drive Global efficiencyso we really think you guys have theopportunity to be the superheroes inyour in your organization you know inthe very short term if you haven't beenintegrated yetbut couples quick things get the dataplatform stood up again there's gonna bea lot of selections around vendorsthere's gonna be you know differingneeds let's get a data model dataplatform set upum let's get with our other businessstakeholders tell them we're here tohelp and support hey we heard about thisconference we've been studying you knowwhere can our group add value to yourgroup I think that's been really goodmeetings when you know technology hasmet with the business on this topicand then you know there does need to bea framework forum you know thinking through all of ourinvestments whether it's the technologyInvestments the actual projects aretaking all of this is a big dataanalytics exercise that you guys cansupportappreciate everybody's time enjoy theconference[Music]"
