thank youoeveryone so Amit I did share your roleat Google Cloud but what I didn't tellthe audience is more about yourcredentials yes you are actually a nextfounder and a enalinvestor I'm sure that our startups inthe audience would love to hear morefrom you about your experience in thetrenches with them sure thanks forhaving me and hello everyone thank youall for coming it's a lunch time andbeing here it's nice tosee I hope you guys having a good eventso far uh no I think uh I've beeninvolved with a lot of startups uh for Iwould say 15 20 years and have variousmostly seed investment directly frommyself uh but also in a different way interms of Acquisitions as well uh so atmy previous role when I was at Oracle weacquired close to 4050 companies andthere were various sizes it started withcompanies which were very foundationalbasic technology providers who we coulduse as a ability to build productsaround uh second kind of companies welooked at were companies who could kindof create a new categories for us rightso finding areas where we can findTechnologies we can build a lot ofbusiness around that with other thingswe might have at at Oracle as welland then public companies as well rightso companies which have kind of scalegiving you a ability to kind of go intoa lot of new businesses and bringing alot of install base of customers and wecan create a a larger business aroundthat as well right so that's kind of thetypical uh acquisition part of it butfrom the start of investment perspectiveit's always been about finding the keykind of Technologies but also the rightFounders and the team so with with seedinvestment typically but what I've seenis that it's very hard to predict whatthe product will eventually evolve to soas many of you if you are founders youknow that you start with a concept andit evolves and hopefully you can pivotenough and fast enough to keep up withthe requirements and whatever feedbackyou're getting from customers as well sotypically I look for uh companies whohave great founding teams a lot of themmight have come from the network I havehad for many years you're working in theindustry and being in the Bay Area youfind and meet so many good people whohave great ideas and they're looking forgood start to get going right so that'stypically what I've seen and then onceyou have a good team and good foundationjust kind of figuring out the market fitgiving it some particular amount of timeand then be realistic about theprospects and many of them have not donewell but few of them have done quitewell and over time they able to kind ofget the the product right they get theright kind of customer adoption and finda great outcome for that right so itvaries a lot I mean it's a pretty bigspectrum of capabilities out there thatway this is so interesting Amit we wereat the games the Giant games yesterday Iit is a big fan baseball by the way andGiants W so I saw that yes that waswonderful so there are so manyapplications of the technology forstartups so many Industries areas canyou talk more about over your experiencewhat type of um Industries or specificapplications that really interested youyeah I think I come from a very uhtraditional enterprise software worldright so those are never sexy excitinginteresting to many people when you kindof go and Pitch it but when you startunderstanding the problem you're solvingand making sure you find a nichedepending on what you're trying to doright you might be finding a niche interms of like your feature over time butreally changing how that thing will bebuilt or creating a new area categorybut you don't know how that will evolvebut at least finding those segmentsinside the Enterprise space Enterprisespace is huge I mean billions andbillion dollars of Tam and each one hasso many different Subs segments at leastfind figuring out which areas so likesecurity for example has always beenchanging and evolving right I alwayslove kind of hearing from Founders whohave kind of solving a next generationalissues around security and you mightfind things that are maybe single signon 20 15 years ago but now how we doingFederated Ser Federated logins and howdo you kind of connect different systemstogether you seeing things with web 3 interms of how do you do identity so againsolving similar problems with newtechnology is very very critical becausethat security segment deols very fastsimilarly if you look at data that'sgoing a mind field of opportunitiesright so there's a things you can doreally badly but if you find the rightarea where it's going to could be a gemthere you can definitely be a goodprovider around a lot of the keyfoundational pieces right so data isanother area which I find fascinating anopportunity I think even if you look atnow with Gen you're solving similarproblems but in a new new technologycontext so that would be another uhimportant space and then I think it'sability to kind of pre create a verygoodfoundational uh technology set which youcan build applications on if you canprovide light tools you can provideright kind of developer experience andthat could be another segment which alot of customers eventually will pay forso I think the key thing when we lookwhen I at least look at the companies orthings we also buy like is itmonetizable right a lot of good Conceptsbut if not going to nobody going to payfor it doesn't really help so havingFounders and teams who are thinkingabout how that will not just be adoptedbut also you going to be able to makemoney and have a long long longer termrun with it uh just not building technusing technology for technology sake isimportant I think yes so I mean we'vetalked so far about you know some adviceas a Founder as a as a VC but as I'vebeen unpeeling the onions yes of yourcareer I also know that you haveAcquired and integrated over 50companies at Oracle in Google so whatare the factors that contribute tosuccessful startup exit with acquisitionyeah no I think it's uh you we probablywhen I was when we look at companies youlook at many many events only feweventually make it to the acquisitionphase yes and typically uh what you lookfor is one a good cultural fit and justbuying a company and then having thatbecoming part of your organization couldcreate a lot of problems if you don'thave the right culture fit so we try tofind like-minded uh folks who arerunning that company and who will comeon board and help us integrate and kindof evolve it right uh technology fit isof course important right making surethat it does provide very goodInnovative capabilities and it can bedifferentiated and can really help theproduct you're going to integrate itwith or create a new area build it outvery fast right uh that that is alwaysbeen an important part of it and then ingeneral I think uh the price of coursealways important uh we always want tomake sure you're getting the best bestuh outcome from the investmentperspective from you're acquiringcompanybut then it's going to be monetizableand you're going to be able to providethe right kind of uh returns and then asI said we look at when we were doingAcquisitions and we do that at Google aswell it's like either are you are youbuying something to augment some areaswhere we have a tuck-in kind ofrequirements and there a lot of thecompanies which really make a bigdifference because if you have to buildeverything organically it takes yearsyou might not hit the right Mark and itmight be too too late uh from in termsof getting mind share out out thereright so finding companies who canreally be good tuck in makes it mucheasier and if you have a good culturalfit you can go things go very fast uhand then if you look at companies whoare going to be uh really creating a newsegment at Oracle for example uh we haddone this whole security segment wherewe bought like we call it String ofPearls small small companies but veryvery differentiated very good technologybut when you connect them all togetherthat created more than a billion dollarof business individually they might nothave succeeded and build that biggerbusiness but you connect and you findthose four or five companies who goingto become a big foundation when you haveno presence in that area and then doingthat we're doing something similar nowwhen we start doing things around likehow do you augment existing areas in atGoogle like we B bought looker forexample yes right which was uh on top ofbig query and suddenly with big bigquery looker and some of the dataintegration Technologies we've acquiredas well uh we are now able to providefull end to end solution to ourcustomers so customers do appreciatethat because if you're not justproviding end to end but well integratedexperience it's a it's it's an importantthing so you have to be realistic whenyou buy companies and when integrate Ithink the founders or the team whichyou're bringing in has to understandthat they have to fit in and you uh wefind a lot of times with companies thatoh we want to run the way we used to runand as long as that remains it becomesvery hard to integrate yes you have toreally change that mindset and the teamshave to be willing and able able to kindof Drive the next level of growththrough through the Partnership if I canprob a bit more in what you just saidI'll call it connective tissues yes soso in your experience have you ofteneffectively looked at the differentcompanies you're working with and you'reworking with and find you know synergiesand effectively introduce them to eachother to build together yeah yeah Ithink a lot of these things when we finduh Acquisitions or opportunity toacquire a company they started withPartnerships it's not like this comesout of the blue find a company we didn'tknow about either you're partnering withthem you're working with them in someform or shape uh you might be alsocreating an ecosystem where you findlike how those combinations will make adifference to a customer so again it'sall from the customer angle what are thepieces you require to finish a fullproper offering which solves the broaderproblem right so no I think theconnecting uh Partners together and someparts you provide as uh Google and someparts you provide through a partnershipin ecosystem and we doing that a lotmore nowadays if you think about a lotof things you announcements you sawtoday I don't know how many were you thekeynote but other things you'll see overthe next few days are broadly onecosystem play right because you can'tacquire everything uh and a lot ofstartups love this idea that they canremain independent but they can get theleverage of company like Google to scalebecause the biggest problem for manycompanies we we speak to is a scal partof it right they can get good technologythere a lot of good engineers and goodproducts you can build uh you can getthe first five wins of customers youwill be you will be very high touchyou'll get them successful now scalingfrom that 5 to 150 customers to 00customers always tricky and that's whereI think the Partnerships with companieswho have a larger ecosystem and canprovide that uh go to marketcapabilities and solutioning does matterright so everything doesn't have to bean acquisition doesn't have to be anexit through things I mean of courseeverybody wants returns if you going toinvest in a company but I think there'san opportunity nowadays which used tonot exist probably 10 15 years away youcan still be independent and and doesn'thave to be huge company but still beable to be a decent player in theecosystem right so you don't have toevery time exit through an position oran IPO you can still be independent andthere a lot of small wonderful startupswhove been able to do that for manyyears yes and this is one of the reasonswhy we are so excited to have you heretoday and to network at the lounge wehope that you'll find you know likeminded um startups and potentialPartnerships will um emerge from theseconnections so I it let's shift gears alittle bit okay so generative AIgenerative AI generative AI so we heardfrom uh Sund and TK this morning duringthe keynote we have a startup audiencein front of us I'd love to have yourpoint of view on how generative AI canbe used by startups not just AI startupsbut all startups you know regardless oftheir field that can harness the powerof gen yeah no I think gen is of coursetop of mind for every one I think forthe last many months uh everybody's beentalking about it and for for a real goodreason I heard from Sund and Thomasabout the Innovation happening and howit makes a difference so I think it'svery similar to what was happened withCloud I if you look at 15 years ago orwhatever 10 15 years ago people startedbuilding applications you to build onPrem application move to cloud-basedapplication that are the big uhtransition and every new applicationstarted been built for the cloud rightand there multiple kind of things rightpeople provided Cloud Technologies asthe cloud foundations like what Googleis Prov providing or AWS and Azure andothers but there were a lot moreapplication creators who were buildingapplications for the cloud right so whenthe Cel moved for example Cel on premiseCRM and Salesforce kind of build thesame thing exactly but in the cloud andthey kind of pretty much took over thatbusiness and build out a whole CRMbusiness similar things are happeningnow with J I think J is going to be afoundational technology everybody'sgoing to use I don't think so there'sgoing to be next Generation applicationbuilt without gen as a foundationaltechnology there'll be again multiplekinds of providers they're going to befoundational provider infrastructureproviders like you have Nvidia providingthe chips for example or Googleproviding tpus we provide infrastructureto run those chips as well uh and thenthere are foundational provider llmcompanies out there who are doingtraining the models and providing thatas the building blocks including Googleanthropic coher name them I mean therequite a few but there's going to be fewI mean they're going to be not thousandsof them it'll be like 10 to 15 becausevery expensive to do but then you cantake that leverage that that technologyand use it in your application and youit's not one Foundation model is goingto fit everybody's requirement so youhave a lot of choices and you can useopen source Technologies or you can usethings which Google provides or other uhfoundational companies uh modelproviders provide right and build yourapplication so I would expect everyapplication which is coming out now willuse this capabilities the questionbecomes is how easy it can become foryou how much time you need to spend onit just like initially the cloudadoption was a little trickier I thinkthe technolog got better and better andnow you can build an application withoutthinking too much on the cloud I thinksimilar things will happen with Gen aswell we have starting to do a lot ofthat stuff you saw some of the demosaround Vex AI right with set of apis orthrough the modern model Garden orthrough the console you can autocreate alot of the applications on top of itwithout having to write a lot of codeand you can get benefit of it into yourapplication itself through the apis so Iwould expect I think uh more and morethose will happen over the next year ortwo and it will become a capabilityeverybody needs to know about everybodyneeds to learn about uh but I think thethe value will be that how do you use itto differentiate your product right uhand when we talk to a lot of ourcustomers now who are buildingapplications they are thinking of a lotof innovative ways how this thingchanges their application processes howthey change their interface how theychange how what kind of information theyprovide to the customers and how thatcould be a big difference maker versustheir competition right so I think theInnovation will come from people whohave domain expertise if doing medicalstuff you're doing things aroundsecurity or you're doing things aroundworkflow or other things how can you usethis thing to make a difference in thereand there's a lot of capabilities outthere and you can kind of go wild andyou can learn everything but might notbe the best thing can you find the areawhich matters and then getting get getinto the depth of that and then use uhproviders like Google or others who hasthe foundation pieces which you canreuse and kind of get learnings from andthen you can focus on your value ad andyourdifferentiation thank you Amit so you'veheard it here generative I is here tostay there are multiple applicationsit's not this year's Trend and we'llmove on to another Trend it's definitelyhere to no I think if you look at theinvestment happening in the space it'scrazy right and many of you probablyseeing that and uh of course there are alot of fake AI companies as well so youhave to be little careful uh justbecause AI doesn't mean it is reallygoing to change anything but uh as longas you find the right mix in there rightthere's a business value customers findusefulness and then you are doing someInnovation around those Technologies aswell right I think there's a wholecustomer service area which is changingdrastically you're seeing medicalapplications changing uh quite a lot uheducation same thing so I think everyindustry is having a big moment now andeverybody every customers I speak toevery Enterprise customers any anyindustry financial services othersthey're all starting to use this as away to accelerate their customerrelationship but also differentiatetheir offerings and everybody has somuch data about this Enterprise they'refinding now a lot more value of it aslong as they can figure out where thedata is sometimes which is always a painfor them but if you can provide servicesto make it easier to use thatinformation and build uh value ad thatthat makes a hugedifference well thank you Amit you havebeen wonderful thank you forprioritizing startups thank you thankyou all good luck everyone thank you[Music]he"
