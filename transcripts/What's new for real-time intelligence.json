    "transcript": "[Music]thank youwelcome everyone to Google Cloud nextit's wonderful to be back in person witheveryone for the first time since 2019.you're here today because you'reinterested in hearing about real-timeintelligence and how we can change yourbusinessyou may be wondering how can myorganization take advantage of the powerof real-time intelligence and make itwork with my existing Investmentsyou may be concerned or skeptical thatadding real-time intelligence to yourworkflows may be a little too costly ora little too cumbersome or maybe alittle bit too confusingmy name is Sacha nagarwal I'm a productlead here at Google cloud in our dataanalytics organization and I'm superexcited to be with you todayI'll be covering how Google thinks aboutreal-time intelligencetalk a little bit about how some of ourcustomers have seen benefits I'll spenda little bit of time on some of therecent innovations that we have and thenI'll be very excited to have Chris andkidar from Ulta beauty join me on stageto talk about their successes withreal-time intelligence then we'll closewith some next steps and call to actionand then have q a with you being able toask us your questionssound goodlet's get into itso let's get started by talking aboutthe state of real-time intelligencetodayorganizations everywhere in all sorts ofEnterprises every Geo every industry aremaking investments in real time decisionmaking and the Way That We Gatherprocess visualize and activate real-timedata is new and transforming ourbusiness processes almost all theorganizations eighty percent in thisreport and even more in our experienceare really looking at operationalizingreal-time intelligence with machinelearning in AIthe real key to capitalize is understandthat real-time intelligence is aboutthose minute Split Second opportunitiesto make Better Business decisionsleading to Better Business outcomesand real-time data is being generatedmore than ever before everything'sconnected we've been talking about theinternet of things for many timestalking about server-to-serverinteraction having data flows and datameshes and all of this moving togetherand then adding on top of that thisgenerative AI moment where we need togather the data process it and takeadvantage of these ml models andartificial intelligence and really makesense of this information so that werealize these Better Business outcomestalking about increasing our Revenuetalking about reducing our costs talkingabout furthering the bottom line talkingabout better unique transformativedifferentiated customer experiences toincrease your lifetime value and you'reseeing this again in all sorts ofIndustries you're seeing it in socialmedia you're seeing it with differentdevices we're seeing with multi-channelCommerce when we're bridging online andoffline worlds and again these AIapplications generative AI with modelsthat need to be updated in real time andapplied to our real-time data feedsso let's get down to businesslet's get down to real return oninvestment eighty percent oforganizations are seeing increased topline revenue through a leveragingreal-time data some examplespersonalized offers and omni-channelvisibility62 percent of organizations are seeingefficiency in productivity games leadingto lower costs and better bottom lineperformance and you can see that withpredictive maintenance when we'retalking about heavy machinery or oursupply chain it speaking of supply chainhow do we make sure that our assortmentis adapting in real time so we don'thave wastage and breakage and spoilagein our warehouses and look at that lastnumber almost 100 percent oforganizations are seeing increasedcustomer satisfaction leading to higherlifetime value and actually reducedcustomer acquisition costs examples ofbetter fraud detection so you have abetter checkout experience Networkreliability making sure you havecapacity and availability whenorganizations and customers need to takeadvantage of your networkpersonalized care Internet connecteddevices personalized Health Care betteroutcomesreal-time intelligence really doestransform the way in which we look atinteract and activate our businessprocesses our teams our employees tohave better business outcomes for ourcustomersyou take advantage of real timeobviously with Google Cloud we have anapproach that we think makes sense andis differentiated by being trulyUniversal we are thinking about allengagement from customers to machines toteam members to Partners we're talkingabout all different kinds of analyticsmachine learning Transformations batchreal-time dashboarding all kinds of datanot specialized streaming data only buta truly unified system that takes yourbatch data your streaming data yourstructured data your semi-structureddata video audio photos bringing it alltogether in our unified data ecosystemso you can take advantage of theinformation you have and layer on topthese benefits of real time andstreaming and again the speed it's not astandalone streaming real-time systemit's deeply integrated with yourexisting Investments through ourPartnerships through our commitment toopen source and through our big platformof Partners over 1 000 Partners on theGoogle Cloud platform and growing everyday and of course this is globallyavailable Google cloud is one of themajor hyperscaler clouds with morelocations than ever before and withunparalleled uptime over five nines ofuptime worldwide you heard us talk intoday's keynote about security that wehave unique and differentiated in GoogleCloud so that these benefits areavailable to you your customers yourpartners your employees when you need itwhen you need to rely on itand so here is how we do it this is ourfully integrated golden path Cloudnative to Google Cloud we have pubs upfor messaging dataflow for truly unifiedbatch and streaming data processing withpower of ml built in bigquery our Cloudnative data warehouse you knowpioneering the separation of storage andcompute built in with vertex AI we'vehad this ml framework and thesepossibilities and this moment is hereand we have met at the moment withvertex Ai and looker obviously NextGeneration business intelligencereal-time dashboarding seeingvisualization so organizationsindividuals can make sense of this dataand just below you can see the differentways in which this works from activationthe choice that I talked about opensource Partners continuous modeltraining making sure that we're takingadvantage of real-time data as wegenerate it so that our models aren't aday a month a year behind where we aretoday and of course activating thoseinsights it's more than just dashboardsit's more than just real-time visibilityor predictions it's real time activationhow do we make changes in applicationstate for Better Business outcomes it'sthe power of real time and the deeplyintegrated Google data and AIinfrastructure that we've thoughtfullymade sure works well together so thatyou can recognize these benefits in asshort a time frame as possible so againwhat does this Roi look like withnumberswell Forester conducted a total economicanalysis for us and used just one partof that solution with dataflow this isbased on a composite organization thatagain Forester has independently puttogether and you can see thisincrease in developer productivity over50 percent infrastructure cutinfrastructure costs excuse me cut inhalfpayback time measured in months notyears speaking to How Deeply thisintegrates with existing Investments youdon't have to create a parallel newcomplex infrastructure and then have amigration and of course that return oninvestment that number 171 percentityou know it makes total sense right lessthan a year almost double your return itmakes a ton of sense and then when youlayer on top some of our other productslike vertex AI which shows a 387 percentROI or looker which shows a 480 Roithink of the compounding effects oftaking advantage of the Google Cloudnative golden path for real-timeintelligence and of course you can talkto your account teams and we're happy toprovide these reports to you but it'sreally interesting when you startlayering on top these benefits andseeing these compounding effectshere's a real world example ourcustomerbooking.com is one of theworld's largestSpenders on digital ads they have thisginormous PPC pay-per-click adinfrastructure that responds in realtime to changes in weather changes inevents changes in customer demand andother signals that they see and whatthey've done is they change theircreative they change their biddingstrategy in a matter of Moments byincorporating real-time datathey've mentioned that their spent is inthe billions with a B dollars per yearwhen they talk about their overallmarketing spend and their PPC is a verysubstantial proportion of this so youcan imagine what the ROI is here it'smeasuredum it's measured in millions of dollarsand you can see what that means with avery short implementation cycle30 times reduction in implementationtime cutting down that system cuttingdown that learning cutting down thatflywheel between Gathering dataprocessing data and activating that datafrom hours down to minutes and workingon making that even faster down to fewerminutes and even secondsso I'm really excited to talk about someof our latest Innovations in ourproducts and we have a couple of deepdive sessions later in Cloud nexttomorrow and Thursday and I'll coverthat a little bit laterso as I mentioned Pub sub is our trulyCloud native Global partitionlessdifferentiated messaging infrastructureand we've been really really excited tomake it even easier for organizations toget data with Pub sub from where it isto where it needs to be last year weintroduced bigquery subscriptions whichallows you to stream data directly intobigquery and use it for elt workloadsnow we're bringing that same Simplicityfor your data Lakes use cases withdirect to Google Cloud Storagesubscriptions it makes it so easy itgives you simplified data pipelineslower latency and lower costs andincreased flexibility because there arebatching options if you need itflexibility and how you want to deployit and because we have the separationbetween Publishers and subscribers inPub sub you can attach these newsubscriptions to your existing topicsyet again one of the ways that weintentionally invest in making sure thatyou're in your existing Investments canbe leveraged in new and fundamental waysanother exciting Innovation that we haveis dataflow ml this was announced atCloud next last year and we've been veryexcited to see organizations takingadvantage of the power of data flow thetruly unified batch and streaming dataprocessing and bringing that to bear formachine learning use casesrun inference allows you to do machinelearning inference with just a few linesof code and allows you to do so with avariety of ml Frameworks including Pitorch scikit-learn Nvidia Rapids and ofcourse Google's own tensorflowautomatic model updates again when Italked about making sure that your mlmodels aren't stuck in time that youdidn't just train them once and thenleave them out there to atrophy as youget new data the power of data flowallows you to continually update thosemodels so that your real-timeinferencing is as good as possiblebecause the world isn't static we arelearning constantly and things arechanging data flow plus vertex workingtogether provides a truly end-to-endreal-time streaming machine learninginfrastructure for both training andactivation and this is unique to us atGoogle and speaking of tight integrationwith vertex we have really spent a lotof time making the developer experienceas good as possible we know that it ishard it is difficult to find thesemachine learning Engineers so it'sincumbent on us to make them asproductive as possible and so with fullml op support tight integration withvertex AI pipelines we're allowing thesemachine learning Engineers to spend moretime on code and less time oninfrastructure and all the other cludgewhat we call toil to make those thingshappenso this is critically criticallyimportant and a differentiator for whatmakes data flow and the Google data andAI Cloud unique for real-timeintelligencethe last one that I want to talk aboutis more investments in developerexperience Beyond just machine learningso we've really tried to make it as easyas possible for organizations tounderstand and realize the benefits ofstreaming through eliminating the needto manage infrastructure one of thethings that we've worked on is Rightfittingum Dynamic thread scaling and asymmetricscalingto essentially make it as easy aspossible for the data flow system tohandle all the infrastructure addingworkers removing workers when you don'tneed it so that it scales up and down soyou have no wasted spend while you'restill getting those business outcomesthe real-time outcomes that you need tohaveone of the common sources of performanceproblems in a streaming pipeline can bestragglers or late arriving data theseitems take much longer to process thanother types of data this is one of thethings that we've really really focusedon because we may not control the sourcesystems that are feeding into us and sowe don't want to cut them off we don'twant to eliminate them from ourprocesses we want to handle them in anefficient way we spent a lot of timemaking that as good as possible byreally automatically determining thecause of that straggler and making iteasy for you to heal your PipelinesDynamic destinations I talked beforeabout how we are intentional aboutmaking our products work well togetherDynamic destinations for Pub submessages allow you to move Pub submessages to the right Downstream systembased on certain attributes that youdefine this saves you money and it savesyou timeand the way that it saves you money isby not having duplicate data that youthen have to filter at the destinationsystem we do that further Upstream soonly the right information gets to theright place and because you do thatUpstream it saves Time same as the toilof having to re-implement thatdeduplication infrastructure over andover and over again imagine that you'reusing Pub sub's new payload on rubbingtechnology for reverse ETL use caseswe have a hundred a hundreda hundred record across just yourmarketing stack alonethis capability makes it super easy foryou to make sure that the rightinformation is getting to the rightoperational systems to drive yourbusinessesand lastly I mentioned regular detectionbut another thing that we have is datasampling I how do we make sure that youas a developer can go and inspect what'shappening in your pipelines well we canautomatically sample the actual datathat's happening so you have a referenceas to what's happening it's one of thosetrust but verify we're making sure thatyou have the tools at hand to fullyunderstand your systems so that you canmake Better Business Directionand I'd love to talk about anothercustomer that's been super successfultell us an organization in Canada thatdoes Telecom they've seen their dataprocessing times reduced dramatically a20x reduction by taking on data flow andusing it for its truly unified batch andstreaming capabilitiesand what's the Better Business outcomethat they've been able to seea 50 percent increase success rate inautomatic customer resolutionfaster time to resolutionhappier customers reduce costs increasedRevenue through the power of real-timeintelligenceI'd love to invite Kata and Chris up tothe stage now to talk about theirsuccesses with Google's real-timeintelligence Solution please give them ahand[Applause]welcome gentlemen andhello hi everyoneyou can see who is who now yep so whydon't we start with you why don't youtell us just a little bit about Ulta andwhat makes Ulta unique and differentsure yeah I'll be happy to how manypeople here are shopping have shopped atUlta or have someone in their householda lot of hands good stuff very good allright I think most of you know who weare we are by far the largest specialtyBeauty retailer here in the UnitedStates and you know you can see it onthe page here right we believe Beautydoes make the world a better placeum you know we believe build thesebeauties for Everyone We Believe beautyis it brings out the best in everyoneand that's the entire business that wehave built around this entity of beautythat brings Joy to the World so nextpage pleaseum so a few facts and figures about whowe are as a company so we are a publiclytraded company one of the like I saidthe largest beauty retail in the US uhwe are about 10 billion dollars inRevenue we have a significant uhpresence in terms of stores as well asour Ecom business uh we are amongst thetop top highest fastest growingretailers out here in the United Statesand one of the one of the most proudestthings that we have for us is ourloyalty program we have over 41 millionactive members as of last week we hadour earnings call all and we have over41 million active loyalty members on ourloyalty card right and that generates atremendous amount of data by which wecan do really wonderful things in termsof our our customer interactions andthen one final quick page please andwhat makes us special is really our whatI call our secret sauce on a page youcan see the key aspects of our strategythat have really been contributing toOur Success so it all starts with ourour store base where we have a verystrategic realized real estate assetbase that we leverage for promoting anduh you know encouraging our customers toengage with beauty we have a very wideassortment we have essentially allthings beauty all Under One Roof we haveof course our very strong digitalexperience model uh it dries very wellwith that's what I think brings us a lotof power being able to you know combineour brick and mortar experience with ourdigital experiences and then of courseyou know our loyalty program which Italked about one of our crown jewels andfinally our services business not manypeople know that we also have a fullservice Salon in almost every singlestore and that creates a significantstickiness factor with our customers andprovides their all their beauty needsUnder One Roof so that's kind of whatUlta beauty is we are like I said one ofthe biggest retailers in in Beauty andwe do some amazing things in terms ofdata that's actually I'm gonna pass itover to my colleague Krish who's goingto talk about what we are doing withdata cool all right thanks Kelly this isa really great intro so you'll see thename Darwin you can read it as Evolutionright there's a it's an acronym for alonger thing but as Keda mentioned wehave 41 million loyalty active customersright they make millions and millions oftransaction we have six plusDistribution Center so that means we areactually sitting on the gold mine ofinformationbut it it just doesn't give you a valueuntil you have a solid foundation thatensures that you have really goodquality datathat is reliable available at the realtime or near real time right and it'savailable for the business usage in aself-service mode because if they areconstantly relying on some technologypartnerfor making the data available it slowsdown the process you know you mentionedabout Split Second decisioning right youcan't have too many handles right andthat's what we are doing but we have areally big Vision there we as you'resetting the foundation with right set ofplatform and Engineering that's scalablemakes data available real time we havethe right set of governance on top of itbut our vision is broader we're reallydemocratizing is across the organizationso that you know most of the time yousee the marketing starts with byleveraging the information and all butwe are pushing it across all lines ofbusiness or call it store operationsupply chain merchandising right Financeso that we as an organization can reallyreally extract the value of our data andthat's what we are doing as part ofDarwin yep that's awesome and it'sreally really interesting to hear aboutyou talking about democratizing andgettingthings out of the loop so people canself-service that's great you know youmentioned things around merchandisingaround supply chain other areas do youhave a specific example where thisDarwin data platform has allowed thoseend users to solve service and realizeBetter Business outcomesperhaps absolutely actually there arequite a lot yeah let's start with lossprevention so for those of you in theretail industry as you can imagine thethis this organized crime right toretail crime and the losses becomes abig factor and it impacts the bottomline so prior to this just a quickexample of it the prior to sitting upDarwin rightwe had loss prevention team creatingExcel spreadsheet from pullinginformation with different places andthen emailing it out to the store or theDistribution Centerand then getting feedback again and thenagain collecting the information backcorrecting it and feeding it back againinstead what we have done we haveactually the real-time data coming intothe secret system and it's available inform of a dashboard So based on youraccess level you can just go click clickclick you get the information it's thistremendous amount of efficiency again wejust realized and within a very shortperiod of time so that's that's a greatexample then there are lots of otherexamples of finance and supply chainthey're all looking at it yes I'll addone more example to that we have youknow we have a large merchandisingfunction right of course we sell productour product is ultimately we buy theproduct from our various brand Partnersour Merchant team actually is usingprice elasticity models developed by myteam to make better decisions on pricingso they have price elasticity modelsthey can use to make inform and havemore productive data based discussionswith our brand Partners when we aretalking about seeing changes in in anupcoming quarter or For an upcomingseason another quick real-time exam thatis not particularly real time but otherreal-time example is personalizationright so we are constantly collectingdata signals as customers are looking atour digital properties and using thosedata signals to in fact inform real timeproduct recommendations or messaging orreinforced messaging based on where theymight be in their life cycle and anyparticular promotion that we may haveactive at any given point of time nothat's awesome and one of the thingsthat's really great is you mentioned thepricing example which is not necessarilyA real-time one but you have a singlesystem that you're using for your realtime and your batch use cases and beingable to bring data to those sometimesdifficult conversations maybe with yourbrand Partners you know makes all thedifference in the world and so you haveto have trust in that that's exactly youknow we talked a little bit about thefunctions inside your organization andhow they've benefited I'd love to hearan example or two of how this benefitsthe end consumer those 41 million peoplein Ulta rewards the folks who come inhow are they benefiting those teenagersthat love you you know tell me how thedata platform with Darwinyou know really makes that better yeah Ithink the biggest example I wouldprovide there is again in the realm ofpersonalization right so with 41 millionactive members on our customer file thewe know you know our customers and mostof them are she right she's telling uswhat she's buying when she's buying howoften when not all kinds of signals sheis giving us willingly it it is so muchpowerful for them when we are usingthose signals to make much more informedand better messaging to them back backin return right so it goes in the formof personalization of emails it make itgoes in the form of personalization oflanding pages on our website uh it's inthe team in terms of personalizing theapp experience providing very specificoffers that may be relevant to aparticular person knowing what theirpreferences are makes a hell of a lot ofa difference right in their lives whenthey are ready to engage in the categorywhich it's almost every day I canpossibly add something if you look atourhistorically how a customer behave rightif you go back maybe 10 15 years backthe customer is happy to get aoffer on your mailbox right and react toit maybe after two or three weekspossibly take it out and then look at itmake a trip to mall and then use itright I think those those days are gonerightusually I don't know how many of youopen your mailbox and look at the offerusually you toss it in the trash bagtrash can right so our new generationexpectus to know them better right expect usto know what their choices are so thathyper personalization really reallyknowing just beyond the information thatthey usually provide but reallystitching together their behavior gonnaenable us or enable anyone to Targetthem properly and that's what you'redoing that's how we are gaining thetraction in that constituents becausetheir pattern is completely changing andwe have to evolve uh based on thepattern right you know you can Implementthese things and then they change theresponse to it and then you can't havebeen left behind that's rightcontinually update the way that youengage the way that your models assumewhat these interaction patterns are andthe data can be inside the 41 or outsidewith other signals that you have as wellright exactly so it's really wonderfulthank you so much let me talk a littlebit about how everyone here in theaudience can realize the benefits thatyou have and then we'll open it up foryour q a sound goodso a couple of things we have lots andlots of ways to help you and yourorganization realize these benefits andI just want to highlight some of themyou can talk to your account team tosign up for a hackvest workshop whereyou can work with Google or a partner inyour environment to do a proof ofconcept and see what's happening we havelots of self-service and guidedtrainings we have dataflow Academy youknow for one specific product to make itsuper easy and we go in depth in personwith you on the power of data flow butthen we also have things like Courseraand beam College where you canself-service and share videos with yourteam so you can learn some of thesetools across not only dataflow but therest of the Google data and AI stack andyou can accelerate your time to value bywell great artists deal we havereference patterns and referencearchitectures that you can look at for awide variety of use cases to see how touse the Google data in AI productstogether to realize better businessvalueagain there are some additional sessionsthat I mentioned earlier machinelearning to streaming data that'stomorrow at one o'clock and thenbigquery at the center of our data lakehouse we have talking about continuousreal-time analytics and SQL bringing thepower of streaming in real timedemocratizing it into all of ourproducts learning from each other is howwe do it internally to bring bettervalue meeting you where you are you canlearn more about that in the replay onThursdayand with every session here we do wantyour feedback so please do complete thesession survey in the mobile app youknow five stars all the rest of it I amyour Uber driver for the dayand that'd be great I do want to leaveyou with a story so I'm a photographer Ihave been my entire life I started offwith uh you know those disposablecameras the yellow ones when I got tohigh school my dad gave me this which isa yashika SLR that he had had when hemoved from India to the statesum and so in high school I I use thistook a lot of photos was in the uh thedark room processing my photos and allthe rest of it well for those of you whodon't remember when we had film you onlyhad 24 exposures on a roll of film andprocessing that film and developingthose photos took a fair amount of timethis really made you be judicious inwhich pictures you took because youwanted to be thoughtful about oila haveso many in my role oh you know theexpense and the tediousness of goingthrough and developing and processingand making these photos you know was alot but nowwe have photos we have cameras excuse mein our pockets digital cameras on ourphones completely changes this right Ihave an unlimited amount of storage onmy phone and in Google Cloud for myGoogle photos that syncs with Nest hubsso the photos that I take that I sharecan immediately show up in the livingrooms of the grandparents of my two kidsthey love this and what it allows me todo is see exactly what photos I take inreal time I can tell immediately if thekid was smiling or scowling or making aface I can tell immediately if I wasshaking or my finger got in the lens orall the rest of it in real time I cantell the kid go sit smile we're doingthis again or I have captured the momentand we can go onthe outcome I want hasn't changed in the40 years of my life I want to captureand share the memories that matter withthose who love my kids the most rightand that's exactly what we're doing withreal-time intelligence we're takingadvantage of new technology to solve thesame problems but with totally differentprocesses that transform the way wethink about it that eliminates some ofthese barriers that allow us to achievethose outcomes faster and with much moreconfidence so I'd love to leave thatwith you think about the ways wherethere aren't incremental improvements bygoing from batch or micro batch to realtime think about the fundamentalassumptions that you may have that nolonger apply in a real-time world that'sthe power of real-time intelligencethank you so muchforeign"
