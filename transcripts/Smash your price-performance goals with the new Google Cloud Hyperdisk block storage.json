thefeatures and products we've been workingon some of the products we'll belaunching that will help you run yourworkloads with high performance lowerTCO and better data protectionbefore we go into those details ofhyperdisc and other features wanted totake a step back and share some of theinsights that have been driving howwe've been designing the next generationof Google block storagewe've been talking to customers in ourcloud and on other hyperscalerswe've been talking to customers thathave been coming from on-prem and thosethat started in the cloudand what we heard relatively uniformlyis that block storage is still an areawith a lot of gaps with a lot of painpoints and a lot of challengesblock storage tends to fall short inthree key waysperformance is hard to achieve and scaleis hard to achieve in that performanceis still typically tied to instance typeand sizenumber of volumes and other factors thatdon't mesh directly with workloadrequirementssecond efficiency can be elusive youmanaged the the this capacity at thedisk level instead of at the overallcapacity Storage level and and the rightsizing is toil sum and error proneand third there's a lack ofcomprehensive data protection featuresin particular we noticed some gapsaround low RPO RTO Solutions and theability to have cross-region disasterrecoveryso when we said aboutto build the next generation of blockstorage we wanted to have something thatcan really fully live up to the promiseof cloudblock storage that is workload optimizedproviding the performance you need whereand when you need it block storage thatis effortlessly efficient allowing youto hit the TCO goals without complexmanagement overheadand finally that is instantly protectedoffering you all the key data protectionfeatures that you need for your missioncritical workloadswe introduced Google Cloud hybridistabout a year ago it's built in atitanium tiered offload architectureyou've heard about earlier today andwe'll hear more about tomorrowhyperdisc fundamentally decouplesstorage processing from compute muchlike a private Cloud San but with allthe elasticity and economic benefits ofrunning on the cloud service it allowsyou to easily and dynamically tunestorage to your workload you get higherperformance higher efficiency and higherflexibilityfrom a product standpointwe have a whole portfolio of differentvolume types that cover the fullspectrum of the different workloadrequirements you see for networkattached block storageall of these decouple performance fromcapacity all of these decoupleperformance as much as possible frominstance type and size and they'reavailable on both GCE and gkehyperdisc balance is our next Generationgeneral purpose SSD typehyperdist throughput covers HDD styleHigh scale high throughput low cost fordata scale sorry Big Data scale outAnalytics and on the other extremehyperdisc extreme covers the highestperformance for for emission sensitivesap Hana SQL server and Oracle databasesjust a few months ago vg8 hybrid isExtreme and hybridized throughputtoday we're announcing three keyadvances for hyperdisc first we'reannouncing the preview of 500 000 iopsand 10 gigabytes a second on IPC streamsecond we're also pre-announcing thepreview of hybrid is balancedand third we are announcing a muchbroader availability of hyper distributwith the addition of 19 zoneslet's dive a bit more deeply into howhyperdisc allows you to run your yourworkloads more optimized and to easilyand dynamically do storage to yourworkloadfor your most demanding workloadshypothesis extreme offers the bestperformancewith 500 000 iops in preview we'reactually amongst the highest performanceof all hyperscalers on the cloudis provisioned dynamicallyand you can tune that within minutesso there's only a single pricing tier soat the end of the day for commondatabase workloads we expect customersto see a TCO advantage of up to 40percentas I just mentionedhybrid is balanced is in preview now itis sorry in preview next monthit will offer twice the performance ofthe of the the PDA balance and pdssdvolumes that it replacesimportantly it brings a lot of thatperformance to much smaller instancetypes with just over a hundred thousandiops on C3 instances with 22b CPUsthat allows youto really look at what the storagerequirements are and the workloadrequirements are in terms of CPU andmemory and from I think we'll find formany database workloads you wereupsizing the instances to hit the iopsrequirements instead of looking at theactual underlying database CPUrequirementsif you include both you know the theright size of the instance type and andoftentimes the the corresponding rightsizing of the licensing costs thatreally leads a drastic improvement inTCOand finally hypers balance offers thatperformance at a single volume sothere's there's no gymnastics aboutaround managing raid arrays or managingthe performance of a workload acrossmultiple volumeshybrid is throughput runs out ourportfolioit offers cost-efficient high throughputfor scale analytics for streamprocessing and also for tiered storagearchitecturesyou can tune the performance all the wayfrom 10 megabytes a second per terabyteto 90 megabytes a second per terabyteand so what you'll find I think is thatI produce throughput offers essentiallythe flexibility the durability the easeof use of block storage at a cost pointthat is in the right ballpark of directattached HDD or even object storageso hyperdisc volumes offer Marketleading performance and TCO but bythemselves they don't actually fullytackle the efficiency challenges youhave in Block storage in the cloudto truly live up to the promise of thecloudyou need a way to enable effortlessefficiencyto achieve High utilization with littleoverhead and management complexitytoday achieving that efficiency is veryhardeven though cost optimization is on manyof our mindswe're stymied by the fact thatin the environments typically run withsubstantial under underutilizedresourcesbut because this capacity is tied to aVM and capacity generals manage to be atdisksaddressing this via right sizing istoilsome and complicatedsecondprovisioning by disks leads tounpredictable coststhat are hard to plan and budget for soif you're running ad cost infrastructureyou're usually running a dedicated teamof planners just to figure out how thatstreams through your systemand third managing a fleet of disks thatare backing multiple different workloadsconsistently and with processes iscomplicatedon-prem you'd use storage pools andSands to address these challengesbut in the cloud such pools have notbeen available so farwe're excited to announce hybrid storagepoolsin preview todaystorage pools allow you to manage toprovision and manage your capacity andAggregate and then to thinly provisionvolumes from those storage poolsimportantly the hybridisc volumes in thestorage pools behave otherwise likehyper disk volumes would be outside soyou don't have to adjust your workloadsto use storage poolswe believe you'll find that hybridstorage pools are the most costeffective and the simplest way to buyand manage the Box Storage in the cloudlet's go a bit deeper today if you'rerunning a workload say you know with ahandful of disksyou're looking at planning andprovisioning and buying the disksseparately right for each one of theseservers you look at the data that'srequired you look at temporary data thatmight be hitting that disk you look atwhat buffer you want to account for interms of growth of that diskwhat happens is that while you're onlyutilizing a fraction of the totalresources you're provisioning and payingfor every single one of those disks inaggregatewith storage poolsthe workload continues to see normalhypertensive volume they have the sameapis the same performance the samedurabilitybut as the disk writes data it actuallypulls capacity from the poolsand so your pool can be sized muchcloser to the actual aggregate requireddataon top of that storage pools offer datareductionso with further compression anddeduplication it further reduces theamount of capacity that you need to planfor in your workloadsit really varies but we found that ifyou assume typical utilization levels inthe fleet out there if you assumetypical compressive compression ratioswe expect you to see around 40 costreduction by using storage polessoworkload optimized storage on the onehand storage pools for effortlessefficiency on the other hand that'sthat's two pieces to our puzzle thethird one then is of course is assuringthat all of your business critical oryour mission critical workloads have theright data protectionas I mentioned earlier and this onebuilt all the way at great as Imentioned earlierum customer conversations revealed threeareas where Cloud offerings today arefalling shortone is around the ability to radicallyshorten the backup and restore Cycleslowest RPO lowest RTOthe second is a way to easilyconsistently offer ha and across ZoneHigh availability setupand the third one is built-incross-region disaster recoveryto provide geo-redundancy for workloadsthat need the highest disasterprotection for example due to RegulatoryCompliancewith instant snapshots with regionaldisks and async replication we'reoffering all of these and all of theseare first class built-in Primitives youhave data protection with Simplicitybuilt inand this is the one I need to build allthe way outpause there we go so today mosthyperscalers have the capability tobackup to back up your data in minutesbut the restoration of that data oftentakes minutes or even all the way up tohoursthat's because most of the existingfunctionality is optimized purely forthe disaster recovery use caseon gcp with instant snapshots customerscan take snapshots and restore data setsalmost instantaneously to cover a widevariety of use cases Beyond just thecanonical disaster recovery thisincludes things like scheduling backupsperiodically and rapidly and then doingbackup verification with a minimumamount of latency and and rprdoor capturing restore points before plantmaintenance or upgrades to be able toinstantaneously recover should thatsomething go awryor a quick recovery from from humanerror or from application softwarefailureinstant snapshots offers RPO of secondsand RT of tens of seconds 100 timesfaster than our competition and are fastenough that you can include them in mostworkflows and have data protection bydefaultah there we go I'm sorry the builds withthis clicker are a bit difficultumsecond for customers that need thehighest availabilityuh for their business and Missioncritical workloads we have Regionaldisks with rpo0 and RTO secondseach i o is written both in the primaryand secondary Zone before theacknowledge to the VMsetting up and deploying ha is a matterof clicks and it is application agnosticso you can run the same set of of disksand it's the same processes consistentlyfor all your workloads whether they'remy SQL SQL server or custom in-housestepsour customers actually deploy a widevariety of workloads across that wholeSpectrum using Regional disks becausethey're fully application agnosticfinallyasync uh sorry finally cross regiondisaster recoverywith an RPO of one minuteour synchronous replication offers fivetimes better data protection within ourcompetition with minute by minuteallowing a checkpointed data set to movefrom the primary region to the secondaryregionthis enables more granular protectionand it minimizes the amount of data lossin the event event of an outage ofdisasterof course a robust Disaster Recoveryplan requires frequent drills to ensurethat your processes that your workbooksare accurate and lead to the correctresultswith their built-in uhability to clone data disks rapidlyso you can perform frequent innon-disruptive Disaster Recovery drillsall right sowe are having builds again all rightso bring this all togetherwith hypertis volumes storage pools andour new data protection features we haveworkload optimized storage that iseffortlessly efficient and instantlyprotectedwith hyperdisc extreme balance andthroughput you get the performance youneed when and where you need it withstorage pools you can instantly achieveeffortless efficiencyand finallywith instant snapshots with regionaldisks with an AC and with asyncreplicationregardless of your data protection needswe've got you coveredwe're excited to see how it uses hypersvolumes storage pools and our data newdata protection features in new ways toscale optimize and transform on thecloudsowe can skip through this as always we'realways always listening to feedback youcan find the survey in the app as I'msure you've heard today
