in and thanks forhanging in to the very last presentationof the daywe're going to talk about mobilizingdocument insights with genitive AImy name is Derek uh Kieran and Jonathanwill be co-presenting todayKieran and I are product managers atGoogle Cloud within the document AI teamand Jonathan is a data science managerat Deutsche Bankwe'll give an overview of document AItalk about our genitive AI poweredroadmapthen we'll dive into a couple productareas document AI workbench Kieran willgo over warehouse and then Jonathan willshare the document automation Journey atDeutsche Bankthen we'll close with some q aso let's dive into the overviewdocument AI helps you tackle theend-to-end Journey of documentprocessingso not only can you read documents youcan help you can understand them fromdocument AI by classifying documenttypes extracting fields from documentsproviding spatial structure of adocumentsummarizing document contentand more and all of this structured datahelps you ultimately make documentsusefulso maybe you want to run analytics ofcustomer feedback within a formmaybe you're using an application formas an input to make a decision and aprocess or maybe you want to searchmetadata within your documentsultimately document AI can help youunlock insights and drive automation ofa process that involves a documentso how does that translate into outcomesfor your organization one structureddata can help you drive automation toimprove slas and reduce costsand with minimal AI experience you canuse document AI to quickly structuredataand lastly you can manage the documentlife cycle including storing organizingsummarizing and searching your Corpus ofdocumentsso we're delivering business valueacross multiple use cases a few of theminclude reducing the time it takes toprocess expense reports by 90 percentsaving up to 95 percent of processingtime for mortgage applicationsand reducing the manual processing timefor public sector applications acrossfederal state and local agencieshere's a few of uh customers that we'rehelping in their document processingJourney for example we help workdaystructure data to automate procurementand expense workflowsand we help BBVA structure data toautomate processesto provide the best experience possiblefor their banking clientsso in summary the document AI portfoliohelps you digitize structure and managedata in documentsspecifically OCR can help digitizedocument text layouts and quality scoresand many data scientists are using OCRto digitize documents as an input tocall generative modelsour pre-trained models help youstructure document data for example formparser uses the spatial structure of adocument to identify questions andanswers in a form and then return themas key value pairsare pre-trained models extractpredefined fields from a document like adriver's licenseand you can actually improve the qualityby adding documents into the trainingdata setfor your exclusive useand we'll be diving into workbench andWarehouse so we won't spend much timehere but ultimately they help youstructure and manage dataso now that we've given this overviewlet's talk about how document processingchanges with generative AI we see threecore benefits from generative AI one isyou can classify and extract data fromdocuments fasterbecause you no longer need to train adiscrete model per tasksecond you can unlock new insights fromfeatures like document summarization andquestion and answerand then it generated AI can helpimprove the document life cyclemanagement with features like searchingand summarizing across a corpus ofmultiple documentsso we plan to help our customers unlockthis value and that's why today we'reannouncing uh generative AI poweredfeatures within document AIso first generative AI powered searchacross a corpus of documents isavailable in preview and document AIWarehousegenerative AI powered extraction andsummarization within document AI isavailable in public preview withinworkbenchand in the coming months we plan tooffer other features like generative AIpowered document classification andquestion and answerand we offer we also plan to offerdocuments as a modality in thegenerative AI studio so you can discoverand explore document use cases withFoundation modelsso let's get into the specific specificsof these products we'll start withdocument AI workbenchso for context the current productworkbench is a platform that helps userstrain models to extract data fromdocuments such as a patient's insurancecardor classify documents to validate formsubmissions and decide where to store adocumentor you can split a really long file intoindividual classified documents like amortgage application and within one filethere's a driver's license pay stub W2and moreand today I'm public preview forworkbench we're announcing the customextractor with generative Ai and thesummarizerthe custom extractor with generative AIis in public preview and you can use itto extract data from documents withfreeform text like contracts or you canuse it to extract data from documentswith lots of layout variation think ofinvoices W-2s bills of lading utilitybills Etcor you can extract data from documentswhen you have little to no training dataavailableso why would you use the customextractor with generative AI one there'sreally fast time to Value you simplypost a document with Fields you want toextract to an endpoint and you'llimmediately get structured data inreturnand you'll be able to customize yourresults by simply confirming predictionswithin the document AI workbench dataset and then that context will be usedto improve your accuracy through Fueshot predictionand in the coming months will allow youto build a data set which can be used toperform parameter efficient fine-tuningdirectly through workbenchand you'll also be able to extractdocuments uh that are really long so 200pages in length for nowI'm going to show you a quick demo butbefore I go there let's talk about thesecond feature the summarizer so thesummarizer you can use it out of the boxwith no training required you can getsummaries for documents up to 250 pageslong you don't need to worry about themodel's underlying context windows orsplitting a document into chunksand you can customize based on yourpreferences for the summaries on theirlength and format and coming soon you'llbe able to customize results byproviding example documents andsummaries that meet your needsso let's switch over to the live demoand pray that Wi-Fi worksall right perfectso you come into document ai go toworkbench and you'll simply create acustom document extractor I'll use onethat I've already createdso you can see you can use this straightout of the box you can simply call theendpoint with a document with Fieldsdefined in the API call and you'll getstructured data in returnor you can go down a path to customizefor your specific needs you can createFields what types of data you're dealingwith and how often you expect them in adocument then you can upload a sampledocumentto preview results and Define fieldsso we'll go ahead and upload thisthere's a bit of a lag so I'll show youone that's already predictedbut you can see one minute into thisprocess I'm getting extracted valuesfrom this contract so the title thelegal parties the jurisdiction EtcI can create a new fieldand in real time we'll see a predictionfrom the generative model that will tellus how long we have to terminate thiscontract at the end of the term which is30 daysand also within workbenchif wechoose a term or a field that the cothat the generative model isn't able torecognize we'll see thatand we'll actually be able to teach themodel so this is the health and wellnessindustryand then when we mark this document aslabeledall of these predictions are saved ascontext including the correction that Ijust made so that the next prediction ismore accurateso I come into buildandI can now create a new versionand creating a version essentially savesthe fields that I just defined and thedocuments that I saved as context soyou'll have consistent performance inproductionyou can take quality to the next levelor do model evaluations by importingadditional documents and managing thedata setyou can use this Foundation model toautomatically label documents to helpyou build those data sets much fasterand then again coming soon you'll beable to fine-tune this Foundation modeldirectly here in workbench with thedocuments you build in your data setand of course you can continue to traincustom models which still helps fordocuments especially with low tomoderate amounts of variationso once you've experimented you can comein and see the versions that you'vecreated Run evaluations once you havetest setsand ultimately call an endpoint with adocument to get structured data backso that's how the extractor Works let'sshow you the summarizer so again you'llcome into document ai go into workbenchand go ahead and create a summarizerand again you can call this out of thebox to get summaries or you can go downa path of customization and let's justdirectly upload a sample documentand we'll be able to customize thisbased on our preferences for the summaryof length brief moderate comprehensiveor bulleted and paragraph then we canrewrite that summary play around withdifferentsummary formats and then choose the onethat best fits my needsand then we can come back and see thatthose settings have been saved and againcreate a version with those settingsthat will be used when you call thefoundation modelyou can also set those settings when youcall the individual API with a documentand again you can come in and see theendpointcall these endpoints with a document andget summaries in returnso thankfully the Wi-Fi held so let's goback to the slidesokay andwe'll skip these videos that were mybackupand we will goall right so again these features are inpublic preview you can go to workbenchright now in the console within documentAi and try it out a few of our customershave tried this out and let's hear whatthey're sayingwill use generator value and workbenchto extract data from new document typesincluding highly dense and unstructureddocumentsand they'll provide a faster moreaccurate and more secure service totheir banking clientsautomation anywhere helps customers withend-to-end automation through aworkbench they plan to use generative AIto help their clients extract andsummarize data for more document typesand get started faster than ever todrive business growth and automationIron Mountain offers an informationmanagement and content Services platformcalled Iron Mountain insight and withinthis platform they plan to use workbenchto help customers summarize documentsand improve their customer and employeeexperience by extracting data fromdocuments with limited or no trainingdataorbai offers an observe learn andautomate AI automation platform which ispowered by document Ai and rbai is goingto use custom extractor with withgenerative AI to offer faster time toValue customize results for higheraccuracies and help more customers Driveimportant outcomes such as 70 costsavings for Contract Processingcontextual AI offers contextual languagemodels which can be customized based ontheir customers knowledge bases andthey're turning to document AI toextract rich and complex data that otherextraction Solutions have failed tocapture for themthey plan to improve the extractionaccuracy with few shot predictions andfine-tune it and they will structuredata from documents with a more accurateand scalable approach that will be aninput for their clmsso a big thank you to our earlycustomers who've tried this out providedthe feedbackand finally we continue to invest in thecore product workbench a few of myfavorite features are automaticdiversity sampling to improve theefficacy efficacy of your training andtest sets and integration of our customextractor with bigquery so you cananalyze the data across your documentsand support for more advanced tablesso I'm excited to see what you all canaccomplish with workbench and with thatI'll turn it over to my colleague Karenthanks Derek hi everyone I'm Kiranbelari a product manager for document AIWarehouse so I'm going to spend the nextuh10 to 12 minutes talking about warehouseand then we'll talk about some customeruse casesso Warehouse is so what is Warehouseright so some of you may not be familiarwith it it's a new service that welaunched around went into GA around sixmonths ago it complements the rest ofthe dock AI portfolio very well what itis is it's a fully managed service tosearch to store govern and manage thedocuments but not just the documents butalso the extracted the classified themetadata we call them propertiesso it includes all the data that goeswith the documents all managed within asingle platformso this has several advantages overincumbent repositories that you may havecurrently you may be using so the firstis we apply the best of gen AITechnologiesto solve several problems right one isto be able to find the right documentthrough search a better searchexperience to answer questions that arethat may be buried in the documents tosummarize documents Etcand I can go over some demos on this alittle latersecondly we automate a lot of thedocument processing by supporting batchpipelines to process documents throughextraction classification Etcthird we store and manage thesedocuments at Cloud scale so we've hadcustomers with hundreds of millions ofdocuments right so you're not nottalking about thousands of documentswith really we're going to six and sevenfigures and eight figuresuh the next is really mitigating riskright so what does that mean so thecouple of things we do we enforcegovernance policies access control and adocument by document level we also uhsupport things like retention policieswhich are required in several regulatedIndustriesand thereby manager help mitigate riskensure compliance and then finally it'sintegrated with a lot of other Googlecloud services that you're probablyalready using dock AI being one of thembut also a bigquery GCS and we're addingother services as wellso as you can see Docker Warehouse canbe applied to is applied to a very widespectrum of Industries spectrum offunctions also different workflows andapplications as you can see so it's avery broad horizontal platform formanaging documentsuh we've seen a lot of interest fromIndustries like Banks insurancecompanies engineering companiessupply chain organizationsgovernmentHealthcare and Life Sciences but it'snot just that right it's a pretty broadplatform so you can use it for a varietyof other Industries and functions aswelluh so if you look at a typical lifecycle of a document through Warehousewhat happens is your document may beresident in any on-premise or Cloudrepository orit may be coming in through yourscanners or email systems it getsdropped into GCS and there areconnectors to do thatonce it's in GCS we have a dock AIpipeline that you can set up to kind oftake it through the dock AI processingoptionally through OCR extractionclassification Etc summarization use avariety of different processors that youmight want to use and then eventually itgets indexed into doc Warehouseso at that point we we index it we alsooffer in addition to our own UI we alsooffer apis and Trigger notifications sothat you can power your your otherworkflows and applications that might beusing these documentsso it goes beyond just our UI and itkind of helps power your businessworkflows as well and then finally itintegrates a big query through aconnector so a lot of the data that getsextracted and dropped into a warehousegets exported directly to bigquery soyou can run SQL views you can run avariety of otheranalytics run your bi dashboards to getinsights on the data that's buried inthese documents that would have beenburied in various repositories or silosokay so that's high level architecturewe recently launched a tight integrationwith Doc Ai and what we mean by thatit's a the slide looks a little morecomplicated than it really is they'rereally four touch points where weintersect with dock Ai and uh workbenchand the rest of the docker portfolio sothe first is running the dock AIpipeline right so we manage a scalablepipeline to bring in these documentsthrough extraction classificationsummarization Etc that's number onesecondly we uh also are able to take thepost hitl output so what happens is alot of customers use dock AI but thenthey have their own human in the loopthat's running on workbenchthe output of that even the loop thatcan also be natively extracted that canbe ingested into warehouse through thisPipeline and so some of our customersuse that to be able to verify theaccuracy of the uh the review or thelabeling or for audit purposes so that'sthe second use case third it can be usedas a data set management platformbecause a lot of the productiondocuments that are coming in it goesthrough dock here processing you stillwant to be able to cherry pick some ofthe search filter cherry pick some ofthe documents use that to export it toworkbench for further up training yourmodels so it's used for that and thenfinally the last one is extractingdocuments that have not gone throughdock a processes processing right sothat they may be resident and Warehousethey may be just blobs they might justhave a raw text extraction you want toapply like specialized processors or beable to apply some of the generalprocessors that Derek talked aboutso as you can see uh there's severaldifferent touch points with dock AI thatyou can use this forokay so let me jump into what we arereleasing now and what we recentlyreleased so we recently released a genAI search feature so this is uhthis this is quite very interesting soI'll talk through the right side of theslide which kind of shows a demo so whatyou see here is there are thousands ofcoveted research documents these arecompletely unstructured documents youcan ask a natural language questionthose get answered and basically webasically highlight not just the snippetof where the answer might be in the topfive documents so the three things itdoes first it finds the top five resultsthat might contain the answer ithighlights a snippet that might containit and then third it summarizes theanswer as it would appear in eachdocument so the answer summary isprobably where a lot of the value alsois because you eventually want to getthe some of these documents especiallyresearch articles or reports can getpretty dense in terms of finding theanswerso that's one uh in addition to that weenforce access control on thesedocuments so you'll only see thedocuments that you have access to whichis pretty important in a lot of usecasesand then this can also be used for doingthings like answering questions withsimple table lookups we support largedocuments as you are all aware there's atoken limit but these documents can farexceed the raw text can far exceed thetoken element because we do supportlarge documents as well and you can havelike annual reports you can have likevarious reports that exceed like 50 100Pages sometimesokay so that's generous search that weLaura launched recently today what we'reannouncing is a couple of uh otherfeatures on top of that this one is whatwe call Select document queries withinAI search so what what you're doing hereis we also support filtering ofdocuments so you can actually filterthese documents based on the metadatathat either extracted or you you mayhave human tagged by through humans orit may be pre-tagged sitting in yourother repository right so we support allkinds of metadataso you can filter these Down based onthe metadata and then you can basicallyselect these documents and ask questionsthat only cover the selected documentsand there's a few use cases for for itso for example in this case uh it's alegal firm that's current or it's maybethe legal department that's trying toidentify uh various contracts andunderstand the differences between thescope of uh engagement right if yourConsulting contracts so how does a scopediffer between these two contracts orhow does the term differ for example youcan get answers that kind of comparetwo documents or aggregate the get asummarized answer that spans acrossthese documents they have multiple usecases or you can even just select asingle document and query that rightthat that's also a very valid use casewhich many of our customers have askedforso that's one uh the other use case isaround summarization so Derek justtalked about announcing the geneaextractors and summarizers we do coverthe both of those in our batch pipelineso as you're bringing in the documentsyou can have them go through and that'swhat the animated demo on the left istrying to show is you're setting up thispipeline where you select a classifieryou can select extractors for let's saythere are 10 different classificationsof documents you can select 10 differentextractors some of this those could bemore traditional Docker extractors somecould be genei powered extractors andthen you can also have a summarizer thatbasically which would extract thedocument summaryand that summary is kept in a fieldwhich is kind of highlighted on theright side the the advantage of thesummarizer is basically now uh and we'veseen this a lot of users and analyststhey had to open a document to figureout exactly what it's about now thesummary kind of helps them get a quicksense of what so they can actually siftthrough 50 documents on the page andquickly identify the document they'rereally interested in because once you'vegot to run into like say millions ofdocuments you will find a lot of searchresults that are valid right so youstill want to be able to narrow downthese documentsso that's all I had to present uh let mehand it over to Jonathan who's going tocome and talk to you about uh documentAI at Deutsche Bankscaredhi everyoneum I'm going to give you a brief flavorof our experience using document AI atDeutsche BankumDeutsche Bank we receive many millionsof documents every year from our clientsvendors and other partners and theprocessing of those documents is largelydone in a manual wayum you know extracting information fromthose documents archiving and so on andthis obviously has the downside ofincreased costs and some sort ofhandling errors that we'd like to avoidso we're interested in automating thoseprocesses and we feel that document AIwarehouse and workbench are very goodcandidate tools for doing thatwe've at this stage completed a detailedevaluation of a workbench and our firstuse cases will be going into productionwith that um in in the coming month orsoum meanwhile ourinvestigations of Doc AI Warehouse arejust just beginningum beginning with um the extraction sideand uh and workbench and it's worthpointing out that an importantum Factor when determining what tools touse for this is the complexity of yourdocuments so forum simpler documentsum you know shorter standard formatdocumentswhat we found is that theum the workbench parsers the ml parsersfor extraction that you get in in dockAI are highly accurateum but worth noting that for forhigher complexity documents so eithervery long documents documents that havehigh variability free form documents orindeed just documents where you don'thave large samples to train modelsum they're in those circumstances thegenoi functionality that Derek spokeabout really comes into playum at DBum we've sort of started our dock AIJourney with documents that are at theirsimpler end and this is because that'sreally where we have the highest volumeof documents and therefore the highestcosts and so what we've really looked atso far is creating custom parsers usingworkbench rather than any of the thenewer gen III functionalityumwhat we have here is just an exampleform that we we've built a custom parserfor in this case related to cross-borderpayments but we'veum created parsers for many manydifferent documents in ourinvestigations and largely we see thesame kind of performance for all of themand on the right hand side here you seea plot of the extraction accuracies forthe various different data elements thatwe want to get out of this document as afunction of the training sample size andyou see that for already trading samplesizes of as little as 200 documents youget very high accuraciesand that's kind of a performance thatwe've seen with multiple document typescoming now to Doc AI warehouse atDeutsche Bank our main requirements hereare related toum sort of regulatory requirements thatwe haveum with retention and automated deletionof documents and also to do with scaleyou know we have the order of a billiondocuments and we want to be able tosupport 70 000 usersum of particular interest for us thoughare some of the uh the summarization andsearch functionality that Kieran spokeaboutum we're particularly excited by that atthe moment it's quite difficult for usto extract information and to gainInsight from from these vast number ofdocuments that we have and we feel thatby by moving to Warehouse uh we'll beable to unlock that potentialum in a similar way to what we'vealready done with the workbench we'rewe're starting to do experimentationagainst Exemplar use casesum for warehouse and that work is justreally beginningand of course what we're reallyinterested in isn't just solving for oneor two use cases and the real valuecomes from figuring out how to solve forone use case and then solving for all ofthe use cases that are of the samepatternum so we want to scale this upum now to many many use cases and wewe're going to do that by uh what we'vewe've created a shared serviceum that has a you know it gives accessto people from across the bank access toto those doc AI tools and other tools aswell and makes it easy for them totherefore use those toolsum we currently have about 14 use casesin our our backlab the first ones willbe going into production shortly andwe're adding to that backlogger all thetimeforeign"
