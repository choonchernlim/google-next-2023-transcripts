Americas I keptGemini and I'm Steve Jones I'm the EVPfor data-driven businessthank you guys we'll hear about you alittle bit lateruh so you've heard about generative AI Ithink throughout this conference so farand I won't surprise you when I say 70of global organizations are currentlyexploring with generative AI accordingto GartnerI could go into a bunch of reason whyyou should pay attention to thistechnology and to to these Solutions butthis is not this type of presentationso we're not going to cover what gen AIis and it's not will also not share whyyou should give it a try and I'mdefinitely not the person to talk aboutllms you guys had great demotedyesterday around harder technology workthis session is more about how you getyour Enterprise ready to take out thistechnologyhow do you protect your data and yourorganization there's a lot of feararound being like one of those earlyadopters that then met the the headlinesand then how did you play for the longgameand how we can answer this question isbecause capgemini we went through thisprocess right so we're going to use ourown experience over the last threemonths on how we ramped up ourcapabilities to actually like get up andrunning around gen AIso we'll share how we got started andwe'll have Jennifer share more indetails like practical applications ofgen AI will also share about how do youset the right foundations how do youreach scale and then where to go fromthemso basically we probably uh have been inthis position we were in this positionwhere do we startuh are we just like following all ofthose technology fed and it's not gonnabe for the long run so we had multipleways to go about it and we also had verylofty goals so at the top you see whatwere set up in terms of targets weneeded to basically get 65 thousands ofour Cap Gemini resources get excitedaround gen AI we wanted to by 2024 whicha library of 500 use cases and we alsowanted to have 100 MVPsand over the the last three months whatyou see as a result is that we were ableto get about 10 000 people to actuallycare about gen AI without with withoutour company and can train about it wenow have a library of 250 use cases andwe also have like demonstrable assetsum and you're probably trying to figureout like how do I reach an expert levelacross the globe and at scale how do Iidentify what is a good use case how doI prioritize and so on and how do Iactually work the talk in terms ofunderstanding how this technology workand go to MVPs so we ask ourselves allour those questions and to get to thoseresults basically it's maybe a recipethat you guys would want to take intoaccount is that we had buy-in from allthe lines of business from top down toreally mobilize the entire organizationwe also use that mobilization toprioritize where we would want to playengine Ai and what we would not want toplay right what are the key use casesthat we want to prioritize we alsocreated a Coe Global of a team ofexperts that can really guide us interms of putting those llms modeltogether there we did a global Summit togo after those 65 000 people and thenend up with 10 000 just for the firstthree months to get the volume of peoplethat canwalk the talk around Gene Ai and lastlywe did a global hackathon around thoseprioritized use cases to have really touse assets right and we're seeing someof our of our clients using that formulato bypass all of the typical like threemonths phases every time and accelerateall around so to talk more about thehackathon I'll pass it on to Jenniferthank youall right so first I want to briefly goover the hackathon by the numbers andthen and then we'll show some of theoutput of that so to start with we hadgiven ourselves two weeks to go throughthe hackathon it ended up stretchinginto into about three weeks from thestart of the first kickoff session wehad one thousand and 121 registeredhackers representing 29 countries so alot of interest in our organization toreally start playing with the technologyuh we also had 16 mentors and 16 judgesfrom kept Gemini and Google alike andthe output of that is we had 51 liveapplication MVPs coming out of out ofthe teams formedum so so very exciting uh and I'llactuallydo a a brief playback of what thehackathon process looked for like for usum to start with I'll introduce thethree uh top three winners so at firstplace we had a review aggregator so thistook diverse set of of customer reviewsand and aggregated it into one easy toread review for Consumer saving time aswell as providing feedback to productand marketing teams second place focusedon a human-like experience for travelplanning so an agent to help findundiscovered travel travel locations andpersonalized itineraries for those andat third place we have a chatbotmarketing agent so takingdata from the Enterprise and presentingit to marketing teams in aconversational format not requiring anytechnical expertiseso I'll play a quick video please[Music]welcome to gen III hackathon 2023 whatour product does is that it takes thereviews for this product and summarizethis this into a short form of contentso if we decided to filter removing thepositive reviews we can see what thenegative things are about this productso we can get a better feel of if thisis something I'd want to buy there's aneed for a solution that goes beyondconventional tourist attractions andCommercial recommendations one thatharnesses the power of AI to curatepersonalized and itineraries andguarantee experiential new adventures anMVP built using vertex AI Studio notonly able to gather valuable insightsfrom a data set but as well to createmarketing campaigns we call it thedesigner oh and there we gojoin the creative revolutionforeignso uh before we hop into the demo just alittle bit about our favorite MVP itfocuses on a store and historic conceptso so what we've done is we've taken thedigital human Avatar which which we'veall seen we think is pretty exciting Ithink it it takes it to the next levelby by adding generative AI uh to to thedigital human why so with digital humansconsumers are willing to engage a littlebit longer with technology however ourFocus Group found that a digital humancan go from hot to not pretty quick ifif the content remains staticso what we've done is we've usedgenerators and generative fallbacksalong with structured and unstructureddata to enable a store and a storeconcept so we started with the with thestore and store concept allowingcustomers to maximize their Channelreach with minimal investment we layeredthe digital human with conversational AIheadless Commerce apis on the back endfor a conversational Commerce kiosk andthen the degenerative AI expanded ourour capabilities in the ordering processto allow for open-ended questionsand allow us to more gracefully handleexceptions so I can find what's rightfor meuh so could you imagine using a digitalperson whether it's to to order orderfood at a at a restaurant whether it'sto return and learn about new productsor receive product trainingum at the edge in storeum you know you could use this at aretail store hotel lobby really takingthe contact center to the edge where theconsumer isum and and the the concept is as wellthe underlying conversational bot can beused in in additional channels withoutthe digital human front end so think thesame bot being used to to place the sameorder from your car from your Googlehome device from your mobile phoneso in this in this demo we're using theGen AI app builder chat info bot and thePalm uhlarge language model so let's take alookhellohi welcome to capgemini's Corner Shopstore in a storemy name is Casey and I'm a digital humanI can help you place an order or browseare you a loyalty member with usso so first I'm going to ask her aquestion to show the generative AIthrough Enterprise search so so we'veloaded structured and unstructured dataabout our business and you'll see thatshe she prepares and scripts theresponse based on thatwhat is a loyalty membera loyalty member is someone who has aloyalty account with usloyalty accounts let users accumulaterewards points which can be redeemed forin-store Rewardsis there anything else I can help youwithI am a loyalty memberplease tell me the phone numberassociated with your account404-123-4567welcome back Jenniferthe store located at 263 Onondaga Avenueis the closest store to youwould you like to order from this storeso now I'm going to ask a question thatillustrates the generative fallbackwhat am I supposed to doyou are on the store selection screenthe store displayed is the closest storeto youyou must select a store before food canbe ordered or menu questions can beaskedonce a store is selected the storecannot be changed lateris there anything else I can help youwithWhat other stores are nearbyhere are some other stores that areclose to youthe stores located at 5084 MissionStreet 2735 Baker Street and 3640Fillmore Street are the next closest toyouhello order from Baker Streetgot ityou're ready to order from 2735 BakerStreetyou ordered an iced tea last timewould you like to order it againso here we've we've personalized basedon the the loyalty member or you cansuggest popular items if if they're aguest userwhat's on your lunch menuour lunch menu has a cheeseburgerHamburger fried chicken tenders achicken wrap turkey club and frenchfriesso so this question and the next fewquestions again show the capability ofof the Enterprise search of generativeAI so it'll I'll ask some someopen-ended questions and it will directme to to the products that fit what I'mlooking foris there anything under 600 caloriesyes several items are under 600 caloriesincluding the fruit oatmeal chicken wrapand turkey clubhow many calories does the turkey clubhavethe turkey club has 500 caloriesdoes it have glutenyes the turkey club contains glutenwhat items are gluten freethe fruit oatmeal is the only itemgluten freeokay I'll take a fruit oatmealgot itI've added one fruit oatmeal to yourcartwould you like to add a coffee to yourorderso here we've we've taken theopportunity to to

havewe only have generic soft drinksyou will receive a cup and decide yourdrink in storeokay I'll take a sodagot itI've added one soft drink to your cartwhat else can I get you what's in mycartI don't have access to that informationhere you go she's just generative AIwhat's in my cartyour cart has one fruit oatmeal twocoffees and one soft drinkcan I get rid of one of the coffeeswhich item would you like to removeone of the coffeesno problemI've removed one copy from your cartokay I'm ready to check outyour total is 11.28would you like pay using your card onfileyesokay I have placed your orderyou should receive a text messageconfirming your order and Order pickuptimethank you for visiting capgemini'sCorner Shop store in a storeso here the digital person makes it moreapproachable and Google's gen appbuilder along with ccai makes thechannel reach endless with minimalinfrastructure so now I'll ask Steve totalk about how to enable this in theEnterprisethank you very much I'd like to pointout that was proves it was a real demobecause we even had the glitch in itum if anything we want to see more ofthe demo it's on the booth uh you canspeak to some of the developers behindit Carl Thomas and Charles who can gointo a lot more detail around whatyou've just seenand I think the piece really to talkabout in terms of the right foundationsis there's a lot of pieces to sort ofsay about gen AI where you say It'sMagic it's going to be great it solvesworld hunger it's not it's a newtechnology and it's a new technologywith some incredibly unique problemsthat you'll have to face and one of thethings you've got to think about is whatdo I need to do in order to be able totrust it to do business what do I needto be able to do so it represents mybrandso one of the things I need to startwith is what are the ethical principlesfor your organization when we saytransparent and explainable AI it's agreat thing but absolutely nobody inthis conference understands how an llmWorks internally and reaches anindividual piece but can I explain whyit did it can I bound what it did can Iensure that it does what it what I wantit to do within it and then explain howto repeat thatcan I make sure that is robust and safethat when it fails it fails safelygenerative AI gives an entire new set ofproblems that I have to deal with itisn't just pass and fail in testing it'spassbut maybe not because it's hallucinatesyou need to think about things youhaven't thought about beforeand that's where you take thoseprinciples you take those pieces and youthink about what does it take to reallybuild trust in AII'm not going to go through every singlething on this slide because I'd be herefor four and a half hours but I'm goingto pick out three number one is there anaccountable owner if we're talking abouta future world in which 50 of the workin an organization or more is done by AIthat still means that human beings havea hundred percent of the accountabilitythere is no ability for a company to gooh I didn't mean to order 5 000 of thosethe AI did it can you just let me offthere is no piece that says okay itmight have insulted you but it was justthe AI that did it it wasn't really acustomer rep there needs to be anaccountable owner to ensure that the AIis actually taking responsibilitybecause the only responsibility an AIever takes is the responsibility aperson forces it to take if you fire anAI the rest of the AIS don't learn aboutitsecond piece ethical data sourcing withllms with generative AI do you have thepermission to use the data for thepurpose that you are using it are youallowed to do it and can you prove thatyou are allowed to do it you don't wanta court case where you've got this bigmodel that you're relying upon or a bigKnowledge Graph that you're relying uponand not be able to prove that theinformation within it that you're makingdecisions upon you've actually allowedto have and that final point of provingdecisions can you prove that you tookthe most effort to make sure thedecision was correctcan you prove you're in control of thedecisionthere's a lot of other things in thereas well but I'm not going to go intothem todayso then the point is reaching scale aswe talked about the start with thehackathon we went from having a largecommunity get 10 000 people engaged thenbuild a huge number of MVPs and then afew weeks later be standing on stagedoing a demo of something that wascreated in a very short compressedperiod of time you can achieveincredible things very quicklytherefore the question is how do you dothat repeatedly when we talk about llmssome companies a few companies likeGoogle are going to build their own LMScompanies are going to specialize thosethings they're going to exist mostpeople are going to use Foundationmodels what does that mean you need tohave the answer is you need a knowledgemodel when you think about that demoyou've just seen all of that isn't inthe llm the Palm model didn't know theprice of things it didn't know what wasin the cart that's an API call that'sinformation about the organization aboutthe products that said whether it'sgluten-free and how many calories it hadin it that's the knowledge modelconstructing a knowledge model alongsidean llm is how you bring your corporatecontent securely into the businessprocess into the engagement with the llmunderstanding how your business actuallyworks how things relate to each other ina way that we communicated through llmsthat then brings into everybody'sfavorite term right now promptengineering or prompt Whispering thefact that how you tune and how you talkto an llm changes it the model and theprompt Hub is going to be something youthink about the testing and Trust layertesting generative AI is not liketesting anything else you need eviltesters I know the matter of Google andwe're here today is don't be evil butyour testers for generative I have to beevil they have to set out to poison themodel they have to set out to push itsboundaries to ensure it stays withinthem those are the guard rails that'sthe orchestration layer have you put inplace the things that stop it going offgenerator value is fantastic at doingdemos that are positivebut you need to do the demos that arenegative you need to test that you can'tdo negative things with it as well sohaving those guard rails that controlthe boundaries of negative is incrediblyimportant and then on top we all talkabout voice we all talk about thegenerative ux and the voice and the LMSthey are fantastic and magical but thatdemo also had a generative ux displayingjust a simple bar of products a simpleset of buttons a simple set of thingswhich actually was part of the userexperience which is created bygenerative AI so generative ux isn'tjust about voice it's about the wholemultimodal experience when you'reengaging in non-linear conversationssitethe thing about generative AI I wouldsay is if it was just about building abetter chat botit wouldn't actually be that interestingthe question regenerative AI is whybotherputting real effort into itif it is just doing chat Bots and theanswer for that is well there reallyisn't any point but the thing aboutgenerative AI is it's a lot bigger thanthat it does a lot more than that andI'm not going to read the things thelittle things that you can't read thetext on and don't worry I'm not going togo into those but in terms of what I'dsay is when people start running on thechat bot they go right we can do chatBots we need this advertise I mean thisentire 360 winner go through and youprobably already thought about it you'vegone we're going to do service tickets agreat one we do customer service we'regoing to do automate our customerservice using an avatar and that's afantastic thing to look at but I'll takea 10 BET with everybody in this roommaybe not 10 one dollar bet whatever inthis ring and say that actually whatyou'll find is when you go and look atthe data that your humans todaythe customer service reps who do areally good job and fix problems whenthey fix a problem they document fixedproblemcustomer issue resolvedand the call has ended and everybody ishappy and we move on on our way and wehave no documentation about the positiveoutcomeswhen we fail to fix something we make alot of documentation explaining why Icouldn't fix it what I tried to do tofix it why it isn't my fault that Icouldn't fix it and therefore don'tblame me that it wasn't fixed so I havehuge amounts of volumes of data that Icould automate not fixing things reallywellwhich is probably not what you're tryingto do the great thing about Jennifer Itherefore is you can say well how can Iget the information on what actuallyfixed it well I can take my core historyI can take my GitHub repository changesI can take my code and system changesuse that together to create a summary ofthe call present it back to the core repand go is this how you solve the problemyep great I've now got information whichis about positive outcomesby using that information on positiveoutcomes I can actually now improve myautomatic assistance then I can startlooking at a full Avatar one of thethings I would absolutely recommend toeverybody when you look at this is makesure you've got the data on positiveoutcomes before you try and automatenegative outcomes incredibly quicklybecause one of the things you canabsolutely do with generative AI thanksto hallucinations and all of thosethings is very quickly badly automatenegative outcomes another piece thateverybody talks about is they go codewe're going to improve the life ofdevelopers and I speak as a developerand it's great it's going to improve itit's gonna be fantasticwhat will happenwhen we improve developmentis the same thing that happens whenwe've improved development throughoutthe entire history of development we getasked to build more complicated thingsnever in my career has somebody saidSteve that thing you built becauseyou're really old in 1995. can yourebuild that tomorrow and we're going tohave the same size team that you had in1995 building that system and you'rejust going to take just as long andwe're going to pay you just as much todo it the system I was building in 1985I could probably build in a couple ofhours using a point-and-click GUI thesedaysthat is not what I get asked to buildtoday so as we automate code we getloads of generative code what does thatmean I've got a more complicated systemwhat does that mean the real problem isif you've generated a huge amount ofcode the answer is testingyou're going to have a much morecomplicated system to test so one of therecommendations we'd make is look attesting as a starting point to drive andimprove your sdlc generative testinggenerative AI is phenomenal at testingJennifer I didn't start in November lastyear Jennifer and I started about 2014with a thing called generativeadversarial networks withI won't go into the whole science of itbut the idea of actually how yougenerate content and how adversarialNetwork work there's a thing within thatwhich is a very early piece that wasused which is synthetic data which isgenerating data llms now enabled us togenerate test cases so there are twothings that generally is phenomenal atgenerating linear code so give it an APIgenerate some test case phenomenal atthat and number two generating test dataabsolutely awesome at generating testdata the more generative developed codeyou have the more automated your testingneeds to be because the less your peoplewill understand the generative code if80 or 40 of your code base has not beenwritten by the people in yourorganization but they still have todebug it you better make sure your testharness is there to make sure you pushand test it and it's right intoproductionand in terms of the pieces on the Telcoand Retail these are some ways we thinkthat Telco and Retail are going to beimpacted by generative AI this isn'tjust a small change one of the ones andthis is the new version of this slidewhen I first did the version of this forTelco I'd said that generative AIsoftware-defined networks theconfiguration of networks is somethingwe could see being moved towardsgenerative AI within the next 12 to 18months and then a friend of mine Daveduggle phoned me up and said you knowSid 12 to 18 months Steve yeah um I'vegot a company and we're doing it nowwith some telcos do you want to have achat so we had a chat we're talking somecompanies around it so Enterprise webyou can have a look generative AI usedfor software default networks in Telcocommissioning of networks if you cancommission configuration of Telconetworks there's an awful lot ofconfiguration and provisioning you dotoday that you can move to generative AIfairly quickly so I'm not going to gothrough all those pieces the point is wedon't see this as being a little shiftfor the organizations we see this is afundamental change in the way businessis going to be done way back when thehistory lesson type stuffI was working with a little companycalled Googleon the first thing I don't know ifyou've heard of themum who on a little thing they had calledGoogle Apps Premier Edition it was thefirst SAS product they'd had that theywere launching to cons to the Enterprisespacewe at Camp Gemini were the first peopleto sort of work with them on it and wewere looking back then at the start ofSAS and the start of cloud and sayingthis is going to really change businessthis is going to change the way we workit's going to change the way we editdocuments it's going to change the waywe do CRM cloud is going to change datacenters and change all of that businessand way back then 2008 people were likewell maybe maybe not and I'd say itprobably took a decade before it becamenormal but cloud outplayed data centersthat SAS was absolutely the default forapplications generative AI is going tomove faster and have a bigger impactthan either of those two things and fora really simple reasonwhen we talked about the context withthe demo and we talked about the factthat it understood the conversationyou'd had before it's building up adigital picture of your organizationyou're integrating that digital contextto be able to display that to be able toenrich that to be able to use that fordecisionsif an organization has a digital twin ofits organization and can actuallyunderstand its current operationalcontext that organization can alreadymake better decisions that means I canput on top of it generative AIS thatlook at things like supply chain onnetworking and say in the operation sideand actually look at how we can adaptand reconfigure and respond to thatmoving context My Consumer Avatar movesbeyond the stage of just being in termsof making recommendations of sales toactually a lifetime engagement with mycustomers every single one of mycustomers has a lifetime engagement witha single instance of the Avatar whichremembers them this is something if youwant to scare your Chief marketingofficer is you will have an avatarand then they'll change their brandingin two years time and your customerswill go you can't kill that Avatarbecause they will anthropomorphize thatthey will believe they have a personalrelationship so if you phone up and thevoice is different or the face isdifferentthen that person will get won't go ohit's okay they've run out of brandingcampaign it's they just killed theAvatar that I've been talking to for thepast two years that's a change in howbusinesses can be done and it's a greatway to terrify your CMO by the wayand in terms of what it means from agenerative AI perspective if I've gotthat digital context if I'm pulling inexternal information from the market I'mable to pull in something that says thisis what the market conditions are thisis what traffic conditions are this iswhat prices is this is a resourceavailability I know my context when Istart managing my organization what doesgenerative AI enable me to do back tothat point on synthetic data instead ofjust forecasting the future and saying Ireckon we're going to get I don't knowfour percent extra sales this quarter Ican simulate a quarter simulate economicchanges within that quarter simulateproduct availability changes within thatquarter simulate marketing campaignswith that in that quarter and see whatis most likely to impact my sales so Ican war game out my business for thenext quarter rather than simply forecastit and hey Lads let's go for itthat's a change in the way you dobusiness so we don't see generative AIas being simply something that moves theneedle in chat Bots or KnowledgeManagement or search it moves the needlein how you fundamentally manage businessbecause if you can move to a world whereyou have a digital twin of the businessthat means engineering of thatFoundation to a level where you haveaccuracy on your operational view ofyour digital reality you can simulateFutures and therefore dynamicallyout-compete the competitionthat's a different way of managingbusiness this is as different tobusiness today as cloud is the datacentersoin terms of how we see this in terms inthe futurethat's our view at Camp Gemini in termsof where we would say to go obviouslycome to the booth it's all great have achat with Kyle have a chat with Thomasto ask them more about what they did tobuild that Avatar because the thing Iwant to say about the Avatar thatJennifer bravely stood up and did thedemo of in front of a live audience isit isn't just about the llm when we talkabout the trustthe llm isn't the thing that got theprices the llm isn't the thing that gotthe gluten it's about building a systemwhich understands your business and isthen able to make the responses in theway the consumer wants to engageit's more than just an Ln it's about theoverall architecture sostraight after this pretty much howKeith and Co are going to be talkingabout how it impacts uh generative Aiand development cycles and all thosepieces tomorrow James my partner incrime on some work we're working ontogether is going to go through howwe're doing on reimagining the modernconsumer experiencebut the piece we really want to take atCamp Gemini is we went on a journey with65 000 people where we educated 10 000people well we spent three weeks andcreated over 50 MVPs and one of thoseMVPs we showed you today only a fewweeks later that is how quickly you canadopt generative Ai and see how it canimpact your business but the reason youdo it and the reason you think abouttrust and control is because this isgoing to fundamentally change the valueof data and the value of Technologywithin the organization if your businessdoesn't realize that shift others willdo and will out compete so the thoughtwe want to leave you is this very quickto adopt but you need to know how to gettrust and at some stage in the future 50of the work in your organization isgoing to be done by AISand the people at this conference arethe ones who have to make sure that thebusiness is still in control and that isnot a simple task[Music]"
