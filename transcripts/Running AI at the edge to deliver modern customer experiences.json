we're going to talk about todayall right so we are going toumstart with a quick introduction and talkabout why we built Google distributedcloud and talk about some of thebusiness challenges and the solutionsthat we've built in order to addressthem and we'll have a panel discussionat the end where we will have a set ofIndustry leaders who will share some oftheir learnings and experiencesso we will have some industry leaderswho are going to come and talk aboutwhat they have experienced with Edge andAi and some of the pioneering work thatis being done in this space and Sanjayis our moderator for this paneljoining me is going to be my colleagueNishant who is going to talk about whatSolutions we are building and I will betalking about some of the history andbackground on what got us here so firstI'd like to start off with why are wedoing this with Edge and how did we gethere and then we'll follow on with whatspecifically we're doing to address thebusiness needs of our key customersso I'll start with a little bit of ahistory lessonum although Edge as a phenomenon incloud is somewhat New Edge in terms ofhow the infrastructure and and systemshave been built at Google is not new soI'll share some lessons from historyfrom well over a decade agoin 2005 YouTube was created in 2006Google acquired them in 2007 uh Humanitydiscovered their love of cat videos andthen we found out that there's a scalingproblem in how the internet is built andhow user generated content getscreated and then distributed to all theusers across the world so one of theproblems we ran into early on is we raninto scaling challenges for the topologyof the internet itself so we had thecapability of having users generatetheir content and we had the ability tohave our large-scale data centers storethat content transcode that content andhave it available for consumption butthe issue we ran into was deliveringthat to the end user ran intobottlenecks on the connectivity betweenthe data center and the users on theinternet and so we started seeing wherechoke points that exist between whereGoogle's egress to the internet was andthe isps on the uh the links to the ispsat the end of which the users residedand so we had to take a first principlesapproach to how do we solve this problemyou had this phenomenon of bottlenecksalong the path between the source andthe destination but you also had thisinteresting attribute of videos where itgets multiplexed so you have one videothat is being watched by many userssimultaneouslyso the way we approach this was actuallyone of the first cdns that was builtacross the globe powering YouTube was uhwe essentially brought the cloudinfrastructure that was hosting all ofthese applications much closer to theuser and we spent well over a decadebuilding this infrastructure out andscaling it where we now have our coreservices for delivering video but otherapplications I'll talk about as welldeployed all across the world we have itdeployed with well over 200 countriesand regions many tens of thousands ofnodes that are all managed as adistributed Fleet of infrastructure sothis is the end state it took a lot ofwork and experience for us to get to astage where we can operate at this scaleso I'll just talk about where we're atnow and then share some of the learningsalong the way so we're at now is thisrepresents a large fraction of YouTubetraffic which is a large fraction of theoverall internet traffic so thisMachinery has been in place it's beentransparent to many of the users but itis critical to how content is consumedand internet services are consumedwhat we're starting to see is thiscapability has a lot in common with whatwe require for computing at the edge forthe new set of applications that requireus to bring Cloud to the users typicallywhat we've seen for public cloud isgrouping applications and workloads toCloud but there are scenarios where thatdoesn't work and Nishan will go intosome of the details of what what thosethings areI'd like to talk a little bit more aboutwhat we learned along the way so if youlook at many tens of thousands ofmachines deployed and managed by acentral team what we wanted to make sureis we can do this efficiently and atscaleso we had to look at automation fromfirst principles and from the ground upso we spent a lot of time looking atevery single user Journey from the pointof when somebody orders infrastructuresome from the point where it getsinstalled to the point where the day oneand day two life cycle managementeverything from software upgrades tofirmware upgrades to security patches torepairs and maintenance and managementof the software stack on top can behandled at scale and one of ourobjectives has been to be able to scalethe capacity that we managesublinearly relative to the number ofpeople that are required to manage itand so it's in fact the same team thathas been building this over the lastdecade or so that is now bringing thisto distributed Cloud Edge and I'll sharewhat we have built along the way so thefirst thing you have to think about whenmanaging a distributed Fleet is you'veprobably heard of this Mantra of cattlenot pets so it is not feasible to thinkaboutimperatively managed systems where youhave to look at each instance as asingle unit and manage them uh one byone you have to think of the fleet as awhole and you have to think aboutum mapping to intent as the first orderprinciple so one of the earliest thingsthat we did about declarative systemswas actually building thisinfrastructure out where everything isexpressed as where you want the state tobe and then you have a lot of machineryand automation under the hood that makessure that you reconcile to that statecontinuously so this is one of our firstforays into gettingumFleet Management and infrastructuremanagement at scale that gives you thecapability to manage very large systemswith very low resource overheadthe other aspect we wanted to maintainis maximizing developer velocity so as Imentioned we have many applicationsalthough I I touched on YouTube we'vehad applications running on this forexample for our messaging services andfor many of our connectivity Servicesrunning on the same platform some ofthem are mission critical for example ifit goes down it would lead to potentialsafety issues for people using thoseservices and another case is hey if avideo is not served locally you canstill route around that failure and gosomewhere else the same platform has tobe able to deal with those differentvarieties and scenarios of use cases soyou've got many developers working onthe same platform so you have to thinkabout division of responsibility at eachof the layers that enable developers tooperate independentlyum so a lot of the systems that requireum independent operation assume that wehave independent staging and rollouts ofeach of the software capabilities andthen have the ability to Stage that testthat Canary it before it rolls out atscale so that Machinery has beenoptimized over many years up to a pointwhere we're able to go manage thisinfrastructure with a heterogeneous setof applications heterogeneousenvironments in which it runs anddifferent form factors and deploymentsthat that need to be maintained a secondaspect is high availability so as Imentioned there's different classes ofapplications some of which are morecritical than others and so buildingthose components on top that allow youto engineer for the amount ofavailability on top of this substratehas been a first order principle so insome cases you have topologies that aredesigned for no single point of failureand you have mechanisms on top of thatwhich enable the operator of the systemto control when rollouts happen and whatsafety checks are in placeum and that is something that in factplays a very Central role when we talkabout distributed Edge because a lot ofthat control needs to be passed back tothe operator and giving them the controlofum when and how things happen on theplatform so whereas previously it wasGoogle running Google applications nowwhen we talk about cloud and customersrunning their applications we've had tobuild all of those capabilities as apisthat you yourself can manage and giveyou all the necessary set of degrees offreedom that that would be requiredwe'll dig a bit more into what some ofthose things are in the next sectionum the third aspect here is security soas you can imagine uh there's itrepresents a large attack surface and wehave assumed a zero trust principle fromthe outset we assume systems will getcompromised we assume that there will bea bad actor and we need to be able toprotect the system from uh maliciousactors and also applicationsum from affecting other applications sozero trust is baked into the system allthe way from how verifications happensat a hardware level to how binaries areauthorized to how rollouts and access iscontrolledand the last aspect aspect here issomething that is fundamentallydifferent with respect to how we manageour large-scale data centers and that'show we we manage the hardware and supplychain of this uh infrastructureum although Google cloud is now in manydifferent regions and countries acrossthe world the scale for Edge is uhessentially every population Center inthe world because the dynamic you haveto solve for is to bring compute towhere the users are globally one of thetechniques we've adopted early on was toactually have abstraction at thehardware level that gives you lots ofoptionality so we have worked with manypartners we've worked with manyintegrators and we've built automationwith their workflows and their supplychain that allow us to quickly easilyreplace that hardware and manage it asthoughwithout a lot of dependencies beingexposed from the hardware stack up tothe application layerso one of the final learnings I'll sharewith you is Edge means many differentthings and one of the particular aspectshere is when should you use Edge inwhich scenarios does it make sense touse Edge and in which scenarios does itmake to use in which nurses make senseto use centralized Cloud regions in gcpso I'll talk through this with anexample first and then extract some ofthe common patterns we think we can wecan infer from here the first is whereyou have large-scale data and where youhave requirements for statefulinformation to be managed and deployedwith large compute infrastructure thosegenerally tend to make more sense to runin cloud and the Other Extreme is whereyou have requirements where connectivityto a central region can't be guaranteedwhere you have sovereignty requirementsor you have restrictions or constraintsaround how you can scale theinfrastructure and scale the applicationfor example YouTube the example I gaveyou it makes more sense to distributethe workloadum and so those are the two extremeswhat it comes down to is having theability to select without a lot offriction on where to deploy yourapplication and make that a policydecision not an architecture decisionand so what we're starting to see now isactually with the emergence of AI a lotof data is actually generated at theedge and this is the inverse of what youwhat I described with YouTube you had alot of centralized data that needs to bereplicated close to the edge now youhave a lot of data generated at the edgeon top of which you have to dooperations and the similar a similar setofrequirements come into play and fromthat a lot of inference workloads a lotof high bandwidth workloads tend to bewhere Edge makes senseuh so this is a kind of a history of howwe got here and what we did and nowNishant will give us a little bit moreon what Solutions are being builtthank you HassanI think I'm going the wrong way allrightum as Hassan mentioned you know theseare the challenges that Google had todeal with now we want to look at howthese challenges are also coming acrossfrom our business or verticals thatwe've seen across the board you see alot of oracles on the slide we'veactually talked to many of thesecustomers they all share similarchallengescloud is great but as Assad mentioned alot of data is being generated at theedgecustomers are expecting new experiencesfrom different verticals for exampleretail they're expecting uh you know acheckout system that they can be drivingthrough or they're looking at otherengagement or visual inspection for ourmanufacturing floors for safety purposesand also for our government space theywant air gap offerings where the data iscontrolled in their environment and canbe managed across the board so as we sawall these challenges that are retailfrom manufacturing Healthcare that havea common form that they're seeing andchallenges how can we now bringcapability to Google Cloud to them atthe edgenow looking across you know some of thecore things we heard from our customersare hey regulations are causing us tonot be able to bring data to the cloudor a subset of the data can go to thecloud and subset has to live on the edgeor on my premises within either thegeography region location or my choiceas you go further you know connectivityis an issue I am sure all of you havebeen dealing with that today as thenetwork that we're dealing here we lostconnectivity several timesum you know on our Hardware so the showfloor GDC Edge continue to operate thebusiness continues to operate regardlessof connectivity sometimes not just theconnectivities the bandwidth that youneed to maybe push hundreds of thousandsof terabytes of data maybe that doesn'tmake sense so those are some of thechallenges we heard from our customersand then we're also talking about datavolumes you know some cases customersare generating petabytes of data at theedge you know think about yourautonomous vehicles that's generating alot of information does that all needsto be pushed to the cloud right awaymaybe not so some of these things thatwe've seen from our customers arestarting to make us think what can we doand deliver as an offering at the edgesome of the things that we've heard alsoaround Beyond just the operationchallenges you know what can we do togive that customer a new experience howcan we bring the AI capabilities that wecan do in the cloud to the edge to doinference and then do real-timetransactions or real-time predictions todo something right away and thenoperationally how do we help ouremployees on the show floor on theretail side or on a manufacturing plantto be able to operate faster betterinnovating and then be able to providethe capabilities that they need fortheir business to run fasterso fear not Google Cloud Edge is here tosolve your business problems and alsoyour customer problems so we think aboutwhen we build Google Cloud distributorand just you know Hassan talked aboutsome of the premises that theengineering team had to think from ourown needs but we took three foundationalthings three pillars that we thinkthrough AI at the edge or bill for AIwas one of the core foundations thingsso you know you can train your models inthe cloud you have unlimited resourcesgreat but then be able to bring thatmodel at the edge to run and do theinference and predict whatever thebusiness needs are is one of the corecapabilities that we think when we'rethinking about our distributed Edgeproduct then second is really aroundflexibility we'll talk about a littlebit more later about the options we wantto give not everyone needs the informfactor or same flavor every businessunit may need to have a differentbusiness use cases to meet theirbusiness needs how do we now providecapabilities regardless of theirbusiness operations or workloads acrossthe board so flexibility became a keyattribute for one of our pillars andlastly providing a rich open ecosystemthem we're not going to do it alone weneed Partners we need to be able to workwith our customers in some cases tobuild and deliver the solution we don'tknow your business better than you do asa customer you know what your businessneeds are what applications that youneed to run your business some casesyou're building your own application sowe want to be able to give you aplatform and be able to have thatavailable for you to be able to run thator partner with someone and we'll showsome of our partner ecosystem as wellfrom a form factor perspective this isour GDC family form factor and a lot ofthings are coming today we'll announcesome things in next slide I'll talkabout it but this gives you kind of thevisibility all the way from a small formfactor all the way to a data center typeenvironment or maybe you know meeting acountry needs so as we go through theGDC family we'll talk more towards justthe GDC Edge product portfolio today butwe have several form factors go checkout our Hardware some of the formfactors are available there for you tokind of see physically what's thereokay well that's great but what isavailable today we have kind of the twoform factors that we talk about for GDCEdge one is our single node system andthen we have a rack configuration tendsto be more lean for our data center typeenvironment where you have Power Coolingeverything that's needed for a rackconfiguration it comes with six serversyou know uh we have an FC vcpus memoryand footprint that's needed to be ableto meet your business needs and thenwe'll talk more around what's coming inthe future to be able to expand thathorizontally or worklyas we talk about today I'm excited toannounce our new form factor which isfor today for retail Edge use cases butthat same form factor can be met for ourmanufacturing use cases could be greatfor healthcare our target audience todayis retail because that's the solutionwe're looking to build we'll talk morearound at the hardware worse what thoseuse cases are but after talking to a lotof our customers a single node was greatbut it was great for pocs what abouthigh availability we want to be able torun our operations and have failureswhich will happen and not have to worryabout my business going down soavailability became a big challenge forus that's why this form factor makessense managing the hardwareinfrastructure is a key attributes ofGDC Edge we manage the hardware as wellas the software stack so that's one ofthe key attributes we wanted to bring tothe customer we talk about flexibilitythis gives you the flexibility you needto be able to have a smaller form factormaybe sitting in a back office or in acabinet or closet so we want to be ableto meet that business need and lastly wewe want to be able to provide you knowextensibility so you want to be able torun VM or containers you can have gpusor CPUs configurations so this gives youagain that flexibility I talked aboutfor a future direction as you saw theform factor slide we're going tocontinue to innovate in that same formfactor either if it's in a three nodeconfiguration or our large data centerconfiguration where we can expand eithervertically or horizontally depending onyour business needs this gives you abetter Roi for what your business needsso you're not stuck with the same formfactor and as a hardware ages we want toensure that we bring the newertechnology faster CPUs more memorydenser configurations for your businessneeds so you'll see a lot of a lot offlexibility from that perspective whenit comes to our Hardware configurationforeignstack there's a lot of featurefunctionalities I'm going to cover allof them but today I want to just callout some of the key capabilitiessurvivability mode which is continuouslysomething we're investing inconnectivity is great but as I mentionedtoday you lost connectivity we want tomake sure the business operations arecontinuing so we're making sure thateven up to seven days if you're notconnected back to the cloud youroperations don't stop you continue tooperate no matter whatsecurity is a big aspect Hassan talkedabout as well around the you knowBastion host features like boundaryproxies these give control back to thecustomer and visibility to the customerwhat data is being driven over the cloudto our Google Cloud what commands orcontrols are we sending to yourenvironment when we're doingtroubleshooting so all that governancecontrol comes to mind when you'rethinking about from a softwareperspective additional services will bebringing our dataproc service to theedge you've probably heard theannouncements of lidb services coming toour gdch family or product that'll alsocome to our e-family of products you'reseeing a Synergy across the portfoliothat we deliverand very excited to announce that we'recontinuing to expand GDC reach for ourGlobal customers so country El Salvadorwe're announcing availability of our GDCinstance this is the first ever in thegovernment of South El Salvador thatwe're providing a GDC offering wherethey can operate and drive the businessthey need and make sure the data for thesalvadorians that's created stays withinthe country boundaries and doesn't leavethat it gives them a great capability toneed whatever their country operationsmight be the back office operations thatthey want to provide to their citizensthey can now leverage uh you knowinnovations that we're doing with GDCEdge and work together with uslastly I talked about a partnerecosystem there's a whole variety ofpartners that we work with very closelyanywhere from a hardware vendor to atechnology vendor to an SI or Global SIall of these vendors are helping andpartners are helping us to build asolution that's needed to drive forexample rakutan is one of our partnersthat's providing extension to ourstorage component so I talked about ourthree node configuration or the rackconfiguration well if you need petabytesor terabytes or petabytes of storage apartner like rock attends helping usbring that to our Edge capabilityso on that note I would like tointroduce Sanjay Jacob tothe podium and he can reduce the panelthank you Nishanwelcome everyone my name is Sanjay Jacoband I'll be your moderator for the nextfew minutes we have a very distinguishedpanel of Industry experts who will sharetheir insights in just a few minutes onstage before we do that I'd like to tospend a few seconds talking about aquick recap of the GDC portfolio that wesay GDC it's Google distribute Cloudportfolio and connect it back to acouple important points that Thomasscurion mentioned a little bit earlierGDC as a portfolio is designed to be aunified hardware and software set ofsolutions it is built or they are builton the Google AI Advanced aibest-in-class ai platform along withsecurity as well as an open ecosystem wetake openness really really seriouslynow we do that so as to enable andturbocharge if you will the idea ofEnterprises and organizationswhether it's commercial or public sectorinnovating faster with more modernbusiness applications applications thatboth serve and create a betterexperience for not just consumers butalso for citizens in order to protectassets and these assets could range inimportancein addition we have flexibility that webuild as very very core so flexibilityin terms of deployment optionsflexibility in terms of giving you theindependence and the control so thatyour data lives exactly where you wantit to livenow I mentioned earlier aboutInnovations at the edge this is whatthis session is about there is anaccompanying session that is very verycrucial for the needs of public sectororganizations especially and regulatedEnterprises and that's the notion oforganizations who want the extremesafeguarding in terms of air-gappeddisconnectedEdge platforms and that's what weprovide the the session over there iscalled mind the air gap how the cloudenables digital sovereignty at the edgewe on the Google side are seeing a lotof interest from governments as well asregulated industries from here in theAmericas to Europe and to Asiaso we invite you to attend that sessionuh if you have similar needs now withoutfurther adoit is my pleasure to welcome andintroduce our distinguished panelGeneral common stageand if everyone can give a round ofapplause[Applause]welcome and thank you very much I'm justgoing to introduce our panelists SteveJarrett is the global head

applicationsinfrastructure and strategy welcomethank youso we have four questions ladies andgentlemen and they will range from avariety of teams that we know are verytopical and highly highly relevant towhere we are right now as an industryit'll go from data to modernization tosecurity and then to AI of courselet's start with data so analyzing dataat scaleanalyzing data at the edge and in datacenters can be difficult especially whendata grows to massive volumes andrequiring the high levels of securitythat it does how have you started toovercome these challengesso at Orange Sanjay mentioned that weoperate in 26 countries and in fact wegenerate over a petabyte of data a daythat's just the Telemetry data from thenetwork equipment and so you can imaginewe're not going to send all of that datato public Cloud so having GDC Edge asthis very Dynamic and flexibleenvironment where we can filter data andControl Data into a data operations isreally appealing for cost controlbut we also face changing regulatoryrequirements from country to Country andso again having a very Dynamicenvironment to manage that's usefulI think I'd also say that operationallythere are a number of cases where we'llwant to be able to shift how much datais going to Cloud versus that's stayingon-prem like maybe we're training a newAI model and we don't know what's goingto be predictive or there's a networkevent and we want to explore that sohaving this very Dynamic environment hasbeen really powerful for usforeignmaybe I could build on Steve's pointsand bring some of the Enterpriseexperiences we have had the finalclients uh one of the first insights wehave had is that some of the pioneeringEnterprises who brought AI to theirbusinesses led the very specific usecase driven implementation I think smarttraveling in retail or video analyticsin industrial production while thesedeployments were successful they werenot designed to support the Enterpriseneeds at scale so that's why werecommend for our clients and partnersto leave the platform design in mind andthe platform-based design allows you todo multiple things in a much moreelegant way first from businessperspective you don't need to invest inpoint Solutions and you can optimizeyour infrastructure across multiple usecasestoo and sometimes it's under appreciateunappreciated fact that as you generatedramatic amount of data as part of yourAI workloads it's very important toinvest in Automation and you can only dothat at the platform level versusspecific use case level and I would thatmaybe another point is I sometimes andthey appreciate it as well the humanfactor so as we introduce newcapabilities to the Enterprises it'svery important that the Enterprise couldevolve with these use cases and thatthen I mean change management traininghigh level of Automation and platformallows you to do thatyeah for Krogerum first I think it's so critical tounderstand the context so when I saycontext first of all or business contextas was mentioned we get to serve 11million customers every daywe get to support nearly a half amillion Associates every dayand we have to orchestrate all of thiswork at 2400 stores and the digitalexperience we're trying to provide soall these data sources coming in to thatstore many times or around that storeand so understanding the context of whenyou walk in and we want to give you thefresh produce that you want we have tobe able to identify the strawberries andlots of information about thosestrawberries when they came in wherethey're at in the store and making surecertainly that they're at the peak offreshness but we also have to separatehow we handle strawberries from theprescription you're going to fill andthe sensitive data that comes along withthat so we're trying to really work upfront to make sure we have the rightcontext defined well around the data andthen we handle it the appropriate waysexcellent thank you great great insightsover there we'll move to the next one inthe interest of time keep movingmodernization so modernizing Legacyinfrastructure we know that this is abig lift for a lot of customers and inthe extreme case it can actually hamperor impede the progress especially as weMarch towards AI for example how haveyou overcome some of those challengesyeah we were faced across thesecountries with a lot of Monolithic dataand eye infrastructure and so againhaving this really flexible environmentwhere not only can we run open sourcedata infrastructure but we can run opensource AI models we can use vertex AI totrain the models and deploy them at theedge but also the managed services sothe the announcement today about amanaged version of spark with dataprocthat gives usthe the infrastructure to allow us to doreally quite sophisticated dataoperations on premise and it allows ourdata engineering teams to focus onadding value as opposed to maintaininginfrastructure so that that was reallysignificant for us also your point aboutthe training is really valid I think itkind of Narrows the scope of the skillsthat we have to master across all ofthese different countries to maintainthese infrastructures that was also wethink it's going to be a big oneand just to build on Steve's Point uh Ithink as we approached the deployingvery Advanced Cloud native orincreasingly Edge native applicationwith all this uh think about thetraditional workloads that still liveand will continue to live in theEnterprise for quite some time so theultimate platform choice and theultimate application development choicethat you lead with should take intoconsideration ability to run both Legacyworkloads Edge native applications andthe cloud native applications in fact wewould argue that the magic of thesolution itself is the flexibility tosupport all these flavors of theworkloads and then that allows us tosupport the business and then allows thebusiness to gradually migrate theapplication stack to a different type ofform factor yeah I love sergey's pointand it's what we've seen at Kroger we'recelebrating 140 years this year and somodernizing and continuing to makeupdates for our customers and ourAssociates is something that's kind ofbuilt into what we do but also beingbeing really conscious over thoseInvestments and where they're at and soI think we're really focused right nowon offering new capabilities newfeatures that are both within store buttaking advantage of what we have withingcp and in our Cloud environments butalso then investing in things like datastreaming and how do we more efficientlystream the data out of the store when weneed to or how do we keep it in thestore and then let it live its life ifyou will there locally without theadditional cost of moving itexcellent thank you very much so keepingthis movingsecurity we heard from Thomas Koreantoday and he said it well there isnothing more important than safeguardingthe security and of the assetsevery organization every one of you hasdata that must be kept secure then whenyou add to scale as well as regulationsthose add further complexity to thewhole dynamic what are some of the waysthat you've approached this challengeso as you can imagine we have extremelystringent security requirements acrossmany of these countriesand one of the things we really likedabout the Google solution was the ideathat the the control plane is runninglocallybut also the Bastion proxy that wasmentioned briefly that's an open sourceproxy that we can run on our premise toinspect all of the bits travelingbetween the Appliance on premise and thepublic cloud and so if we see somethingin the boundary proxy on the managementplan that we don't like we can justsever the connection and so thatflexibility gave a lot of confidence toour security teams so that plus all theother security functions that you seethere for us the benefits of using thosethings in a managed way as opposed tohaving the team having to provide all ofthis infrastructure and manage all thisinfrastructure ourselves is reallyclearly beneficialyeah good to agree more and and thenwhat I would like to add is that as wethink about the securing uh The EdgeComputing infrastructure I would say fora three tenants that you have toconsider one is uh what I would broadlydescribe as the security features andcapabilities so Steve describes some ofthem so you have to have the rightTelemetry and tool set to enable it andin fact we would invite you to stop byuh Deloitte Booth to see some of thetools that we bring to our clients Ithink another element which is sometimesand they appreciated and Brian you talkabout different workloads at Krogerregulation so imagine in Brian's casewhere you have to comply and this happenwith PCI PCI compliance and as well assome of the other unique compliancerequirements for different type ofworkloads your solution your SecuritySolutions should be flexible enough toaccommodate them and then the thirdpiece which we invest heavily in isautomation at the end of the day youdeal with massive amount of datasignificant processing capital jewelriesand the only way to keep it securepredictable and reliable is to automatethe security posture of your solutionyeah we're looking at it certainly onthe manageability front very heavilylike these two gentlemen mentionedum and the 2400 different points that weneed to secure every day as well how thedata Flows In but more importantly whatdoes it look like as our developmentteams and as our Engineers push out newSolutions and new features and the levelof consistency but also the speed to getit out but most importantly I would sayin the security realm the speed torespond and so we look at what happenswhen we do need to respond to a securitythreat and it could it could be morethan just a cyber threat and do we havethe speed to respond as quickly as wewould like and that's where we're seeingthe platform provide a lot of newflexibility and capabilitiesexcellentdoing very good on time now for the lastlast but not the least everyone'sfavorite topicAIAI unlocks so many interestingInnovations and scenarios use cases allthe way from the connected retail storeto modernize the experiences on themanufacturing plant and so many otherIndustries so the potential to actuallyunlock new scenarios at the edge isimmense what are some ways that you'relooking to the Futureso at Orange we we like to say that AIgives superpowers to our employees andit also superpowers the network and itsuperpowers our customer interactionsand so we were very early adopter ofvertex so the idea that we can use thatenvironment not only to do modeltraining but also to do fine-tuning andthe deployment and management of modelsand now that GDC Edge is a target forthat where we can run inference ofmodels at the edge that's very veryappealing to us some of the use casesare we we have a we may have a largelanguage model that's fine-tuned that'sin front of a lot of very sensitive datathat we don't want to have leave thecountry so in that scenario we can runthe inference of that model on premisewe also you can imagine across the 26countries we have there's so manylanguages spoken so the idea that in thefuture we could have speech models tunedfor those local languages and again berunning inference in country as opposedto having what is effectively the pii ofthe speech leaving the country and andlike we have data residency requirementstoday in many of our countries wereanticipating AI residency requirementsso again having this flexibility ofbeing able to run AI model inference oncloud or on-prem is is is really usefulyeah and I would like to add that someof the benefits that AI brings to theEnterprises today are fairly evident soI'll just pick maybe a couple ofexamples at a very recent uh in our workuh in in industrial and Manufacturingspace we think uh there's a realoptimism right now about the ability ofAI and AI driven workloads to optimizenot just a particular part of yourbusiness operations but the operationsat large end to end so things supplychain optimization think real-timeinventory management I think about anindustrial context the throughputenhancements at the factory productionfloor the numbers we've seen the fileclients 10 to 20 Improvement a veryrecent use case that we I I'm glad toshare in automotive production space wehave used video analytics for QualityControl in industrial production spaceimagine the hood of your car that's beenpainted with multiple layers of paintability to check for Quality at everylevel and making adjustment to the nextlevel comes in is dramatic Improvementin fact some of our clients report 10 to20 Improvement in quality control byjust deploying this type of solution soso what I would like to share is thatthe promise is real the impact issignificant uh you and you have to startthis type of mindset to build a solutionthat not only help an Enterprise toaddress immediate challenge but helpyour clients and your partners to be onthat journey and to rethink how they runtheir businessso for Kroger we've started the journeyreally thinking about how do we supportour Associates that are in our storesevery day so that they can focus on ourcustomers that are in front of them theycan focus on the questions like where doI find this product or can you tell memore about this cut of meat or this newfresh produce and so that enables theassociate to be thinking about how do Iservice this customer in front of me onthe floor instead of having to possiblygo to a back room or to an office inorder to you know manage inventory orcomplete an order and so if you drill ina little bit deeper to that example itreally means identifying what is themost important activity for thatassociate to be doing at any point intime in the day which is really heavilydependent upon what's the state of thatstore which connects back to your supplychain which connects back to yourproducts it should be in the store andyour customers so really we see theopportunity of starting to take all ofthese different sources of data andactivities some which are planned somewould are very real time
