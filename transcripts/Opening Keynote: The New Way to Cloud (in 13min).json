that's been onThe Cutting Edge of Technologybreakthroughs be it from desktop tomobile to the cloud or now to AIand a partner who can help navigate andLead through them we believe that makingAI helpful for everyone is the mostimportant way we'll deliver on ourmission in the next decade today we areusing generative AI to reimagine theexperience and take more of the work outof searching we call this the searchgenerative experience or SG for short weare pleased to be the first cloudprovider to any enable digitalwatermarking and verification for imagesgenerated on ourplatform our generative AI products aredelivering Real Results in every singlediscipline I'd like to take a moment tothank the many customers who areannouncing AI Innovations with us righthere atnext Google Cloud's World leadinginfrastructure delivers very high andpredictable performance unmatchedreliability and the very best securitywe offer this infrastructure in ourCloud regions in your data centers withGoogle distributed cloud and on the edgewe're announcing our TPUv5e a new highly efficient version manycustomers use Google kubernetes enginefor AI workloads today we're launching anew product gke Enterprise to enablemulticluster horizontal scaling withgpus and tpus we're announcing thegeneral availability of our A3 virtualmachines based on nvidia's latest h100acceleratedgpus A3 offers three times fastertraining 10 times greater networkingbandwidth than A2 ideal for incrediblydemanding AI workloads we're introducingthe titanium system a next generationtiered offload architecture thatunderpins the performance advances inour AI infrastructure we're announcingGeneral availability of the nextgeneration of Google distributed Cloudwhich supports stringent connectivitysovereignty and Regulatory needs we'reintroducing a brand new service crossCloud Network to allow you to centrallymanage secure and speed up applicationsacross all your clouds and SASproviders all of these announcementsoffer our customers breakthrough levelsof performance per dollar at the highestlevels of reliability and scale Morethan70% of generative AI unicorns are GoogleCloud customers it's the first timemachines are speaking in human languagewe partner with Google Cloud to get thebest inference we can to deploy thesemodels to the next generation of storycutters today we're announcing anexpanded partnership with envidia we'reintegrating serverless spark with Nvidiaacceleration libraries and Nvidia gpusfor data science work closed with dataproc our two companies with two of themost talented deepest computer scienceand Computing teams in the world arejoining forces to re reinvent Cloudinfrastructure for generative AI theamount of work that we're doing togetherin AI software is really incrediblewe're so excited about the work thatwe're doing we're going to put Nvidiadgx cloud in gcp that's greatyeah djx cloud is nvidia's AIsupercomputer this is where we do our AIresearch this is where we optimize ourincredible software stacks and all ofthis work that we do will instantlybenefit gcp and all the people that workon it Fox Sports has been partneringwith Google Cloud for 3 years to

humanfeedback is your data and no one else's[Music]good morning San Francisco so firstwe'll start with the model Garden wemade a promise to you that we were goingto add thirdparty models open- Sourcemodels with our first party models andso you can see our pre-announcement ofClaude 2 and meta's llama 2 right herein the vertex modelGarden so here's the big reveal inaddition to our native sources of publicweb content big query in Google CloudStorage today we announce jiraSalesforce and Confluence for Enterprisesearch andconversation when you use vertex there'sno drama with thisllama Six Flag is helping the 20 millionguests who visit their theme Parx eachyear have even more fun with the newdigital concer in theirrapall of this is made possible with vertexAi and our foundation models trained ondata pulled from the Six Flag websiteand multiplearchives workspace has been bringing themagic of AI to our users for almost adecade todaythousands of companies and over 1million people are already using duet AIduet has been helping customers writevisualize organize and connect likenever before and now all of thesecapabilities are available to you withtoday's GA launch of duet AI inworkspace where seeing more and morecustomers switch wholesale to Googleworkspace we are excited to expand our DAi and Google Cloud preview with newcapabilities with General availabilitycoming later this year duet goes furtherby providing you an expert assistantacross your entire software developmentlife cycle duet AI in AP makes it fastand easy to design create and publishyour apis with du AI in big query andlooker you can use both natural languageand autogenerate SQL Python and lookl toaccess and analyze your data and now youcan do all this within our new big queryStudio a unified interface for dataanalytics with server list notebooksallo Tob aai provides PG Vectorcompatible search that is up to 10 timesfaster than standard post press whatmakes Google Cloud unique is we delivera combination of three musthavecapabilities first we have Frontlineintelligence andexpertise second we we have a modernsecurity operations platform and thirdwe have an underlying Foundation of asecure Cloud platform securityoperations teams can now get threhunting on their chronical data bymandian experts who use our latestFrontline intelligence to expose attackor activity before it negatively impactsyour organizations Google Cloud had 75%fewer critical and high severityvulnerability since 2020 than one of themajor Cloud providers ERS and 60% fewervulnerabilities than the other majorcloudprovider I'm going to show you threeways that duet AI assists you in cybersecurity by generating AI summaries todescribe threats by searching forpatterns in your security data todetermine if you've been affected and byrecommending actions to take both inresponse to alerts but also toproactively improve security by closingdown attackpaths we're working with many SAScompanies to bring our generative AItechnology to transform every businessprocess one of our most importantPartners is workday we're also one oftheircustomers proud to say that workdayfinancial and hrr applications are nowlive on Google Cloud we can uh take jobdata job location and skills andbasically create a very strong jobdescription and I mean it's cont Tgeneration like so much of the genicases and it saves a ton of time usingGoogle AI again to uh to basicallybuild uh or leverage our skills APIwhich is an inference engine that thencustomers can build apps for retentionand upskilling in in this new world ofof skills which is where all of HR isgoing so it's just been great to do allthis co-innovationtogether we're working with other SAScompanies including box canva docus signas well as Jasper sap andmore we're also integrating ainfrastructure vertex Ai and big querywith infrastructure and platformPartners we have thousands of thirdpartydata sets available from industryleaders in our data and AI platformtoday we're announcing an expandedpartnership with Bloomberg to make theirdata available in our data and AI cloudand as system integrated part partnersare investing to build dedicatedpractices and train more than150,000 people on Google Cloudgenerative AI in closing we showed todaythe three most important ingredientsthat'll power this next chapter ofdigitaltransformation one our worldclassinfrastructure and platform for buildingAI two are always on collaborator duetAI to help you use AI in both workspaceand Google cloud and three ourinvestment in your success across
