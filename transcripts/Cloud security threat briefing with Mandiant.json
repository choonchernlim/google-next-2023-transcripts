    "transcript": "foreign[Music]to the mandiant cloud security briefingum I amAndrew Kapinski I'm an intelligenceanalyst for mandian and Google Cloud Ispecifically work with people like JohnHolquist like Sandra Joyce mostly tofocus on what we call StrategicCommunications for intelligencethis really kind of focuses at itsEssence on how to tell all of the coolstories that come out kind of acrosssecurity all across across Google cloudand delivering those cool stories toaudiences like yourself internal andexternal as well as helping a lot ofpeople across Google Cloud tell all thecool stories that we findso I'm here today for a couple ofdifferent reasons uh one we are just shyof the one year mark of mandateofficially becoming part of Google Cloudwhich means we pretty firmly have ourfeet kind of on the ground we have anunderstanding of uh where we kind of sitacross Google security and really mostimportantlywe've gotten through the process of kindof widening our lens and understandingthis kind of broader perspective thatGoogle has always had twothe last 18 months in cyber security forthose of you who've been payingattentionreally have been probably the mostdramatic shifts uh that I certainly haveever seen in my career uh most peoplewho I've spoken to agree that we are ina dramatically different place than wewere about 18 months ago pretty muchacross the board which is uh interestingto seewhen I was kind of preparing for thispresentation I found a dozen reallydifferent metrics looking at kind of 100different aspects of really what boilsdown to the same thing which ismeasuring the use of cloud computing uhand cloud in general across pretty muchall Industries and it's they all prettymuch agree uh every industry out therecontinues to rise in their use of cyberCloud environments Cloud ecosystemsCloud resources and this rise in Cloudadoption really has been pretty greatfor most Industries there's been kind ofan overall drop in the price of storagethe cost of computing efforts uh all thedifferent resources that come along withCloud butthis widespread adoption of cloud reallyhas resulted in a much wider what wecall a tax surface for malicious actorsand so what we're seeing now is thiskind of broad increase in the number ofactors targeting Cloud environments andalmost more importantly an increase inthe reasons behind those attacks theactors that we track from all sorts ofdifferent motivations are regularlytargeting Cloud environments and they'redoing it in increasingly brilliant waysso what I'm here today to kind of talkaboutis who we see targeting Cloudenvironmentshow they're doing it and mostimportantly why that matters for thoseof you who are interested in Cloudsecuritywe're going to focus first and foremoston what we call Initial access ttps itmeans how they're getting in the veryfirst step in the attack chain thatattackers use when they're breaking intosome sort of cloud environments andwhile we're talking about this andreally throughout this wholepresentation I want you to keep onephrase in mindyou don't need to break in if you cansteal the keys this is really kind ofcentral to a lot of the tactics thetechniques the procedures that we'veseen from all of these different actorswho've been targeting Cloud for sometime so let's start with to me what iskind of the scariest realization inCloud Security today so depending on thesources you're using to gauge thismetric depending on who you ask andwhere you're looking about 60 to 70percent of the compromises that we seeas a security apparatusinside Cloud environments begins withcredential compromiseand when some of my colleagues firsttold me that my jaw kind of Hit theFloorbut really to understand why that's soshocking I want to put this intoperspective when I say 60 to 70 percentof compromises begin with stolencredentials what that means is fishingspear fishing vulnerabilities uh supplychain compromises any of the othertactics that actors use to break into acloud environmentcombined are less common in what we'reseeing than credential compromisewhythe simple fact is and I'm sureeverybody here knows this taking anentire organization any organization andconducting this kind of major move to acloud or a hybrid environment or evenusing Cloud resources in ways that youhaven't used them before is reallyreally difficult It's Tricky it'stechnically difficult it's a Personnelnightmare depending on your organizationin many cases from this kind of personalperspective it's never going to leaveanybody happy at the end of the daynobody's going to say wow I had a greatday today integrating into this newCloud environment butthe one thing that we continue to see isthe thing that makes it easier forpeople inside your organization yourengineers your sys admins your networkfolks your service folks or securityfolksthe thing that makes it easier for themto do their job well and do their jobhappily is breaking down who can dotheir job and who has access to whatdifferent parts of your organizationinside everything that you own based onidentity this isn't a secret identityaccess management is kind of the core ofbeginning cyber security inside a cloudenvironmentyour service accounts need to make surethat they can fix problems based oneverybody who's using Services yoursecurity folks want to go into any partof your organization whether it's cloudor hybrid or on-prem and they want tofind the bad stuff and fix it but thetruth is like I said the easiest way toactually get a cloud or hybridenvironment to work or even just not tobreak is to manage who can see what andto use their identity as a way tocontrol accessunfortunatelywe are not the only people who haverealized that malicious actors haverealized that as well and this isn'tjust useful for Good Guys what we'restarting to see is bad guys haverealized exactly how powerful credentialaccess has been to the point where weare starting to see some attacks whereactors are burning incredibly valuableand Powerful zero days just so they canensure that they can get access to acloud environment or other environmentand get access in a way that allows themto then steal credentials that means oneof the most powerful sophisticated toolsthat an actor can bring to an attack isbeing used in an end game really just tosteal credentialsthis isn't the only type of compromisethat we've seen though there are plentyof otherways that actors can go about conductinguh intrusions and even though there isan easy path comparatively when it comesto credentials that's not always thepath that we see these actors takevulnerabilities and specificallyvulnerabilities in the software orhardware systems that sit right at theperimeter of a networkare also extremely dangerous for actorswho are trying to compromise a cloudenvironment and in fact some of thecases of vulnerabilities inside Cloudenvironments can actually be much moredangerous than stolen credentials forThe Wider Community I want to talk aboutwhyeverybody in here is aware that you knowfor the past several months every timethere's a big zero day that comes outthere's a huge cycle but especially thisyear it might seem like you're hearingabout new zero days every other week andwe're going to dig into this a littlebit more uh in a bitbut if you go all the way back into thedistant past and think about some of theworst vulnerabilities that have hit logfor shell for instance I know many ofyou had a shiver of fear that went downthe back of your spine and hearing thosewords butthe reason that log for Shell wasn't sowasn't was particularly dangerous wasn'tbecause it was widespread or because itwas easy to execute the reason that itwas dangerous is because the ability toexecute log4 shell on a system that wasrunning log for Jaywas trivial and easily availableeverybody who wanted it had access tothat script and it made it very easy forthem to use itwhen we see vulnerabilities being usedat the pace at which they have been overthe past 18 months really and severalyears even further we start to see therisks really start to hit home when someof these vulnerabilities become publiclyavailablebut again cloud cloud vulnerabilitiesnot the only thing out there that'scausing a lot of troublemisconfiguration I'm not going to spendtoo much time on this everybody knowsit's difficult to get everything workingexactly as correctly as you need it tobebut one of the most dangerous thingsabout misconfiguration is that it allowscertain Acts or actorsopportunistic access on a one-off basisbased on mistakes made inside yourorganization or with the ways that youinteract with other organizations veryvery difficult to catch unless you knowexactly where to look and how toidentify some of these misconfigurationsbut again not the most common and thelast TTP that I want to talk about issupply chain compromise when it comes toSoftwarethis is a really fascinating example andagain one of the examples of initialaccess that is particularly dangerouswhen we talk about scale if you go backin time and think about one of the mostdangerous software supply chaincompromises that's happened in recentyears if you go back to the solar windsbreach one of the problems with solarwinds was that the initial access ofthose particular actors who we now knowto be apt-29were able to gain initial access toabout 18 000 victims at the end theyonly compromised about a handful of thembut the problem with software supplychain compromise is that it allowsactors to gain massive amounts of accessbased on one particular attack chain inthe hands of someone like a ransomwaregroup The solarwinds Campaign would havebeen devastating and would have resultedin a huge huge amount of compromisesthat would have potentially crippledsome serious Industriesthese are the kinds of threats thatwe're really really concerned about whenit comes to tracking what particularmethods these actors are going to use togain access to a cloud environment but Iwant to talk more specifically about whowe are worried aboutif you know anything about mandate youknow that cyber Espionage is one of ourbiggest concerns this is where we spenda lot of our time and effort in trackingstate-sponsored groups that areconducting cyber intrusionsthey are the most dangerous generallyand most sophisticated types of actorsthat we track so it's no surprise thatwe've seen the most dangerous andcreative methods used to compromiseCloud ecosystems come from exactly thesekinds of actorsand I want to reiterate that when we saycyber Espionage actors we're talkingabout actors sponsored by Nations toachieve a huge array of different goalsunderstanding how these actors are taskswhat their goals are and what they needto accomplish their mission really iscritical to understanding not just whythey might come after you but how andtherefore how to protect yourselfso let's start with the most dangerousgroup of cyber Espionage actorsFar and Away the number one spot ofcyber for cyber Espionage actors interms of danger and sophistication comesfrom Chinese sponsored groups this hugenumber of intrusions that we see eachyear especially in the last couple ofyears especially focusing on zero daysinvolved an actor tied probably in manycases to a Chinese Nexus EspionageoperationChinese Espionage campaigns have beenreally interesting for a long time butspecifically in the past couple of yearswe've started to seethe later stages of an evolutionin the distant past you would see PRCAffiliated activity focused on socialengineering and fishing now what we'reseeing is that they're focused onhitting what we call Edge infrastructurelike I said that stuff that sits rightbetween your network and the internetwe've also seen them improve a lot intheir obfuscation and their operationalsecurity they're focused very heavily ondeveloping infrastructure that allowsthem to conduct a lot of very dangerousattacksbut the past few years what's reallyreally shown in cyber Espionagecampaigns stemming from China is thatthey have been burning zero days at arate that is really truly staggeringso depending on the circles that you runin on Twitteryou might have seen the phrase hot zeroday summer prop up a couple of timesthat is a uh tongue-in-cheek phrase butwhat we're talking about is a very veryreal phenomenon this past summer hasbeen host to some of the most dangerousand worrying zero days that have come upin the past decadewe've seen a huge amount of effort by uhmostly Chinese sponsored groups to usethese zero days in a ways that areincredibly dangerousin the last two years the pace ofChinese zero-day exploitation hasaccelerated very very significantly alot of the evidence that we've seen ofChinese cyber Espionage actorsexploiting zero days uh was dramatic wesaw 11 different zero days beingexploited in 2021 and nine in 2022 thenumber is continuing to go up this yearof those zero days that we've seen thathave been targeted and used by ChineseNexus Ops have been focused on flaws invirtualization software networkingproducts and security devices likefirewalls vpns and email securityapplianceswhat is important about this is thatlike I said the problem with the zeroday isn't that it's used by one groupthe problem with the zero day is that ittargets a vulnerability that does notyet have a patch and in certaincircumstances if the code used to Targetthose zero days is released publiclythat is when we are really reallyconcerned about a growth in significantpace and severity of attacksthese zero days that we have seen comeout from uh chinese-sponsored Espionagegroups really isn't uh it's definitelynot accidental the capability to findand use these zero days certainly isn'tsomething that's happened by chance whatwe're seeing like I said is the resultof years and years and years of effortand investment by chinese-sponsoredgroups to build the capability to findand use these zero days in Rapidsuccessionthis is a huge infrastructure at workthat is focused almost entirely onfinding vulnerabilities and feeding themto some of their offensive cyberoperations and specifically thesevulnerabilities are being looked for inwhat we call Edge devices again thestuff that sits right at the edge ofyour network between your network andthe internet there's a couple of reasonswhy that's important but hiding in theedge primarily allows these actors to dosomething that other devices on yournetwork don't meaning that they areoutside the normal detection radius of alot of cyber security capabilities ifthey're hiding in something like arouter if they're hiding in somethinglike virtualization software thehypervisors that guide a lot ofdifferent VMS if they're hiding insomething like a firewallnone of these things fall within yournormal parameters for detectingmalicious activity and it allows them toset up this campaign and sit as close asthey can inside their uh targetedNetworkthe other thing we've seen in adevelopment from Chinese cyber Espionagecampaigns is this ability to stayinvasive out in the wild they've beenfocusing on building up this kind ofmassive iot botnet they're using many ofthese different botnets as smoke screensand they're using tunneling tools to tryand hide a lot of their activity makingit very very difficult to track some oftheir activity in the wild and moreimportantly very difficult to actuallydefend against that activity once itstarts hitting your networkthe other really surprising sponsor ofcyber Espionage that I think has posed asignificant threat over the past coupleof years is North Koreathey've really stepped up their game inthe past couple of years and you kind ofhave to hand it to them they are reallyreally dramatically more dangerous thanthey have been over the past severalyears what we've seen is that this Focushas come out of North Korea and cyberEspionage that really is still doing itsclassic North Korean intelligencemissions it's targeting defectors anyonealigned against them and thegeopolitical stage they're specificallyinterested in nuclear anything to dowith the Korean peninsulabut the real Innovation that's comingout of North Korea is focused onactually funding their ongoing cyberEspionage campaigns and they're turningto crypto to do it almost every dprkactor that we track is in some wayengaged in criminal activity and it'sreally focused very heavily like I saidon crypto most of it is coming out ofsome of their General reconnaissancebureausbut they really have also learned to dosome pretty significant and Innovativestuff one of the things that we'velearned is that when they conduct alarge-scale intrusion and steal asignificant amount of cryptothey can't then turn around and spendthat crypto immediately they have tolaunder it somehow The Innovation hereis really fascinating because whatthey've started doing is investing inthe means to mine more crypto which isin effect actually laundering theircryptocurrency they buy things likecomputing power or hash power they alsobuy a lot of the uh gpus that have beenon sale or server space anything likethat and use that to then mine newcrypto and use that scheme and thatoutput of that crypto to then fund theircontinued operations sometimes literallyto keep the lights on for their officeswhere they work to try and support theirEspionage campaigns fascinatingfascinating stuff coming out from NorthKorea in the past couple of years andvery very dangerous especially becausewe've seen them become very competentwhen it comes to software supply chaincompromiseNorth Korea in particular has becomevery very good at software as a servicetargeting they've been going after thiskind of targeted supply chain compromisewe wrote A Blog about this one inparticular but there's another one thathas also happened I think in the pastcouple ofseveral several months ago but theability to conduct these targeted supplychain compromise attacks is reallyreally fascinating and againa very dangerous capability for NorthKorea to be displaying in theiroperationsthe other major sponsors of cyberEspionage that we want to talk aboutbriefly are Russia first and foremostRussia is fascinating for a lot ofdifferent reasons but really in the past18 months they've undergone a veryfundamental shift in how and why they dobusiness and subsequently a shift in whois it going to be likely affected byRussian cyber espionagethe answer to all of those questions isone word it's Ukraine they're very veryinterested in what's going on insideUkraine any of the campaigns that we'veseen that have been focused outside ofUkraine have really focused very heavilyon diplomatic and geopolitical supportfor ongoing uh Ukrainian resistance tothis invasionalthough Russia's down it's very clearlynot out the Russian Gru the FSB so Apes28 29some of the other groups that we trackas Russian cyber Espionage campaignssandworm turla they're still out therethey're still very dangerous they stillhave their focus very intensely set onUkraine but whether that continues inthe future uh is fluid and we willcontinue to see how it develops movingforward based on the outcome of thisongoing invasionand then the last of what we call thebig four sponsors of cyber Espionage isIran this one luckily has been againvery geopolitically focused uh most ofthe Iranian special uh cyber Espionagethat we've seen has been focused veryheavily in their immediate regionthey're very concerned with uh the backand forth between Israel and Iran uhthere's been quite a bit of othertargeting coming out fromiranian-sponsored cyber Espionage butit's very difficult to kind of say withany certainty that they are determinedto move beyond their kind of immediateRegional Focusunfortunately we're not only concernedabout cyber Espionage when it comes tothreats to Cloud environments the bigconcern that we have and I thinkprobably the more immediate concern tomost organizations out there is probablycoming from cyber crime actorswhat's really been fascinating goingback to my original pointis that cyber crime actors especiallyyou've been tracking them for quite sometimetend to follow a very specific anddarwinian set of principlesthey're focused on making the maximumamount of money for the least amount ofeffort and the least amount of riskif you've been looking at threatactivity for a while you might besurprised to see here that a lot of thecyber crime actors that we've beentracking for a long time have kind ofreverted to form a lot of what they'vebeen doing lately has been focused veryspecifically on Stolen credentials as ameans to conduct intrusionswith a rise in ransomware activity thatwe saw several years ago really start tokick off that has shifted now intoprimarily an information theft gamewe started to see this kind of shiftyears ago in cyber criminal gangsforegoing targeting individual bankaccounts and monetary accounts or creditcards and really start to focus on masstargeting organizationswhat we're seeing coming out from cybercrime actors with this focus onconducting information theft and holdingorganizations for ransom is really theirlatest method in conducting what theirprime directive is which is findingprofit doing crimethe interesting thing about the pastcouple of years is that we've started tosee this really rapid disruption in theunderground economy in a lot more actorsreally starting to offer and look forstolen credentialsthe other thing that's happening is thatin Beyond just buying and selling stolencredentials they are buying and sellingthe means to Steel credentials if you'refamiliar with kind of the undergroundactors and their uh ecosystemyou know that most of what happens inthere has really become fragmented asactors have become more specialized alot of them have been very very focusedon building out these specific servicesthat are very professional very well runthat are focused on doing one particularthing some of them are initial accessBrokers some of them are specificallyransomware Brokers some of them areransomware developers a lot of whatwe've seen over the past couple of yearsis that more and more actors areexpanding this kind of UndergroundMarket into buying and selling not onlycredentials but the means to obtain thema lot of this actually comes up to uhwhat I like to think of as leadingindicators if we go back to the log forJay and the log for Shell incident someof the first people who really startedto sound alarm bells in that incidentweren't big security vendors it waspeople running individual Minecraftservers because thisexploit got leaked people were scanningfor anything running Java in avulnerable position and then all of asudden their servers started dyingbecause it was you know being hijackedby all these actors who were juststarting to do exactly this cryptojacking thing in my opinion cryptojacking probably is an indicator offurther compromise if somebody got inwith a crypto Jacker somebody's probablyelse has figured out how to get intoyour networkthese kinds of threats though as theydevelopareless of a concern I think than whatwe're seeing right now this focus oncredentials being used to Target cloudis not a coincidencemalicious actors understand that that isthe best way to go about not onlyintruding into a cloud environment butjust running a cloud environment ingeneralthere are a lot of risks that are facingeveryone involved with and who usesCloud on a daily basis and it's verymuch true that those risks areincreasing in number and sophisticationbut it's important for me to state thatthose risks aren't nebulous they aren'tsome kind of unknowable inevitabilitythe key to understanding those risks thekey to comp countering those risks isthe entire purpose of cyber intelligenceit's our job to track and find andquantify those risks and communicatethem to you so that you know what youcan do about it at the very onset of theuh the Russian invasion of UkraineSandra Joyce had a very very excellentpoint which is prepare don't panic andshe was talking specifically about theinvasion but that actually comes inhandy for anyone who is concerned aboutcyber security especially when it comesto Cloud there are a lot of unknowns outthere when it comes to Cloud there are alot of unknowns when it comes to cybercrime cyber Espionage all the differentmalicious actorscloud is an evolving space and thethreat actors are learning rightalongside the rest of usthey've come pretty much to the sameconclusion that we have that the bestway to understand any living given Cloudenvironment is to use identity accessand see who has access to your org andwhat they can do with itand like I said at the beginning thereason that we're seeing this focus oncredentials is because like I said it'seasier to steal the keys than it is tobreak inafter nearly a year of mandate workinginside and alongside Google I canconfidently say that mandian and GoogleCloud are laser focused on doing ourabsolute best to help in whatever way wecan there's nobody out there who has asilver bullet there's no magic beanthat's going to make you unable to becompromisedthe best thing that you can do is justyour best and our job is to make surethat you are as prepared as you possiblycan be to achieve thatI think that's all we have time for sothank you very much appreciate it andwe'll uh talk to you again next year"
