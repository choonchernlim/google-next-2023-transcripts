noticeda broom closet next to the barhe was struck with an ideahe decided to break down that closetthrow in an investment of sixteenhundred dollars and install a pizza ovenhe started serving fresh handmade pizzasto the patrons that broom closet thatTavern was the very first Papa John'sthat young man was John Snyder thefounder of Papa Johnon with the passion for Qualityingredients and a secret family recipefor the pizza sauce he started you knowserving delicious pizzas to the patronsand turned the business around fastforward 40 years today in this digitalage we're here to tell you howtechnology enables better ingredientsbetter pizza at Papa John's so my nameis Anup Anup Prasad and I lead theconsumer business at cognizantcognizant is a large I.T ServicesCompany they're priced at the Confluenceof industry and Technology we drivetransformation for Global 2000 clientsone of the segments we drive deeptransformation in is the food industryand the reason we need to continue doingthat is because of all of you theconsumers the expectations of consumerswhen it comes to the experience theyexpect from the qsrs from therestaurants keep going up every yearyou would pick up your phone on a Fridayevening go to a mobile app and place anorder for pizza select all of thetoppings throw in some jalapeno if youlike me and you would expect your pizzato be delivered at your doorstep in 42and a half minutesthe online Commerce volume in thissegment has ballooned over the last fewyears it's expected to be 170 billiondollars by end of this yearyou would walk up to a kiosk at anairport or a restroom pick up your BigMacfries and a drink and you'd expect theorder to be ready with minimal humaninteractionWendy's is trying to solve thedrive-through problem working withGoogle and leveraging Google's Ai andgen AI you have seen installer theresolving drive through and automatingthat experienceis the Holy Grail in 2sr especially withwhat has happened since the pandemicwhere a lot of demand has shifted todrive through and the digital channelsand if you watched Elon Musk live streamthe Model SSD version 12 over the weekend you wouldknow that autonomous vehicles andself-driving cars is going to be realityvery soon and that's going to transformThe Last Mile experience for theconsumers and it's going to haveimplications for the restaurants andqsrs as wellto deliver that customer experience andDelight the consumers on a day in andday out basis a well-oiled restaurantneeds to have a very well integratedfront of house and back of housetechnology and operationsso a customer can interact across any ofthe channels whether it's the WebChannelthe mobile appcontact center or directly at the storeand the order needs to seamlessly flowto the heart of the restaurantoperations which is the kitchenand there's normally a lot happeningaround the kitchen you've got the smartkitchen software menu managementInventory management labor schedulingfor the employee experience and then theintegration in the back room with theonline aggregator apps and the driverapps for all of this to come together ina seamless integrated fashion you neednew real-time communication and the datafabricand when we are able to do this for ourrestaurant clients for clients like PapaJohn's we are able to create meaningfulbusiness valuewe're able to impact key businessmetrics and it is not only aboutenhancing customer experience reducingcard abandonment rate or reducing ordercancellation improving the look to bookRatio or reducing your overall cap yourcustomer acquisition cost it is alsoabout driving operational efficiencyand in this business it's always adelicate this between pushing theenvelope for customer experience whileat the same time managing your costsso reducing your food wastage reducingdelivery costs optimizing Drive timesare some of the important imperatives ina restaurant context in factif you look at the customer complaintstwo of the areas you receive the mostcomplaints about is the wait times andthe Order of accuracy and I'm sure manyof you have experienced that over timeas wellso when we are able to drive a front ofhouse and back of house transformationin the orchestration I talked about weare able to create meaningful resultsand outcome in a story like Papa John'sso we've been working with Papa John'sfor quite some time we've driventransformation across the store channelthe point of sales helping create theproduct Master delivery transformationin in fact created a new channel calledthe papa call so if you called your PapaJones neighborhood store a few yearsback on a Super Bowl Sunday more thanlikely your call may not get answeredbecause the store associates were busyserving the patrons inside the store orhandling the volume of the orderrealizing the opportunity to capturethat lost sales we actually built thetechnology platform to centralize all ofthe calls across the 2000 store Networkin Papa John's drive better customerexperience Drive agent experience infact increase Revenue per order andreally create a new Revenue channel forthe business which was in fact talkedabout by the Papa John CEO in one of theearnings release so we've driventransformation across channels from astore from a contact center perspectiveand the last piece of thattransformation which we recently workedwith Papa John's on is the e-commercemodernization on Google Cloud whichyou'll hear a lot aboutand let me invitemy client here just such before I dothat here's a quick backstory so yes weand I have work together known eachother for 10 plus years and our journeystarted in a retail contextand as we were reflecting on thatjourney and this session one of thethings he he mentioned which was veryintriguing and struck home for me is youknow you place an order in a retailcontext on an e-commerce Channel and youexpect your product and shipment toarrive in a couple of days maybe longerif you pay more next day or same daydeliverywhen you place an order in e-commercecontext in Papa John's you expect yourpizza with all of the right toppingsto arrive at your doorstep in 42 and ahalf minutes not 65 not 25 because bothof those would be considered failedcustomer experience so you have a verynarrow window around that expecteddelivery time where customer Delighthappensand to actually deliver that it almostrequires Perfection from a technologyand operations perspectiveso with that let me invite discuss willyou talk about how technology deliversthat Perfection and delivers thatcustomer Delight in Papa John'sthank you enough uh good to see all ofyou today one thing if there's one thingI would like to for all of you to takeaway is I appreciate the one that pizzadelivery driver comes to your door andyou eat that pizza I want you to have anew level of appreciation and understandwhat it takes to actually do that Anupcovered a little bit of that but it's afascinating business it's a lot of funone of our purposes of our company isthe world deserves a better pizza and wedeliver it so that's that's our purposeand in this journey we'll show you howtechnology plays a big role in actuallyfacilitating thatso just a little bit about the companywe are in excluding North America we'rein 47 countries and it and the listkeeps growing uh in in moreInternational countries just in Canadaand USA we have like 3 200 restaurantsum 75 percent of our business has movedinto digital in just in the last fewyears and I'll talk about what does itmean it's not just the website and appsthere's a lot more to itthe other interesting facts are we havelaunched a whole new set of new productssince2000 2000 uh you know 2020 we launched alot of new products and some of you mayhave tasted thoseum so it to bring that all theseproducts to life digitally uh it's it'san interesting problem to solve and uhwe'll get into thatso you know we um it like kind ofmentioned you know we built a lot of oursoftware ourselves it's you knowinternal but over the years we realizedthat there are some challenges that wewant to overcome to to grow the businesseven more and one of them is uh in agreater site stability and customersatisfaction one of the most interestingthings is the traffic pattern is uh verypredictable Friday nights are thebusiest nights now for all the nightsFriday you know it used to be that uhSuper Bowl day or a Valentine's Day usedto be the highest traffic but now everyFriday is like that uh so we have youknow exceeded certain uh trafficexpectations and now we have to haveeven more robust uh customersatisfaction by the basics of having uhproper stabilitylimitations and on personalization so wewanted to do more and morepersonalization especially as ourloyalty customers are growing we haveover 30 million uh loyalty customers sohow do you personalize even more for forall of themand uh we said in 2020 coming into 2020we said food is the star so meaningcreate new uh Innovations and inventionsin the food sector so for example welearned something called papadia whichis a handheld some of you may havetasted it this April we launchedsomething called Doritos Cool Ranchpapadia it's a partnership with Pepsiwhere we use the Doritos product butalso our own pizza so a pizza product sothat's a lot of new products that welaunched so to increase the velocity anddigitally bring everything together it'snot just the kitchen but also launchingnew products so that's the challenge ofmany Innovation and faster front-endwebsite performance was another need wehad and then innovating to open up theecosystem to innovate more with ML andAI so we had to build that foundationand some of the other technologychallenges are we wanted more AutoscalingSimplicity of middleware where we canyou know increase the number ofreal-time messages you know I don'tmentioned a little bit of how uh thefrom the time the order happens tofulfilling of the order it's a verylimited time there's a lot of real-timeevents so having the right platform toyou know accommodate that and thencontentwego we actually launched video as well onour appif you and our websites are really freshvideos which highlight the betteringredients better Pizza messaging andhow it comes to life in a on our properdigital properties in a great videosoftware product and so how do you youknow enable this uh new assets to beserved up with speed and with consistentuser experience and then finally theability to monitor so as we went intothis much broaderservices-based architecture how do youmonitor that and alerting and abilityfor the right groups to take actionsthat was a big need as well so you knowfrom a vendor standpoint we we have amixed environment but for thisparticular project we worked withcognizant because of their deepexpertise with our ecosystem as undermentioned they've been with us for 11years and they helped us build a lot ofdifferent systems so they're perfect forthis projectum we haveuh I mean cognizant has deep expertisein the restaurant uh industry uh there'sa they have a great software practice interms of capabilities and how they canpartner with us understand ourrequirements and you know scalesomething and build proof of Conceptsquicklyum and in using ML and AI one simple usecase was how do you set the expectationlike think about it in a dynamicenvironment where there's labor in acapacity there's the oven capacityitself on how many pages can be made sohow do you tell the customer like whattime they can expect that pizza sothat's a interesting problem to solveand cognizant has worked with us tosolve problems like thatand then they took a dearest approach soyou know we can't eat the the whole piein one shot so how do you go in slicesso basically doing the appropriateassessment you know giving the properrecommendations and you knowrevalidating you know Google as theplatform we started the Googlerelationship five years ago but when itcame to this you know e-commercemodernization you know they kind ofrevalidated that with their expertise sothat was then it became the go-toplatformuh and then also how do you scale withinthe Google Cloud itself you knowrecommending additional Solutions andhelping us you know leverage the fullecosystem of Google Cloudum and then bringing in some vertex Aiand some other Cutting Edge Technologiesas wellthat were important to us wereresiliency and speed to Market you knowI talked about you know the ability tolaunch new products we also have anationalspecials or offers we have localspecials that offers it's an interestingbusiness where the franchisees cancreate their own local specials so in anenvironment like that how can you youknow facilitate speed to Marketnot only the products but the relatedoffers and driving repeat business andincreased engagement creating thatdifferentiated experience for thecustomers so the you know for differentsegmentsby creating different offerings in theirloyalty segment and then increasing theconversion so we enjoy a pretty highconversion compared to a typicalretailer because if somebody is comingto our properties they do have theintent to to eat something so we justhave to you know tailor that better someelements where you know decoupledmicroservices Cloud native designhighly available Services a service meshandautomated deployments was a big thingfor us andwe emphasized that as a tenant so from asolution approach you know we we saw thechallenges or the problem statementsearlier some of the approaches that wetook were you know building out thecloud native services using headless youknow front-endmicro front ends leveraging Google Pubsub quite heavily for all our real-timeEventingand business driven Flows In CMS sowe've empowered the content managementteams to to be able to create theirdifferent assets and publish uh you knowfastand then the automated pipeline CI CDpipelines leveraging you know all thedifferent checks all the way from unittests to you know evenlet's call it the accessibility testingas welland then finally machine learning andvertex AI we started solving it with thetheETA setting but also we're doing someautomated dispatching and solving otherinteresting problems with the vertex AIum the this is a future Statearchitectureum how the Upstream systems everythinghas to be Papa so Papa track is a systemthat you can track you know once youactually place the order how the ordergets to you uh very similar to you knowthe driver approaching your homeexperienceum you know some of the other systemsthat were mentioned earlier uh mappingplays a big role whether it's customercoming to the store carry out or takeout solution or if it's a delivery sothere's a whole B to b2c platform butalso the aggregators and papa call justto touch on Papa call this is a IDF acentralized call center and thecognizant team helped helped us withthat before that individual stores wouldhave to take the phone calls so imaginethe store is already busy you knowtrying to put out as many orders as theycan but then on top of that they have totake the phone calls of the customerswhich you know depending on the customerit can take a long time so one of theuh big benefits we got with Papa callwas you know centralizing the calls to acentral call center which uses the sameplatform as all the back-end systemsthat that are used for the website orfor the ads and so it's a commone-commerce platform that serves uh Papacall and now you know we're working oneven taking that even further with voiceAi and other Technologiesthe other aspect is aggregator so thethe philosophy is meet the customerwhere they are so whatever thechannel of preference you know ifsomebody wants to order through ubereatswe are there if somebody wants to overorder through GrubHub we are there aswell so we want to make ourselvesavailable in all of these channels andwith a common e-commerce front and sothat's been the journey that you knowthe team has been helping us thenthere's a lot of subsystems the theMarketing Systems the the store systemas well which is our own sort ofproprietary systemum and then the different gateways sojust to give you an ideasome of the key benefits that we got outof this was you know highly scalablearchitecture that is resilient into thefuture you know we are able to do uh ina faster app development and deploymentwith the with this Foundation uh we weabsolutely got higher availabilitysystem availabilityand then separating the front end youknow the angular front ends into microfront ends has been a big benefit aswelland then it's ultimately adding agilityfor us you know how our businesspartners can think of ideas and they cancome to life fasterand then containerize the deploymentarchitecturefrom a technical benefit standpointresiliency at every level whether it's abackend or network or UI level we'reable to achieve that encryption at restand and then in the transport layer andthen Auto scaling you knowAuto scaling by different means whetherit's a CPU or memory or threats or otherways it's been a huge help in terms ofaccommodating this bursts of traffic wewe do get Bursa traffic it's not atypical retailer where maybe BlackFriday is busy or some other we we getif day to day or week to week we can getbursts of trafficand then the ability to do blue GreenerCanary deployment sothose are some benefits we gain and wecontinue to gain so in terms of the roadmap you know we are working on greateramounts of personalization whether it'suh loyalty customers or guest customersthat we don't know so much about how canwe do greater personalization uh Imentioned voice AI earlier you knowthat's actively being worked onand then you know we want to have thisflexibility to integrate with any thirdparty whether it's aggregators or anyother technology or solution justbecause we want to be in all placesum you know we want to have the ease ofintegrationthen and also we want to leverage automlbqml and vertex AI specifically thosethree tools within the Google Cloud moreand we're looking forward to someadditional partnership with cognizant onon that front and then definitely gen AIwhether it's content creation especiallyin content creation and and other youknow enhancing of the product you knowdigitally sothose were theyou know the next roadmap items thatwe're working on so with that I think wecan open up for okay uh some questionsthank you a fascinating story before weopen it up for the audience to askquestionsum I was wondering so when I used tocall my neighborhood Papa John's storethey would know what sort of pizzasthey've ordered in the past the toppingsI likeum so how do you how do you intend tosort of Drive recommendations on theCommerce platform if I go online uhwould the engine tell me like I'mmissing the banana peppers from mytoppings because I'm sure there's a lotof margin you make on toppings right yesthat's a great great observation youknow that is that is where the you knowyou can increase the ticket you knowdefinitely increasing the ticket sizesuh goal if you notice in our website orin our apps you know we we already haveproduct level recommendations that weimplemented a couple years ago we alsohave this upselling capability wherewhether it's toppings or even differenttypes of sauces that we have whetherit's like chicken wings or other typesof products we can upsell but whatunhappy's touching is on it's even ahigher level of recommendation where youget into the ingredient level or tappinglevel recommendation so we are currentlythinking about this and it's ait's a you know interesting problem tosolve which will directly have Revenuebenefits for us soum you know the we are working oncreating what is the right way to solvethat problem without being toodisruptive in the customer Journey youknow you don't want to like turn themoff but at the same time in a verysubtle and in context manner how do yourecommend the right topic so that is onthe roadmapforeign"
