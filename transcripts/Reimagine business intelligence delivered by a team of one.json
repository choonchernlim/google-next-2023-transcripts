your day talking about dataanalytics in bi there's nothing I'drather be doing at the end of my daytodayum and before we get to our incredibleset of panelists today and sort ofintroduce each of themthe thing that that strikes me aboutthis roomand and sort of if yeah if you lookaround at this room this is a room fullof the people who have the answersif you think about your role in thecompany and just show of hands here howmany people are sort of considered to bethe data person in their company show meyour handsall right wow that's almost everybody inhereokay so another another questionhow many of you feel likeyou're the only data person in thecompanyokayI worked at a startup like 180 years agoand so I know what that feels like I'mvery oldum I know what that feels like I knowwhat it feels like to sort of be theperson with the answers that's a reallyhard role to be in it's a reallyimportant role to be in I think thething that we're going to talk abouttodayis sort of a transformation that hasbeen happening and this transformationfrom being the people with the answersto the people who are the enablersright and so with that I'd encourage youas we sort of get to the end of thislike ask your questions we haveincredibly talented data analyticsleaders here and and would really askyou to come grab the mic at the end ofthis session and ask your questions sowe can really make this conversationalokay so with that we are trying toadvance my slides hereall right perfectso with that I want to introduce ouramazing panelnumber one is Amy Yuri stickler who isthe director of global strategicinitiatives for Google Cloudnext to her is Sharon Prosser who is thevice president of SMB sales and skilledacquisition for Google cloud and lastbut not least is Yasmine Ahmad who isthe managing director for productactivation data analytics and GoogleCloud I'm Bryson Gordon and I am thesenior director of growth marketing andskilled marketing at Google cloud andjust thrilled to be here with all of youso with that let's let's jump in and I'mgoing to start with Amy Amy has been atGoogle for over 20 yearsand so Amy as being the most tenuredperson at Google on this panel wouldlove to get your perspective on how haveyou seen data analytics bi transformingover your career here at Googleit's Brysonum and good to see you all uhI think you know how many of you in theaudience are AdWords or Google ads usersanyoneokay we have some so you know when Istarted at Google we obviously were atthat point just a search companyum but even back then you know whatpeople would come to ask us about wasyou know help me understand what peopleare searching for andyou know through the evolution ofobviously us becoming a much largercompanyum and the growth of Google Cloud thequestion Still Remains which has helpedme understand how to leverage the datathat you have and to create insightswith thatso I would say if you look at how boththe smallest organizations and thelargest organizationsum the ones that are successful are theones that think abouthow do you turn data into insights andthen how do you democratize that datawithin the organization whatever size ofthe organization that you may havewe worked with I've worked with thelargest companies that Google works withon the advertising space and we followedthe same kind of principle that Googlehad in terms of creating successfulproducts which is how do I create a toolthat passes the toothbrush toothbrushtestwhich means if I don't create somethingthat people within my organization aregoing to use hopefully at least twice aday it's not going to be something thatactually is useful and or that actuallychanges behavior and so I would say as Ithink about data intelligence andbusiness intelligence for this group isyou know your job is going to changefrom being the source of information tosomebody that can actually createinsights for others through datadashboards and through teaching yourorganization how to how to truly findand access datain this new world how to teach them howto use generative AI to even ask dataintelligent questions that get answersand then ultimately to be to be not theperson but the source that creates thattoothbrush tool hopefully that actuallycreates that organizational changeI love that I also feel like note fornext year at next we should havetoothbrush swags to to hand out to allof our data folks yes I mean I'd love toget your perspective on the similarthing in terms of where do you see thetrajectory of business intelligenceheadingthanks Bryson so II'm super excited to beto be completely disrupted withgenerative Ai and everything that we'reseeing in the AI spaceand why do I say that well when I take astep back and look at businessintelligence and how it's done todaywe've had this promise of datademocratization forever everybody'sspoken about data democratization wewant everybody in the business to haveaccess to data and insights at theirfingertips but the reality of when Ispeak to customers of what's actuallyhappening is you have a centralized teamor you have somebody who is the dataperson in the organization and you haveto go to that person who's got access tothe data who understands how to connecttables together and pull out a report orcreate a dashboardand ultimately if you have to go throughthat process every time you want aninsightyou stop asking questions you stop doingthat speed of thought analysis of ohwhat's happening with my sales oh ifit's linked to this region can I look atit by country or can I look at it bydemographicyou only ask very pre-plannedpre-scripted questions you get yourfixed dashboard and that's already ahuge effort and you prevent yourbusiness from really being able toleverage data ask different questionsreally drill down for insights andultimatelyafter getting those dashboards orreports what do we all dowe open up slides and we start creatingthe presentation that you have todeliver at that MBR or that qbr or thatnext meeting so so this entire journeyof getting from data to really actionwhich is what we all want to do we wantto take action Based on data today itjust takes far too long way too complexand ultimately it hinders us from usingdata and sothe way I look at it is today we'retaking humans and expecting them tolearn technology and learn how to useuis and code and and dashboards andreports versus actually getting thetechnology to understand the human andso with generative AI in large languagemodels we have an opportunity to get thetechnology now to really speak thelanguage of humansspeak natural language and I think thatopens many many doors for us so I I lovethis one of the ways you know in some ofthe the data NBI teams that I've I'vemanaged we we used to talk a lot aboutdoes our data strategy have tunnelvisionright which is a very linear approach toI'm asking a specific question I'mgetting a specific answer but it tendsto miss everything that's around it andand sort of that context and what's inthat periphery I think is where a lot ofthe most interesting insights in abusiness can come from and so Sharonturning turning to you you work withcustomers every single daywhen you when you think about customerswho you talk to who you work with whoare sort of winning at their at sort ofimplementing their data strategy whatare some of the patterns that emergethere yeah andand you have a lot of customerinteraction and the what the customersare are looking for aresomewhatum I would say easy you know answers toquestions such asuh what is my customer acquisition costwhat are my churn signals uh what is thelifetime value of of my customers uh isthat customer moving through the thejourney that I've laid out in in such awayum that you know has positive outcomesuh and a lot of things are on customeranalytics that's a reallyum you know popular theme that we talkwith customers about it's it you knowseems to be a blind spot that they'relooking at unlocking same with uh youknow product in the product area youknow product adoption what's my productusage like so that that information canbe actioned by feeding it back intodevelopment soum really it's looking at where thoseblind spots are I um and it's a lotaround customer analytics productanalyticswebsite analytics so that that's one onekey win the second isaccess to helpful and useful datauh which means raining in thatproliferation of dashboards that existum you know if you've got 10 to 20different data sources and each of themhave a dashboardum it's the you know it's the standardmeeting you spend 20 minutes debatingwhose report is most accurate and whosedata isum you know should we run the meetingagainst and and then you've got verylittle time to actually uh you know takethe insights and build an action plan soum those are two wins that thatcustomers are looking for as they gothrough their their data journey I Ilove this this last point and I think alot of people in the room have had theexperience of coming to a meeting andtrying to decide whose data is rightum it's it's interesting it's sort ofwhere that works well in my experiencehas been where you actually invest thetime at the beginning in establishing aCommon Language of the businessthere is a common there is a unifiedlanguage of the business where everyterm is defined by specific data thatavoids all those problems uh when wetalk about LTV how are we defining LTVright when we're talking about churn howwe defining churn right or whatever itis it's sort of investing in almost likethat data dictionary that helps toscript a common language for everyoneacross a variety of roles I think is oneof the most foundational Investmentsthat that you know folks like the thefolks we have in this room can make butso let me let me throw back you know toyou Sharon then I'd open this up toeveryoneit's great like the wins are greatbut let's talk about the losses andlet's talk about sort of the mistakesthe pitfalls especially the things thatthat are avoidable what what has beensome of your experience with withcustomers thereyou know uh the first thought that comesto my mind is data readinessand again I mentioned if you've got youknow your data in 10 to 20 differentsources or or more uh you know you'regonna you're gonna be challenged withget with getting the full value out of abi solution uh and there's really noshortcut around getting your datacleaned upestablishing key business metrics youknow that the organization is signed offon that you will operate against and ifyou try and shortcut that piece uh itit's going to come back to to haunt youin so many waysespecially as your business grows andscalesI think the second mistake that I see iscustomers making what I would call ashort-term decision uh you know therethere are a lot of BI Solutions in themarket let's be frank uh and if you picka solution that you know does the quickand dirty you know right then and thereand uh you know you're probably going tobe back in the market looking as yourbusiness grows and so you know I I turnto the the RBI solution and we've put alot of thought into the portfolio and ifyou are a one to twosmall team of data personnelyou know think of the looker Studiothat's that's one offering in ourportfolio and you can get dashboards upin minutes it's freeand and then as you need more Enterprisefeatures built into your your operationyou upgrade to looker Studio Pro and youget a little bit more admin controlaround the environment and then whenyou're ready to go to an end-to-end bisolutionuh you can advance to the lookerplatform and there you've got access todata governance the ability to takeaction on on the data in the platformand so many other Enterprise gradefeatures and it's that ability to youknow for us to meet you where you areand and grow with youum and I'll share just a quick examplewith a customerthey were a startup looking to unlockthe music distribution business foremerging artists and they came to usthey had a they had a one-person datateam and they started on that lookerJourney with us and they now servethousands of users they're in 45 marketsand they haven't had to grow their datateam you know that much and so that thatyou know decision to to to go with thethe looker bioffering has served them well over theirJourneyas you were talking it reminded me of acustomer I spoke to multinationalfinancial institute and they actuallytold me they'd ended up with 16 000dashboards and you kind of Wonder do wereally need 16 000 dashboards is therethat many combination of metrics anddimensions to showand ultimately I think talking to to thepoints that you made there Sharon if youdon't look at your data Foundation tobegin with it's really easy for manydashboards to just proliferate acrossthe organization and I hear time andtime again from different organizationsthat they have all of these dashboardsmight be 16 000 of them yet they don'thave any data or Insight because they gofrom One dashboard to the next and themetrics don't match the customerlifetime value the the sales revenuenumbers don't match and so this is whyfrom a product perspective me being inthe product team we're we're reallyfocused on this problem of trusted andgoverned data and metrics for businessintelligence becausenone of those dashboards are useful youmight as well only have five dashboardsif you can truly trust in governmentfeel like you can trust the data andit's governed versus sixteen thousandacross the the organization and a recentcustomerum a lucrative customer of ours Jimshark they essentially came and engagedus purely because of that reason theyhad so many silos of data they had lotsof reports but just couldn't get trustedmetrics and so coming in theconversations that they had with us andthe data strategy that they built it wasall about that trusted governed datafoundation on which they could reallyget true insightsI love that soAmy I'm gonna I'm gonna come to you in aminute I Ilove the discussion of dashboards withinthe context ofsort of data life beyond the dashboardanda lot of what sort of our roles arewithin organizations is people talkabout how do you establish data culturehow do you start to build data culturenot just within a data team but acrossthe entirety of an organization and soAmy I I'd love your perspective onhow do you think about best practicesand I'd love everyone's perspective onthis especially because you you work onsuch different teams but starting withAmy how do you think about building dataculture across an organization and towhat extent is Gen AI going to catalyzea fundamental acceleration of thatso again I've had the pleasure ofworking with companies that are bothsmall and largeum and I think cultural change andestablishing cultural norms you have tohave the c-suite buy-inum and so I would say you know notthinking of data or businessintelligence just as a back officefunction as a first thing and reallymaking sure that between whateverc-suite that sits within your companythat you are establishing those kind ofhere's how we're defining the datahere's how we're going to talk aboutdata within the organizationum and then like anything most of youprobably have seen if you can get your Clike what's the CEO care aboutum and then oftentimes uh you know wehave really focused in on okay let'screate that view that the CEO caresabout because if he starts or she startscaring then we can get kind of thedownstream functions to start askingbetter questions that then will createthat organizational changeum so I would say if you haven't alreadyestablished you know a Common Languageamongst the executive teamhave a if you don't know what your CEOreally cares about in the data Journeyit's a good time to open thatconversation and then you know lastlyyou knowumto your question on how gen AI is goingto change that I think then I thinkthere's a lot of people that just don'treally understand still like okay howhow can gen AI help my organization so Ithink if you can actually what we'refinding in theorganizations we're working with is likeyou know very simple uh pocs thatbasically demonstrate some of them youknow you may have seen today in some ofthe sessions or whatnot but justdemonstrate how gen AI can helpbasically answer questions faster thanhumans can and in much more succinctways the summarizationsas an example I think you'll then startgetting the executive team to understandoh wow this is super powerful this ishelping me get insights for things thatI care about right so what is it thatthey care about and then fundamentallyyou know you'll start kind of gettinghopefully the support you need to investin generative AI even more so if youhaven't alreadyover to you guys I'll just add and we'llwe'll come to culture more it's umI I ran a large data analytics teamduring the presidential election in 2020and we were in absolute dashboard hellthat was dashboard after dashboard afterdashboard the candidate wants to seethis the candidate wants to see that andit was I mean thank God looker studiois so fast and so agile at creatingdashboardsbut if if everyone didn't see the demothis morning of duet AI working withbigquery and looker go watch it it'sphenomenal it's the type of thing thatit's it's going to change the way thatwe think about answering these types ofquestions where you can now just askthat question and instead of going andbuilding you know a half dozendashboards to try and find the Insightit's going to be able to extract thatand that's for me one of the reallyinteresting aspects of data culture thatI think is going to shift but Sharon Iget to sit in your rev callsum you know every every other week andand I know you are just a master atrunning data culture in yourorganization would love your perspectiveon how you've built that out yeah I youknow I I'm a sales leader so of coursethe numbers are important and theaccuracy of those numbers are alsoreally critical and we spend a lot oftime in the organization looking at whatare the channels that are feedingum you know those pipeline numbers uhand I do that in partnership withmarketing and I can't show up to aconversation with a set of data thatwe're not already in agreement with thatfrankly our teams aren't already lookingat and andum building a hypothesis around or wewould have that ubiquitous meeting ofhey let's talk about the data for 20minutes and then we'll talk about therevenue so you know it's got to be atthe core of how we do business and youknow and that's just in order to drivegreat Partnerships across theorganization but again back to you knowthat that sales leadership role it youknow it's important all the way down tothe individual contributor that theyunderstand you know how they'reperforming against you know theirtargets and that data has to be accurateso you know data is at the core of whatwe do just by nature of of the functionum you know from a gen AI standpoint Ithink it it unlocks the ability for usto do a lot of uh scenario planning andasking those what-if questions as welook to make investments orum you know uh maybe pull back in someareas so I I think it's it's going tohelp get away from the you know sort ofthe prescribed questions and and let usthink more creatively about how we go tomarket so and Yasmine coming coming toyou to close this out before we go toquestionsbringing it right back to the beginninga team of one right the people who sortof have the answers who a lot of that ison their shoulders what advice would youhave for them in terms of building dataculture and enabling gen AI to helpdrive a transformationyeah so I hope everybody got a chance tosee the keynote this morning where wedemoed the the new conversational UIexperience for Lucaum you saw in that demo basicallyit could be a business person chattingwith their business data so what we'redoing is we're taking large languagemodels Imagine The Bard and putting iton top of actually your structured andunstructured Enterprise business datayour sales data your Revenue data yourcustomer 360 data and enabling you toask questions of your data and in thatdemo you saw it doesn't just come backwith insights it comes back with chartsand graphs that back up that insight andshow where where that Insight came fromand so very much we see the the futureof bi trending in that space of becomingmuch more natural languageconversational UI based but to elaborateon that demoit's not just a one-way questionwhat we see with large language modelsand this multi-chat interface is itremembers the question that you asked 10seconds before an hour before or even aweek before so it becomes a conversationbecause the system knows the types ofquestions that you're asking at monthend quarter end so it's stateful itunderstands context and it can help toget you to the right answers based onthe context you're looking forand finallyyou know rather than have the the humanuser again take that insight and nowcreate the slides what you saw in thedemo this morning was you click thebutton for slide generation and itactually creates the slides with thecharts with the summaries for you so wesee the future of bi not being actuallyreports and dashboards because reportsand dashboards were about you as a dataperson having to go to a tool that had apredefined dashboard to pull some dataor have to create a dashboard which waslabor intensivewe see the future of bi being bi showingup where you are it's it's completelyassistive to the human so if you're on amobile device it should be there ifyou're in sheets it should be there ifyou're in slides it should be where youare working you should not have to comeout of your workflow come out of yourbusiness to go access data and a perfectum example of a customer who's beenworking with us on this is carbon Healththey wanted to get data out into theirclinics and so their clinicians actuallyuse connect to cheap sorry sheets todayand so they used are connected sheets umplug-in to actually serve reports andmetrics to the users where they'reworking and then they took it a stepfurther with the Google suite and theyactually turned those into PDF reportsthat are emailed because the first thingthe clinician comes and does in themorning is open their email and checkand so that's where they are so we wantthe data and insights to show up wherethe business user is at the time theyneed it if it's 4 am in the morning andyou're an executive or it's the weekendit's where you need it when you need itand in the format you need it so that'svery much where we CBI going today andto get to that journey of really havinglarge language models be able to do thatand for for your business is back towhat Sharon was talking about gettingthe foundationin the right order so that you do havethat structured unstructured data on topof which we can layer these these llmsand soum in an earlier session I'm going tosteal from that session it was mentionedthat every AI problem is actually a dataproblem in Disguise and I truly believethat the large language models have madeAI accessible and democratized toeverybody but now it comes back to thedatalove thatforeign"
