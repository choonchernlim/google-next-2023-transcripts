nightthank you so much we're humbled you'rehere and let's get it goingum to kick us off my name is Rohan I'm apartner at Deloitte and I want tointroduce Michael panelists go ahead higood morning everyone Jim Buntrock fromthe Mayo Clinic I'm a vice chair in anarea that supports Enterprise technologyServices I serve two main remits one isour Enterprise platforms around data AIidentity management and access andcontent delivered including our digitalexperience platform we also support alot of our patient-facing orconsumer-facing applicationshi everyone Kalyan from Marty I'm one ofthe product leads in Cloud AI I focus onEnterprise searchall right well you guys can have a seatand uh you know we're going to talktoday about Enterprise searchspecifically about how generative AI ischanging it but more importantly what'scoming after that as wella quick note they will have uh we'llhave space or some questions at the endso as you're listening to us if thereare things that are coming up pleasekeep those questions we'd love to hearfrom youall rightso with thatlet's talk a little bit today aboutinformation Discovery right we all knowthat Enterprise search has been a marketthat's been around for a long time 20years or so but information Discovery isstill unsolved we've talked to a lot ofcustomers and they're telling us thattheir data is growing exponentiallyboth volume and Variety in fact 45percent of all of all employees findthat their searches uh actually givethem like irrelevant resultsthey're also connected to more cloudsthan ever before more devices they'reaccessing more apps in fact 89 ofemployees actually have to search acrosssix sources before they can find theinformation they needmoreover with the pandemic we'reactually noticing that remote and hybridwork is further making this complex infact almost everyone say they cannotfind the information they need orthey're they're significantly impeded ingetting thereultimately people are looking for thatGoogle search like experience they'reused to it on the consumer side theywant it on the Enterprise sideand that's going to enable the real-timeand agile decision making that all of usare pressured to do in our workplacesso why is this a challenge and what'swhat's happening as a result of itwell for one we're noticing that peopleare wasting time looking for informationproductivity is actually getting youknow impacted significantly looking forinformation as you're having to swivelchair across multiple data sources thisproblem only compoundsit also adds to cost the more that youhave to you know the more kind ofsources you have the more data you'reindexing the more applications it's onlydriving up your cost and don't forgetthe cost of wasted time wasted effortlooking for thingsthere's also misinformation singlesource of Truth is a real problem andpeople don't really know what's thelatest what is verified information andwhat they should have access to or notultimately this all manifests itself ina really really bad experiencethe eight things you see on the screenhere are from multiple customerconversations telling us that Enterprisesearch is broken today and they wantsomething bettermaybe Jim you can talk a little bitabout your experienceum with this as wellthanks uh Rowan I can definitely uhhighlight some of the challenges ofEnterprise search so just a little bitabout Mayo Clinic like a lot ofcompanies we have sort of a publicfacing set of digital properties wemanage about 400 different digitalproperties mailclank.org being ourlargest uh in terms of public facing butintranet internals we also provideservices and you can see some of thestats on the screen here we have over1800 subsites many of those areWordPress based we have over 3000different authors that are authoringcontent any one timethese websites are very important todifferent work areas or team membersthey become a Channel of communicationin 2022 we did a major redesign of thatlook and feel so obviously thatpublic-facing content is much more brandaligned it's much more curated internalwe don't always follow those same setsof rules so we did do a Refresh on someof our top level Pages we also engagedand surveyed up to 800 employees and had20 different focus groups to learn whatare people seeking so that refreshingexperience definitely improved the waypeople find information but did notsolve the Enterprise search so one ofthose things on the right hand side ofthe screen here is what other kinds ofinformation are people seeking and it'snot surprising in a lot of companies I'mtrying to find a person how do I contactthem who's their manager I want to applyfor a job posting so what do I do toapply for that I have a question aboutmy password my password needs to resetcan I find information on that or do Ihave to call the service desk and talkto a human a human service agent sothese other aspects of that search arevery important so you can think ofconstellations of contentsome websites are very well curated soDepartment of Nursing is one of ourlargest intranet sites our nursing isour biggest Workforce and population atthe male clinic it becomes a key vehiclefor them to deliver and serve up contentbut they're also interested in theseother thingsunlike the public facing some contentchanges daily some content might changeonce a year and become stale so as oneof our challenges as we look atEnterprise search what do we want tobring into scope for searchingI think finally the thing around 600features what are those things so theseare ways these are kind of customboosters to provide higher level contentso you think about kind of ad placementso if I'm searching for how do I setreset my password in my promote a linkto our service desk or our websitethe reason we have so many is becauseour search relevancy is so bad and sowe're trying to balance this promotionof the right content we think you'reseeking when actually maybe not besearching that and provide that as astopgap member where we're at in thegenerative AI Journey you know we're inthat definitely an exploratory phaseexperiment phase we have a number ofproof of Concepts underway as you lookon the right hand side these differentsub sites so we have they each had theirown search mechanism as well so if youthink of our policy Library we have morethan four thousand different policiesit's a frequently visited place formanagers and employees seeking questionson benefits PTO and vacationwe also have a video exchange site thatarchives a lot of our meal public videocontent this is like medical Grandrounds other educational events so youhave sub searches within search andagain from an experience we're Desiringkind of more of a universal searchapproach to that contentum so that's that's it so our general AIsearch is very early in the processwe're publicly on the public facing sidewhere we have one of brand and Trust sowe're taking a very cautious approach ofterms of what does Enterprise or genderwith AI search mean for that we don'twant that to hallucinate and damage ourbrand internally our bar is fairly lowbut on the other hand we want to makesure that experience is good we're alsolike a lot of other companiesunderstanding the the search performancethe search costing mechanisms and howdoes that return value to the overallprocessing contentthose are my highlights Ron thanks yeahthank you Jim it's actually very similarto what we've heard from a lot of othercustomers as well they tell us searcheson the challenge and and generative AIis good right let's talk about whatgenerative AI has brought to search Iknow it's the it's the topic of the thehour the day the monthum and what we're seeing is that a lotof companies are beginning to bring thecapabilities of generative AI into theirsearch experiencesthey've started with things likevectorization making things more easilyunderstood and being able to drivesemantic searchesconversation is another one that we'reseeing more and more companies adoptingbeing able to converse back and forthpreserve context and keep theconversation goingsummarization especially as we'relooking across a variety of documentsum you know like I think you talkedabout things like vacation policysometimes well it changes depending onyour role I know for our companydifferent people have different vacationpolicies as well and then connectorsgetting access to as much information asyou can through a single pane of glassso that's where like people have beenfocused with generative AI but webelieve that there's still more to bedone and the next era of search isactually going to be able to push thisfurther stillstarting with personalizationhere's where you know every individualmight need to have a search result thatis unique to them that is to theircontext their role but more than thatwhat they're doing in that very momenttwo being being actually perceptivebringing information to you that you maynot have known that you even needed whenI start my day I'm very much in a youknow like a habitual emotion I'll openthe same three files talk to the same 10people but what if my search broughtinformation to me people contacts datauh presentations no matter what it isthat you know I didn't even know Ineededextensibility so here we're talkingabout not just giving us Blue Links noteven summaries but going beyond thatwhat if we had a widget what if we had atile that we could actually summarizeinformation a user-friendly way so Idon't have to read through an entiresummary sometimes and then finallyaction orientation closing the loop insearch today when you do search you haveto click on a Blue Link read a summarywhat if you could take an action rightin the search itself so you never haveto leave that and that's where we'reseeing search going nextI would say a new era of search is uponuswe've we've lived in a wireless search1.0 in the Enterprise for a very longtimethis was a world driven by keywordshaving the right word you have to searchfor connectors connecting to as manydata sources as you can and thensupporting a wide range of content PDFsdocuments maybe like metadata Json filesbut even there it came down to you knownot being able to find the rightinformation because you needed to knowthe keyword and oftentimes people returnto the person next to them and ask themhey where can I get this information sosearch was about knowing who to ask noteven what to search forthat was siled Sergeant I know many ofus are still living in that right nowwhere we are today is what we'll callEnterprise search at least as it's knowntoday it's about semantics it's aboutunderstanding what you want it's aboutbeing much faster in generating andretrieving the Blue Links and not havingto do multiple searches to get what youneedand it's about generation like we talkedabout summarization to some extentconversation as well but even then youstill need to know exactly what you'relooking for maybe not the keyword butyou need to have a pretty good sense ofwhat you're looking forand that's good but there's still morethat we can do and I think Enterprisesearch 3.0 is where the market will govery soon that's going to be aboutpersonalizationit's going to be about awareness andthat discoveryand of course action we think that thesethree elements are going to be thepillars of Enterprise search as we lookforward in the Yearsthat's boundaryless it's Universal andit's all through a single pane of glassso how do we make that happena few things right just going back tohow we think about search today1.0 focused on Specialized roles itfocused on looking at very narrow setsof data things that sat within yourEnterprise Network that was secured thatmaybe was in your data center and itlooked at like commonly usedapplications things that were like youknow indexed because maybe it's awebsite maybe it's your SharePoint orsomething of that sort very commonlyused filed it wasn't really like acrosseverything and we relied on Technologieslike tagging and indexingwhere we are right now is we're lookingBeyond we're looking at borderapplications things that we use outsideof our like core workflows so thinkabout Salesforce servicenow other thingsthat are like not necessarily core tothe work we do every day but are part ofour workflows we're looking at datathat's sitting in clouds multiple cloudswe're looking at data setting on ourpersonal devices as well and we're doingit in new ways like we talked aboutsummarization being able to chat largelanguage models of coursebut as we go ahead we're going to beable to enable new personas still notjust not just customers and not justemployees but Partners people that sitin more technical roles and machines aswell agents talking to one another thatcan run searches and be able to returnresults automaticallythat's going to require that we you knowexpand Beyond where we're looking fordata not just our core applications notjust our core data but even to boundaryapps and to even looking at metricstraces logs this has been a domain ofobservability for a very long timetwo we're going to need to look at datano matter where it is at the edge evenpublic data running a single search thatlooks across data within the Enterprisepublic data and data that your partnermight own or that you're subscribed toand then of course applying all thetechniques we've talked about thingslike reinforcement learning behavioralanalytics knowledge graphs these are allgoing to power this new era of searchso with that maybe I'll turn it over toyou Kalyan to talk a little bit aboutGoogle's vision for the spacethanks Ronso many of you have probably heard theannouncements that we made at thekeynote and others right so we are wellon our way to 3.0 and what we launchedearlier this year and we've taken toGeneral availability is what wasformerly known as Enterprise search nowvertex AI search and conversationright and so here this is the idea hereis to bring the power of Google Searchnow with generative AI capabilities ontoyour Enterprise data right and broadlywe think of this as as two big piecesone is anytime you're trying to enablesearch for your end users how can howcan Google search technology andgenerative AI help with that right sothis is search that you're providing foryour end users or customers but then amajority of the conversations that I'vehad are about like hey you know whatabout search internal to the Enterpriseright so like Rohan mentioned there'sall these systems that that you have towork with on a daily basis some of themhave a good search others not so muchbut then there's no single single Sourcesingle place that you can go to that youcan ask questions and find informationacross across the company right and sothe idea of like hey you know what whatdo we do from an internal researchstandpoint how can we make that betterhow can how can we improve um employeeproductivity so a lot of what we'velaunched over the past few months thingslike you know being able to ask naturallanguage questions uh get results uhthings like uh you know spellingCorrections are complete all that youwould expect from a from a Google searchexperience we have that in the productand then for those of you who are whoare the keynote and other announcementswe're starting off on our journey forconnectors right so we know that datawithin the Enterprise is just not in oneplace it's spread across all thesesystems so being able to connect tothose systems out of the box and andsearch through them almost in a blendedfashion so you don't have to you knowpick and choose one system over theother is where we're going right sowe've we've had connectors to the Googlebigquery and and cloud storage for forpast several months and today weannounced um this this week we announcedmore connectors starting with Salesforcejira conflict and there'll be many moreover the next few months but then sothat the idea of the core Google qualitysearch experience but now with the powerof generative AI this is like Rohanmentioned conversations summaries beingable to ask follow-up questions allthat's coming from the power of largelanguage models with search right andthen grounding in citations I cannotemphasize this enough right becausewe've all we've all worked with the llmsand some of you are thinking of puttingthese in production but then the biggestworry is you know what happens whenthese large language models produceinformation that you know is not fromyour Data Corpus or they've just madestuff up so we've invested quite a bitin this problem right I mean it's not asolved problem yet I don't think anyonecan can guarantee that there won't beany hallucinations but there's lots ofwork in Trying to minimize them tryingto make sure that you can actuallyTrace back the information in thesegenitive AI summaries back to yoursources right and that's that's the ideaof grounding these llms and then thecitations part is what gives youconfidence in in the output right and sowhen when in in vertex AI search when weshow you summaries we also show you thecitations where where is the firstsentence the summary coming from where'sthe second sentence of the summarycoming from so you can actually goverify and build confidence in that sothat's that's the citations partwhich I think is is uh is differentiatedin in uniqueand then Safe Search right so there'sthere might be filters you may want toput on your searches based on um basedon your policies that you eitherum either filter the search out or andthen the other other controls likeboosting bidding Etc so a lot ofconfigurability that you need within theEnterprise when you're building thisthis is not like a you know One-Stopshop just put something in place so thatthat's kind of like how we're thinkingabout internal search right being ableto give you the capabilities of searchand large language models with theseconnectors and flexibility and that'sthat's kind of what we've announcedright but we're just getting startedlike Rohan mentioned I think 3.0 is it'smuch more than search and large languagecapabilities this is aboutdepersonalization and analytics you knowpeople ask us hey you know what what ifwe could personalize the search to thespecific role or the specific workflowthat the um that your internal knowledgeworker is is going through and we've hada system like this in Google for manymany years or internally we call thisMoma and so for I search for somethingversus someone else does the the resultsare very much aware to our workflowsright and like the the work that we'redoing the documents that we've beenworking on Etc then the network ofpeople that we work with and that justmakes productivity so much betteranother example is is the idea ofKnowledge Graph right and so I I thinkwe've we've seen the era of likeindexing data and searching on it butbut there's probably deeper connectionswe can build from this data from acrossthese various systems right when andwith the connectors we've launched andwith uh identity management we canactually connect various pieces of thedata the people who are working on onvarious documents and start building aknowledge graph that powers oneDiscovery right so when you search youget higher quality search results butalso finding information that you didn'tknow to ask for the whole idea of likelooking looking forward right so that'sanother area of investment and then thethird one I'll highlight here is complexqueries with Advanced reasoning rightand so a lot of search so far has beenyou know we ask a query and we try tofind the most relevant documents andthen try to summarize that right thatsearch by definition but what we'reseeing with large language models andsome of the the research with you knowFrameworks like react act and and Langchain and others is being able to stringthese smaller tasks or information taskstogether to answer more complexquestions and several conversations I'vehad with customers the past six monthsare like the level of complexity theinformation task s that that you want tosolve is just going is going up and upright and so going from simple questionsto being able to ask complex questionsnow we think that's that's where thespace is going right so it's no moreabout a question and getting an answerit's about solving these more complexinformation needs that's another areathat we're investing quite a bit inso enough talking I'm going to switch toa demo and um this is uh this is a demothat shows a combination of the featuresthat we've launched what gives you asense of where we're going in the nextfew months I'm trying to trying to pieceall these Concepts together right andthe uh the scenario is still an internaluse case right so like an intranet usecase where there's ainternal knowledge workerworking on thissearch let me switch tohere so so this is think of this as aninternal search for a fictional companysymbol Labs right and what I'm showinghere is uh the the front page to yourinternal uh company information rightand so just like Google's almost likethe front page of the internet this isthe this is the landing page of thefront page for yourum company and a few things happeninghere right one this is a greatopportunity for a personalizedexperience for the um for the employeewhen they're coming in right so so whatthis is like the One-Stop shop singlepaneer glass and and so the recommendedcontent is something that yourorganization is pushing out to youremployees something that you want tohighlight maybe there's you know a newevent coming up maybe this openenrollment deadlines that that need tobe highlighted things like this but itcould also be personalized right itcould be personalized maybe there's aco-worker of yours whose anniversary iscoming up and that you want to highlightthere so they can actually send sendwishes so that's the idea of recommendedcontent right and then I'll show onemore thing here recently viewed this iswhat Rohan was mentioning earlier aboutin in workflow personalization right andso so usually you're you know you'reworking on a few documents you you'rehalfway through it you switch out andyou come back you don't need to go andand look for that document again this isa place which is like your your startingpage right so we tell you where you leftoff and we like pick up from pick up andcontinueand so that this this space is is foryou to customize right and so what whatwe'll give you is is the the tools thatyou can actually put information in hereand all the hooks that that make thatpersonalized okay so let's start somesearching right so let's say you've gota new employee right employee onboardingis actually one of the main use cases wehear about there's lots of new peoplejoining the company where do they findthe information that they need so let'slook at like a day one scenario let'ssay I'm a new employee at the companyandum I have obviously you have a lot ofquestions benefits policies payroll uhwhere to sign up Etc let's say I want toask a question about health insuranceright so we're going to copy this onefrom hereall right so ask what health insuranceplans are available obviously you knowdepends from company and Company so whenyou when you join a new placeyou want to see what's availableall right so there's a few thingshappening here notice there's a lot ofsimilarities to what's happening withthe the google.com search experience thesearch generative experience that umSundar talked about in the keynoteyesterdayum but I've highlighted a few things oneis I'll just scroll down here the searchresults right so what you're seeing hereis uh the power of Google search on yourinternal data right so finding the mostrelevant search results highlightingwhat actually matches from these uhdifferent search results and uh givingyou the option of obviously clickingthrough and and and and discovering moreinformation at the top here is a summarythat's coming from generative AI rightand so this is the idea of like takingthe most relevant information from thosetop search results creating a summaryandum you know reducing the time taken toto go look through all these documentsand then I'd also point out thesecitations here that I mentioned right sothe aspect of grounding is is showingyou where that information in thegenerative AI summary is coming from andyou can click through here and look atthe various sources right so that'sthat's the the basics right you got yoursearch you got your summary and thenI'll show conversation just a little bita few other things that I wanted tohighlight here rightum we talked about the idea ofconnectors and being able to likeconnect to these various third-partysystems and bring the information inwhat we've set up here is is a set ofconnectors to various third-partysystems right so I I'm showing rightthere we've got connectors set up to aSharePoint box jira Confluence slacklike I said we've got many moreconnectors coming in the next few monthsand we want to make this connector setupas easy as possible Right obviouslythere's going to be customizationsdepending on um you know the the systemsin your Enterprise but how can we getyou all started with connecting to thesesystems as quickly as possible and thenthen customize from then on and so oncewe set up these connectors the thesearch system is actually indexing thedata right we've got a few differentoptions one of the common questions Iget is how do you keep the data freshright data changes a lot in thesesystems and so we could do schedulefrequencies like you know 30 minutes 10minutes scheduled updates of this or youcould also trigger a re-indexing rightbut once that system's set up now theindexes are in sync and this search thatI just ran is running over theinformation from all those differentsources right sowhat you'll see here this first link iscoming from uh Confluence account thatwe've set up right and so this is a thisis a Confluence document the second oneis actually a Word document that issitting in Google Drive you know thefont's a little small but you can seedrive.google.com up there and there'smore Confluence articles in in moreGoogle Drive Etc you've got filters ontop here right so you can you can filteron those specific systems so the ideahere is Blended search right and thisthis is actually a pretty hard problemto solve because you know you gottathink about ranking and relevance acrossthe information from all these differentsystems not just one right a singlesystem itself is an interesting problembut blending the blending theinformation across all of those so youdon't have to go into each of these eachof these individual systems search andand find that informationso that was connectors the other thingwith connectors is access controls rightso the other common question I get ishey for like systems like SharePoint boxdrive and others you want to make surethat the user is only seeing theinformation in search that they haveaccess to you don't want to be showingone person's you know access informationto anotherum one of the jokes I heard was hey youdon't you don't want everyone seeing thesalary of your CEO if that's in somedocument right and so with connectorscomes access controls and so when we'reindexing data from actually fromconnectors we're also bringing in theaccess controls and the access controlsare being kept in sync as wellokay so then let's do a conversationalsearch experience right here's again thepower of generative AI with search nowwe've asked a question we've got a bunchof results that you can look at you gota summary but what if you want to refinethat search right almost in aconversational mode so let me ask afollow-up question and the sameidea of health benefitsokay so still staying on health benefitsthey said what inch what visioninsurance plans are available rightand so what's happening behind thescenes is it's keeping context of the ofthe conversation right so it is it knowsI'm asking aboutum health insurance plans it keepscontext runs the search again you seethe the results on the right hand sidehave refreshed so this is a new searchrunning and then a new summary iscreated for me what what about visioninsurance plans right and then there'sfollow-up questions as well so we cankeep going this is this is the idea ofconversational search refining uh thesearch until you get the information youwantnow let's take another scenario right solet's say now fast forward in time I'vespent more time with the company it'sbeen working through it and you know Iuse jira for for tracking my tickets andthenum you know I want to ask what are myopen Jiro tickets for example and andthis shows our integration with uh withjira here we'll copy this overforeignso you'll see just like before we've gota set of results now this is actuallycoming from jira right this is throughthe integration of of jira you'll see awhole bunch of tickets here we've alsopicked up on a Confluence base this isthe blending of results right and youcan change this ordering and throughsome of the configurations and boostingand varying things like that but you'llsee here we've also summarized what'shappening with these tickets right soeach ticket we've created a summary uhwhat I'll do here is I will filter onjiraand what this does is only show the jiratickets right so we've uh We've droppedthe the Confluence Pages upso that's another that's another exampleof like a search on a on a third-partysystemthe other thing we could do and this isuh let's say you're trying to find andfind experts within your company who areworking on say customer engineeringright this is where we're starting toget a little bit into the the knowledgegraph aspects of it but also connectingto your employee directory so here I'mgoing to saycustomercustomer engineeringsimulator with a filter hereso what's happening here is again searchresults just like before a summary isgoing to show up on what customerengineering is but you'll see this newpanel here about people right so this isbeing able to search for people withwith for experts within yourorganization who've been tagged withcustomer engineering as a role and inthe future as we expand this knowledgegraph functionality we'll be able toconnect these people to the documentsthat they've worked on maybe maybe youknow articles that they've authored onConfluence Etc and so you'll be able tosee people with the associatedinformation within the Enterprisecool I think that's uh that's most ofthe functionality and this is this isquickly evolving so you know we'll keepyou posted on what's Happening is youshould probably see some announcementsin the next few months as welland run anything else you want to add onthis no I think it's a great summaryyeah it's great cool all right so thenuh before I sign off here I want to showyou all one quick video of like how allthis might come together I know it'searly in the morning and so we've got apretty upbeat video to wake everyone upbecause they haven't gotten your coffeeso I'll go to slides hereand let's do it yeah[Music][Music][Music]thank you[Music]foreign[Music]thank youso this is more than just search nowright this is an AI powered Hub this issearch recommendations conversation andthe full power of genitive AI on yourdata with like the security privacy andthen compliance that you would expectfrom Google right and so we're excitedto to build this over the next fewmonths and you know I would love for allfor you all to come along yeah thank youthank youthank you"
