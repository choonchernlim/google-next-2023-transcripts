head of retail and cpghere at Google cloud in the US and we'vewanted this session today to really talkabout bringing to life all of theseInnovations in in Ai and dataum a lot of people ask me what thecompetitive Advantage is or how youbuild competitive advantage through Aiand I often say that the real secret isdriving adoption and so today what wehave are two of the best stories um forthe past 12 months of actually drivingadoption of AI in the Enterprise twocompanies that are in vastly differentplaces in their journey and I'll welcomethe team to to introduce themselves andwe'll get started run of show is we'lldo about 30 minutes of some questionsbetween myself and Michelle and thenwe'll hand it over to yourselves forsome q a so with that Emily yes[Music]Family Dollar and Dollar Tree bannerswell good morning I'm Ryan Schreck I amsenior director of store and Associatetechnology for Kroger my teams get tolead the delivery of technology for our2400 stores and nearly half a millionAssociates amazing good morningeverybody I'm Michelle McGuire ChristianI'm the chief commercial officer forconverged consumer by Deloitte which isa platform of AI and ml proprietarygenerally software that is purpose builtfor all things consumer industryincluding retail cpg Automotive QuickServe we'll hear a little bit more aboutit fromum the team here in a second but first Iwanted to share a little bit about howDeloitte is using Ai and convergeconsumer in conjunction with Google inorder to really accelerate to value forcustomers as well as get the most out ofyour technology by leveraging ourindustry expertise within software soconverge consumer is intended to beintegrated into the front middle backoffice it helps you know your customerpredict the demand for what productsthat they want and then optimize forPrice promotion and placement and thenultimately provide a personalizedmarketing experience that moves peopledown the funnel faster and some of youmay have seen last week we announced ourpartnership with Google where we aregoing fully Cloud native on gcp andleveraging cortex vertex and looker inorder to help partner with retailconsumers customers so a little bit moreabout that in a second but first Ithought we'd talk a little bit about howKroger is leveraging associateproductivity inside of convergedconsumer so tell us a little bit moreabout how you leveraged it yeah so whenyou think about our opportunity atKroger we get to serve 11 millioncustomers every day and so the work thatour Associates do to serve thosecustomers really has to be prioritizedand prioritized tightly but what happenswhen you have a truck that's late for adelivery or an associate that calls insick they can't make their shift and youhave to be able to shuffle thatprioritization so we took data that'scoming from Transportation time andattendance inventory in other places andwe started to help that storere-prioritize the most valuable work sothat they could uphold that full freshand friendly experience that we'retrying to deliver every customer everytimeit's a great consumer example of how theconsumer is impacted by data backed byhow Associates are optimizing within thestore so we'll get to more of that in asecond but Emily tell us a little bitabout how converged consumer istransforming Marketing in the pilot thatyou're doing yeah absolutely so as acompany Dollar Tree spoken openly aboutthe transformation Journey that we're onit's early days but we're making reallygood progress we had a pilot last yearthat we did together that was reallyabout helping us to build that dataFoundation that has much richer customerInsight than we use today and we wereutilizing that alongside the launch ofor we launch by smart coupons program sowe don't have a traditional loyaltyprogram that collects all that greatfirst RT data so we have a couponprogram instead so we were able to usethat data partner with pervertedconsumer to really make it richer andthen personalize the marketing campaignso then find the right Shoppers and youknow out in the open web and then Targetthem with relevant messages to come backso really successful and just from thatsmall pilot we saw a 20 increase intraffic so really happy great it's agreat example and Ryan when when youthink about I think the success that youboth had there were two things thatreally jumped out at me the first wasthat you both started with a real clearobjective in mind right bothorganizations in different places asyou've sort of talked can you talk tothe to the group here about what thatobjective was when you really started itand how we let the technology fulfillthat and then I'd also like to hear fromyou about the things that you've learnedthrough the experience I think oftenwhen we get into these sessions peoplelearn more about perhaps some of thebumps along the way so Ryan can youstart off like what were the bigobjectives that we were trying to solveat Kroger with this workum and what were the learnings that youwent through during that experience yeahthe you know the first objective wewanted to start off with that nightly uhstocking activity because we know thatif you get that stocking activity rightthe store's in great condition as youopen up the next day and you also have areally good customer experiencethroughout that day and so it really hadto do with the arrival of that productat the store how we take it from theback to the front of the house andultimately get it onto the shelves forthe customers to pick and in the courseof doing this we learned there's a lotof data that already exists that we knewabout but we weren't using the samemanner that we wanted to now and so aswe started to combine again that datafrom inventory and transportation wereally had to go through a lot ofcleansing of that dataum but then make it really simple forthe associate to see that next best taskand activityum and we learned a lot as we wentthrough the process because theassociate had to understand the theaction and say that makes sense to meand what I need to do next it's reallyinteresting because I think the firsttime we'd seen in retail in this whitespace where operational solvers reallyleveraged to optimize constraints so youknow Ryan's there's been a few examplesthere but the fact that you can knowthat a truck's late means thatAssociates aren't going to unload orwait to unload that truck or even thisidea of through the work that Deloittedid of what the value of the next bestactivity is and being able to to debatethat in I think has been reallytransformational Emily what about fromyou guys where you started because asyou've said the transformation is verypublic and so you started from adifferent vantage point I love the wayyou talk about the uh opportunity thatyou have the LeapFrog yeah so it was umI choose from my prior experience soI've seen retailers make the mistakewhen they buy a solution and thebusiness isn't ready for it and thenthey quickly become frustrated becausethey can't Leverage potential they can'tscale in the way they want to and reallyit then comes back and you knowunfortunately on the partner thatthey've chosen so we were reallypurposeful in starting small so thepilot isn't actually any comment onDeloitte or on Google it was more tomake sure that we were testing ourinternal capabilities so that was reallythe main learnings from it so we learneda lot about our data Readiness and ouraccess which wasn't where we needed tobe and then we also learned about on ourmeasurement which if we were to be ableto measure the level that we wanted towith the granularity that we wanted towe needed to work on those things tooand can I just ask one follow-up to bothof you because one of the key successesand I think in particular at Kroger Ryanwas that you know we got 30 000Associates using this platform in Under12 months and you know I think that thatis the biggest sort of achievement outof all of this because that adoption nowis driving the machine learning how didyou all work to actually get you knowwhat was the the interconnect betweenyourselves and operations and I didDeloitte had a huge part of that workbut can you talk to to that sort ofexperience yeah we had a greatcollaboration first with our businesspartners and Retail Ops um and ourtechnology department and Retail Opsreally worked hand in hand but we hadgreat collaboration with both Google andDeloitte throughout the process a numberof long nights spent at stores by theteams to really to go and see and that'sa big part of what we try to do everyday is get out into the stores seewhat's happening before you start tocreate the tech solve and soas that collaboration continued toflourish and we started to get feedbackfrom the associates you're right uh Josewe went I think 16 weeks to our firstpilot and it wasn't just a simple pilotit was a pretty in-depth pilot and thento an Enterprise deployment within 12months or less and so the speed for 2400stores and half a million Associates wasincredible and that was a big learningfor us is how fast we continue to pushnot only the Innovation but mostimportantly the adoption by theassociates it's amazing and what aboutyou and your marketing team yeah so if Ifor us actually one of the biggestlearnings is we had to partner with ourItt y team actually because I can go andask you things it's really easymarketing always has these fancyrequirements but it's our it team thathas to deliver on it so we worked reallyclosely with our it team and I'mfortunate to have a team that's verycollaborative and does listen to us onwhat it is that we want to we want totry and do and it's just so importantyou know along with working with ourinternal Partners like RIT but alsoexternal partners because that's whathelps us go faster and then when we doface those problems which we will faceand we continually face everyone's kindof leaning in to figure out how we cansolve them togetherit's a great point so you mentionedgoing faster yes Google next is allabout what is next and so when you thinkabout the evolution of how you're goingto use data in your organizations tellme a little bit about what thatEvolution might look like for yourmarketing department yeah so right nowwe are working together to really expandin that data Foundation that we built sothat's a customer segmentation that'sthe enrichment of our first party dataso we have a really good understandingof what our customers are doing not onlyin our stores but what they're doingoutside of our store so as I mentionedwe don't have the benefit of a loyaltyprogram plus Family Dollar is much moreof a filling trip than a primarydestination which means we don'tnecessarily understand fully what acustomer is doing outside of our storesso converge is really going to help uson that Journey so I'm excited thatafter we get the foundation in placethere are so many use cases that we'llsuddenly be able to deliver on andpersonalization is a big one of them butwe have to do this first yeah and for usputting gen AI on what you already haveas insights being able to put that inmarketer's hands to make it easy promptbased and then action that is what'snext for us but how about for you guysthe evolution of data yeah we thinkabout data we've taken some of thesources I talked about already and nowwe're starting to think about what arethe next set of data sources we can usehow do we start to think about rfids howdo we think about video and ultimatelywhat does that mean again for theassociate trying to serve the customerso the great part when you walk into oneof our stores and let's say you go backto a meat counter and you're looking fora cut of meat and you don't know exactlywhat you want we want that point in timeexperience with the customer to be theonly focus of that associate we don'twant to worry about what inventory orwhat am I ordering for the next day sohow do we take these new data sets andlet that meet counter clerk do the thingthat they do best and really helpsupport the customer in connectingcustomer data to store data superpowerful in terms of next best actionnext best offer in the case of marketingso it's good stuffBrian can you talk a little bit abouthowyou're starting to go from that narrowuse case in the night shift and thengoing across departments going acrossshifts and and that kind of thinking atKrogeryeah certainly sometimes there'sexpertise that you have to have withinyour given Department in the store butwe also are looking at how do we make iteasier for you to move acrossdepartments so that if we need to focuson produce and many of our areas offresh which is so important to ourcustomers then we can move our talentedstaff our labor and our Associates overto that department where they need themost help and so really at first itstarted in a single department and asingle function and now we're thinkinghow do you look across all of thosedifferent departments so maybe you movesomebody from stocking Dry Goods cerealsover into produce and perishables whichhas been a really interesting sciencechallenge right because theinter-departmental needs are quitedifferent the skill sets of Labor isalso quite different and I know that youknow buy online and pick up in store hasbeen a great area Emily how about youwhen you think about the expansion ofthe the use cases and the work how areyou all thinking about you know buildingon the success of the first POC andbroadening that out I I think this is isgoing to be the foundation for so muchof what we do so right now you know if Italk a little bit about Family Dollarwhich is where we're focusing first wehave 8 300 stores so we are acrosscountry we're in urban rural suburbanand then we have different formats ontop of that and then we also serve avery diverse customer base and a lowerincome customer base so Mass doesn'twork for us so what I'm really excitedabout is being able to be much morerelevant to our customers and do that ina way that really connects with them andmake some seed scene and head and that'sgoing to be across everything that we doso that's going to be across our own andoperator channels that's how we engageour app but then into our paid mediastrategy and actually how we connectwith customers Beyond as we try andbring your customers in because it'sbeen a real breakthrough right I meanthe amount of first party data that youhad versus what converged consumers nowadded to that understanding of ofcustomers is is unbelievable it's unreallike so on top of our you know ourlimited but decent first party data therichness that we're getting fromconverged consumer the insights that wehad is into where else they're shoppingyou know Fuller demographics you knowtheir interests their Hobbies reallyallows us to be very focused veryPrecision orientated and make our verylimited marketing budget work a lotharder for usit's a great point we have over 10 000sources of data in that data set frominsights IQ and it's interesting thatyou mentioned that because traditionallywhen we think about data we think aboutite and core infrastructure but nowmarketing is being asked to lean in tellus a little bit about that Journey asmarketing marketers become more datascientists with some tech as abackground so I think I'm lucky that Ican leverage on my prior experience atDunham B so that was one of you know thethings that was really exciting to mecoming to Dollar Tree and it's somethingthat I'm really advocating for in theteam so I'm probably a little moreinvolved than you'd see the average CMOprobably sometimes a little bit tooinvolved for my team two involved withthe Deloitte team but it really worksour favor because if I'm asking our youknow my marketing team our company totransform and do new things that wedon't necessarily know how to do I haveto leave from the front yeahRyan one of the things that I foundreally inspirational we started theproject was thatum you would think that laborproductivity could lead to reduction inin staff and actually from the outsetthe number one thing Kroger told us wasthat improving the experience ofAssociates was really the key metricright because you wanted to driveretention can you talk a little bitabout that how technology is actuallyenabling you to not only driveproductivity but drive retention andjust have a a more engaged Workforceyeah I think building off my priorexampleum when you talk to that clerk thatknows cuts of meat I mean they've builtthat expertise over so many yearsand so as we think about retention it'sreally getting the skills and talentsand abilities that they have that theylove doingum making most of their job thatfunction and so as we looked at thisit's absolutely a way that we can helpDrive retention not only for thoseAssociates that have been with us for 20yearsum that know that work but also for thenew Associates that are coming in thatwe want to stay with us for 20 years sohow do we make their job a whole loteasier as they learn the ropes as theyget up to speed and we think a lot of itis using the tech to complement whatthey already know so that feedback loopis so important as we're out in storesas we systematically also gather thatfeedback for did that activity take theamount of time that we thought it shouldhave did we give you the right supportand knowledge that you needed and so wehave a great two-way Communicationchannel that's now connecting from ourstores back into our Ops teams and ourdivision teams as well into our otherareas like supply chain and that is thereal secret of adoption driving AIbecause all of the models that we'vebuilt in collaboration with programDeloitte they're now feeding off of thisso if an associate takes 30 secondslonger to do a task on average that'spowering all of the insights and theinformation that we have Emily how aboutyou in terms of training upskillingrecruiting like have you seen that sortof Challenge and you and I were chattingthe other day about you know yourability to attract talent because it'sso exciting about the transformation howare you finding that sort of shift in inTalent profile at Dollar Treehungry like for for this transformationand they've been waiting so it's areally exciting time for us all and youknow again deloitting being great forleaning in and helping us and reallytaking us on that on that Journeyum but yeah we're also able to attractsome great talent and that's not justwithin marketing that's actually acrossthe organization because when you go outand you talk about this amazing storyabout the Transformations you're goingto have for a retailer that has over 16000 stores but something that peoplewant to be part of yeahI'm curious I'm hearing two sides of apersonalization story here right I'mhearing from a marketing perspectivethis is how we communicate to thecustomer from the store perspective thisis the experience we want them to havewhen they're in the storeum tell me a little bit about whatpersonalization looks like in the futurewith Gen AI as the promise from a storeassociate perspective or a marketerperspective yeah so we today are lookingat a prescriptive set of tasksand new things that are happeningDynamic things happening and how do wereprioritize and so again there's alittle bit of reactivity to that so whenwe look at gen Ai and we talk about theexamples I used around RFID and videonow we start to think about how do webecome a little bit more proactive andthinking the next best task to focus onthe customer but that task is arrived atthrough even more data sources morestreams that is far beyond what we couldhave individuals determine yeah butthere's a level of confidence in thattask as well because it's happenedacross 2400 stores consistently whenthis occurs this is the next thing we doand therefore this is the outcome we getto serve a customer and it's married tothe message right it's married to themessage that they've seen before theycome in the store so tell me a littlebit about the promise of General yeahfor you so I'm really excited about itsability to help us personalize at scaleso we know that's one of the biggestchallenges is easy to personalize to anaudience of one but if your audience isin a 30 40 million and you still want tohave that individual message that'swhere Janai is going to come in andreally help us do that the other thingthat I'm excited about actually is theefficiencies that it can drive so we'rea lean mean marketing team but it'sgoing to help us you know some of thatkind of basic work that we need to do toget campaigns ready you can take thatheavy lift off us and we can focus muchmore on driving our strategy andaccelerating our transformationwhat were the biggest challenges I Ithink I asked before but I really wantto get to like what if you were to startagain knowing what you know and likewhat would be the things that you wouldjust rethinkum especially with the new technologiesthat are coming on on online like whatwere the pain points that you know folkscould steal and reapply or or avoid interms of the work you've been doingto be able to leverage a lot of my pastexperienceum and so that's why we chose theapproach to kind of go slow to help usgo faster because I know that if we testand we get the fundamentals right that'sgoing to be the foundation that we thatwe need to scale but I think overallconsidering our transformation wherewe're at it's a sequencing so that's thehardest part actually is making surethat we set up our transformation in theright order so we're doing things in thecorrectum order so that they come online whenwe need them to and that we're notcatching ourselves when we're head ofthe curve so I've got personalization Iwould love to do that to the level ofgranularity that I want to today but Iknow that I need to be patient and so Ihave to wait which is a hard one and youknow the IT team often feel that from mebecause if they don't give you theguardrails I'm going to tell them I wanteverything right now and it's literaltrue story it's happened so that's alearning curve for me as well it's justbeing patient but knowing that if you dothat and you sequence your activities inthe right order and you do focus onsetting your strong foundation in placeyou're going to be much kind of betteroff when you come to scaling and reallytrying to reap those benefits and thefuture and Ryan we had so manychallenges just wrangling different datasources that had never been wrangledtogether right from HR systems toLogistics to supply chain and also thenthe adoption and the feedback and somepretty you know uh less successfulmeetings in stores when we were gettingthe first feedback what about you likewhat would what would be I know it wassuper quick and the project was verysuccessful what were the big learningslike what would what would youfundamentally do differently do youthink yeah well as I mentioned wecertainly love the speedum that we wentum and the speed was not necessarily attimes all of the data wrangling whichyou're right there was it was stitchingtogether this data from Legacy sourcesfrom you know in-store versus gcp andother Cloud environments and you know inour data centers but at the end of theday it was also about taking the time toget the feedback so we had to make surethat we don't go so fast with the MVPsolutions that we forget to spend thetime in the stores and that's what Ilove about the collaboration between theteams is that we took the time to spendin the middle of the night in the storesto listen firsthand how did this workfor you did it make your night easier asyou were stalking and so I love thisspeed but you're right the stitchingtogether the data will continue tobecome one of the biggest opportunitiesI think for us and many retailers as youlook at all these different disparatedata sources and all of those datasources are changing at the same timetoo so that's I think the opportunitygoing ahead is the data landscape getseven more complexdefinitely it speaks to probably havingto be good stewards of the data acrossyour organization so tell me a littlebit about how you are organizing aroundoperations and data and governance andhow you're working with those differentbusiness units to Shepherd it into theplaces that you need it yeah I you knowour teams with our business partnerswork pretty closely with a number ofdifferent areas related to governanceand data privacy and so forth so thatwe're looking at that data we're makingsure that we're we have the not only theavailability of it but the right usecases so that we can ultimately delivera solution like what we did here forassociate productivity yeah and it has amarketing lens being a data Stewardmeans something a little different butwhat's your approach I think for some ofit we're learning as we go actually sowe've never had to do these things sowe're putting in place new policies aswe as we go on the Fly we're putting inin place compliance committees and we'relearning actually a lot of it togetherbecause we have new people coming onboard so it's creating brand new usecases a new in the company that wehadn't have needed before I think theone thing that you know we're going tofind interesting as we go through thisnext phase of the journey in thetransformation is really changing theinternal mindset because we're going togo from being a customer first companythat really relies on data to rely oncustomer data and that's something thatagain is going to be a new thing thatwe're all going to have to learntogether yeahum the work you guys have been doing issuper visible in the boardroom and haveyou been managing upwards the executivesum you know perhaps folks that are evenfurther away from the realities of thetechnology that needs to be managed youknow most the conversations I'm havingis you know gen AI when will it fixeverything in the business tomorrow sohow have you been managing that sort ofexpectation and the results that you'redelivering and any advice you canprovide thereI mean I'm lucky I've got a verysupportive executive group and andbecause we're doing this all togetherit's a very transparent process so we'rein there we have stereco meetings everysingle week and we do have to report onon our performance and our results and Ithink you know what's great about theway that it's not marketing pushing thisagenda for transformation is the wholecompany it means we're on that journeyand if something works and it's going todeliver the results we have that supportso it's a really exciting place for meto be to get to actually showcase to alot of our teams that normally wouldn'tbe involved like real estate and Ops tosee what it is that marketing is doingand what about you Ryan now that you'vesent the Benchmark of being able to doso much in so little time uh how haveyou been managing sort of the the seniorstakeholders at Kroger yeah I think wehave to distill this AI buzzword intoreally what does it mean in the contextof your businessum and so for us it's meantum how do we provide again the toolsthat help the associates do what they doreally well service our customers whenwe think about fall fresh and friendlyin our stores what does AI mean to thatand distilling it down to reallydiscrete use cases and I love the waythat we all started at the beginningwith here's our use case get the storeready get it set get the stocking doneat night support those Associates andyou're going to have a great start toyour day and your customers are going tobe really happy with the condition ofthe store and the experience they get sowe've been distilling it back down intoreally discreet use cases and thenstarting to then show what the new techis able to do versus what we may havehad access to in the pastokayso maybe I'll ask about I ask you aboutthe evolution but now what are thethings you're going to take away fromhere and go home and try in each of yourorganizations be it gen AI be it thetech specific what's literally next foryou guysyeah so I go back to how do we enablethe whole store to work togethercollectively instead of a givendepartment so certainly our Focus aroundhow we're managing inventory it's alwaysmaking sure that that full promise tothe customer it needs to ensure that wehave the right inventory the rightproducts available at that point in timebut you also might be a pickup customeryeah so how are we looking at thedifferent channels as well so it's notjust the different roles but thedifferent channels and all of those aredata signals how do we ingest them andthen make it really simple for thatassociate to do to do the next bestthing yeahyou said you have a backlog what's nextfor you guys so we do have a backlog soyou know next may be a little bitfurther out for us but I think you knowthe takeaways that I'll have is you knowhelping to paint the picture of thefuture for execs that's really what thisis going to be be really valuable forshowing what is going to come and whatthe future is but also probably evolvingour use cases because what we need to dowhen we're going through atransformation is making sure we don'tbill for now we've built for next sothat's really where this is going to bebeneficial for us yeah right so we're atthe sort of three minute warning and Iwanted all of us just to close outsideof necessarily our day jobs we'reobviously in the mix of I think the mostexciting technological Revolution that'simpacting retail and and consumer whatexcites you the most like in terms ofthe art of the possible and and what'scoming next whether you're applying itor not just as as leaders in thisindustry what really excites youMichelle I want you to answer this oneas well maybe you kick us offyeah I'm excited about whatTech can solve with a purpose so notjust our day jobs right how everybody'sgoing to go and apply it to their dayjob but how do we use Tech AI to solvethe big hairy problems of the world likeclimate change and homelessness andusing the you know everybody here as atechnologist our powers for good tochange society and some of the thingsthat I've seen I'm I'm really bullish onthe promise of really changing the worldthat we live in awesome Ryanyeah we often talk aboutum you know as you come in and you shopour stores or you uh buy online and wedeliver or you pick upum we we step back even from that welook what are we providing to ourcustomers and to our Associates and it'sreally that ability to gather aroundfood and like many of the folks herethat are going to enjoy a meal togetherthis afternoon or dinner together thisevening it's being able to connect inperson and so for us how can we helpbetter set that tablefor the customers and better enable ourAssociates to enjoy doing it and we havegreat tools now we have data that'sgoing to come together so muchdifferently than I had in the pastfor me it's all about doing better forour customers so I'm very customermotivated with Family Dollar we talkabout helping you do more so this isgoing to help us do more for ourcustomer you know she's a and we do talkabout her being she she's an underservedyou know um individual who often isstruggling and and you know to make endsmeet so this is going to help us be muchmore relevant to her much morepersonalized and really made thatstronger connection and be there forwhen she needs us it's awesome I thinklook what I've been really excited inthese past sort ofum let's call it eight months in termsof this revolution has been thedemocratization and access of datascience more broadly in in companies anda lot of the things that used to beperhaps foundational and some costs thatorganizations weren't reflecting on thevalue of them the platforms the datahave now become top of mind and you haveboardrooms that are really focused inand interested in solving this theencouragement that I would give you allin in working and speaking with so manycustomers is to think about the use casebut think of the use case and think ofthe platform that in enables that usecase in parallel I think that theorganizations that are mostsophisticated right now that are reallythinking about this in a way that aroundscale and a driving scale and adoptionare taking a view of the world thatenables all of these capabilities from aplatform perspective so think about ifwe're going to leverage voice in onepart of the company how do we ensurethat that use case really then enablesuh every part of the company to leverageit whether it's the customer serviceorganization whether it's the storeorganization whether it's the financeorganization the same thing with searchthe same thing with a chat so buildingout platform and product capabilitiesbecome really important I think we'vetoday seen two really great examples oftwo organizations that are fundamentallyin different places and their ability tostart with that objective in mind thatend goal and then work backwards fromtechnology I often use the analogy andmany of you probably heard me say thisthat you know with Google we provideflour and eggs we have phenomenalPartners like Deloitte that bake cakesthat are really the end outcome thatwe're trying to deliver for associatesand customersexcellent right so unfortunately we areat time thank you so much for engagingfor the questionsum plug if you thank you[Music]"
