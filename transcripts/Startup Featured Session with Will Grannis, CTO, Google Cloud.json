    "transcript": "hey everybody how's next going so fargood yes hopefully awesome love thatso a little background my name isAllison wagenfeld and I head upmarketing for Google Cloud I've beenwith Google since 2016. actuallytogether with will we were justreminiscing about the good old days andour very early next conferences and sowe have come a long way and certainlyone of the areas we've probably come thefarthest is our investment in workingtogether with the startups that are sucha core part of what we believe in and inour kind of roots at Google and sothrilled that you are all here with ustoday as well and a little more by wayof background for myself I came fromVenture Capital right before I came overto Google so I was a partner atemergence Capital where I was anoperating partner there working with allof our portfolio companies on their goto market strategies and also aninvesting partner as well so it'sparticularly fun for me because becauseI've always been an entrepreneur and aninvestor in fact even going further backI started my career out in SiliconValley at Intuit where I was the founderof Quicken Loans when I was there so Iwrote that original business plan andhelped scale that before we spun it outand went over to a Connor Perkins backstartup as the second employee myselfafter that before doing a couple otherthings and now of course here at Googleso thank you for joining us here today Iam honored to be here with Will Granniswho's the chief technology Officer ofGoogle Cloud but of course we have lotsof other backgrounds here as well soactually we'll take a seat all right anduh welcomeum yeah so great to be here togetherwith you we were joking that will hashad many hats here and in addition tobeing I guess in your pre-google days astartup founder and we'll go back inthat story as well but also working nowreally at scale with octo and he evendid a stint of helping out in our publicsector business as well so if any of yousell into the public sector at all besure to catch will and ask them a coupleof questions about that as well becausehe has a lot of unique insights there sothrilled to be here yes absolutely soAllison an icon in the startup world Ifeel like um in your Shadow today butthat's okay because uh you know a lot ofa lot of uh the inspiration for comingto Google was to unlock uh what we sawwhat I saw from outside as reallyinteresting capabilities and unlock thatfor everybody and a fun fact you knowour business is built gcp was built onstartups and digital natives scalingvery quickly and then the Enterprisescame you know in kind of the normaladoption curve so one I reallyappreciate all of you and yourinvestment in time and you know patienceas we learn to get things right in theplatform and our documentation and ourquick starts but you know it's companieslike yours that built gcp in the firstplace and I I really strongly believeit's going to be companies like yoursthat keep the momentum going and help usachieve our goals so thank you you somuch for being here as Allison mentionedso you know I'm probably not the thefanciest you know founder of all time Ihave started uh you know a couplecompanies I've been an early stageemployee in companies I've doneeverything from modified Digital Signalprocessors to shoot out energy in acertain way so you know we can we canclose the link on l-ban satellitetransceivers and do some things in theadvanced Telco Worldum and I've also been on the other sideuh having been investor advisor advisorhere at Google Ventures Google Capitaluh been on the defense Innovation boardwith Eric Schmidt uh here so for thoseof you in the public sector and lookingto you know apply technology for publicgood uh you know happy to happy to chatuh but I think like the sum of all thoseexperiences have it's been an oddJourney for me so you know kind of lotsof small companies lots of big companiesI've worked in for three fortune 100s askind of a advanced r d weirdo someonewho's trying to like plow the ground forthe rest of the business that no onereally understands so maybe you canidentify with some of that becauseyou're trying to lead a market sometimeson ways that you know bigger companiesdon't understand and so you're takingadvantage of that dislocation that'sreally my job here too at Google so isthe CTO I think the reason I'm a CTOhere is because I built stuff and wewere looking for someone who built a lotof things in the Enterprise who had beenhere for a sufficient amount of time toknow something a little bit about a lotbecause it's impossible for one personto know everything about everything so Ido you know have my strengths andweaknesses as wellum but the CTO I'm gonna can I let themin on a little secret it's sure I shouldsay it depends but sure go for it okaygreat uh yeah here we gookay soum you know the CTO origin story I thinkit's important for you to know that theDNA of Google Cloud was always trying tobe very mindful of building a bridgefrom our technology uh to all of you andso we didn't have a CTO function when Ishowed up and for a year you know I wasworking on some of these kind of likefirst of use cases with some uh you knowdigital natives uh like you know Shopifyand Spotify and others who are you knowfoundational customers now and afterabout a year of doing that you know Igot a phone call one day and you knowoars and you know Diane Green at thetime Brian Stevens and Brian Stevenswho's the head of product they said youknow whatwe really should solidify our bridgebetween our technology and the peoplethat need to understand how best to useit in really the most complex scenariosand my guess is most of those are goingto be in areas where you're at becauseyou're pressing the platform in a waythat you know isn't necessarily like abig kind of pattern It's actually anemergent pattern and so in a lot of waysour team was designed uh to be veryhelpful to you know companies like yoursand I'm extremely uh happy with howthings have gone with some of thoseearly customers and I hope you know thatwe can also help in your journey and soI'm looking forward to your engagementin this session and Beyond yeah I mean Iremember when we named the group oh mygosh it was like so it was like shouldit be the CTO office and then it waslike okay we'll read the office of theCTO so that's where the Octo thing camein and then there was like this wholegroup of people who were talking to ciosand we're like startups don't have ciosthat's such like a big enterprise-ything so there was like this all thisconflict about the CIO and the CTO soit's very very much Happy where we endedup with the Octo CTO and to this day I'mstill scratching CIO out of lots of allof the marketing materials anytime ittouches anything related to startups orscaling companies I was like that's justnot a scale term yeah I had one pro tipI'm sure you know the head of marketingwould appreciate is that you need a coolacronym right if you want to succeed andso we needed something Office of the CTOocto you know we have a logo we havelike a little octopus we do all thethings that I'm sure all of you beingvery Scrappy have had to do as well ofcourse they've made the logo withoutrunning it by marketing of course I waslike you're still willing to hang outwith me so I appreciate that thank youso maybe talk a little bit about ityou've hired Tech teams over the yearshopefully everybody here is at the phaseof hiring Tech teams certainly aftergetting all the credits that we'regiving you all as you scale and buildyour particularly those of you workingin New AI companies talk a little bitabout hiring Tech teams scaling earlyTech teams what are some of the LessonsLearned sure uh again this is just myexperience since you know everybody'skind of a product of their own uh youknow kind of experiences so probablyprinciple number one at least what hasworked or things that I didn't do that Ishould have done that I'm now applyingas a principal to do number one isI think I gravitated in the companies Iwas building I was trying to bringpeople in that I got along withand that was like a top principleand over the years I actually havegotten the most value in relationshipsand building especially complextechnology where the patterns aren'tclear yet with with people whoum I can get along with but alsoprobably challenge me more and so Iwould say like if you're building out ateam one thing to always keep in mind islike you know do you have enoughChallenge and frictionto really progress or is it an echochamber and that's actually somethingthat I even try to solve for I you knoweven now my my team isn't you know thebiggest team at Google we're prettysmall Scrappy team of Engineers but umyou know I'm always looking for who canI add to the team that will give us aperspective that actually almostcontradicts something that we're holdingright now is Dogma or an acceptedprinciple so you know number one likecreate the friction yeah sometimes itburns out and sometimes it's not greatbut the benefit you have a startup is ifyou decide you can take quicker actionso that's that's probably number onenumber two and I was not again this issomething I wasn't great at that I kindof learned over the yearspick the area that you really personallyso if you're like a technical founderCTO founder CTO CEO kind of comboespeciallyum where's the area that you really wantto spend time in and give the restto other people and I found that wasalways difficult for me because I kindof like having my fingers in everythingI like knowing what's going on and thisis where the CEO and Tech lead rolesblur into each otherum but I found that if I wasn't willingto let go and give some space to youknow up like for exampleum in one of the startups that I did wewere we were using unsupervised learningand kind of k-means and other things toCluster up signals coming from uh cyberendpoints and try to predict you knowbad things that didn't have a CV acritical vulnerability pattern againstand I was like oh this is great uh butthere were some parts of thatarchitecture that I needed to kind oflet go especially like the cloud bits ofit ironically I gave the cloud bits awayin that company I spent more time onlike more of the machine learning andthe algorithm part and the design partso you know as a technical founder forthose of you out there that are kind ofblurring the lines between the CEO andCTO the more you can articulate whatparts are really important to you andthat you want to keep your technicalchops in it'll allow you to bring peoplein uh you know in those othercomplementary functions it's also asignal later on I think it plays as youscale it's also a good habit to get intobecause it's kind of like you could I'mgoing to over generalize you know youmay say This is BS that's okay with meum you can be like a technical fellowyou can be uh you know a business leadyou can be a talent developer but youhave to pick two of thoseand really coming to grips with what Ilove to do and so for me you know I gaveup managing much bigger organizations inp l like I've LED you know businessesthat were billions of dollars as uh CEOGM and I just found that I really reallyliked smaller teams and I really reallyliked the technical bits and I reallyliked the talent bits um so I kept thoseand I gave up the other one yeah nothat's great to understand that andactually have that self-reflection myguess is your first startup you probablyhad a little less reflection and alittle bit more of the time went onum but that's that's what the learningswell uh maybe dovetail on that umone thing that really helped me over theyears was uh having an advisor a mentorthat was outside of my circlewe shall call him Bob todayuh because I didn't clear with him youknow that I was going to talk about infact I don't even think I told you I wasgoing to talk about thisum but this was a person who alwaysasked me like the question and then dugin a little bit and then gave me somehard truths and over the span of acouple different companies in fact thesecond company that I started the onlyreason I think we were successful isbecause he challenged me on a veryspecific Topic at a very specific timeand he's the only onewhen you're in charge people won't tellyou the truthI'm sorry it's just true like we'rehumansum and if you can find people that doyou keep them you hold them close andyou value them foreverum and it just so happened that I foundthis person while I was a I was a CTO ina big Fortune 10 company and uh I bumpedinto him in a board of advisors meetingand immediately we started uh you knowgoing back and forth and he became alifelong asset so kind of like a 1B onTalent there's the organic Talent withinyour company but you as a Founder CTO orbusiness lead you need somebodyuh calling you out and if you look atall the like companies that havesucceeded there was this great bookabout uh coach in the valley and uh mostsuccessful I mean the one about BillCampbell yes yes okay he was actuallyone of my first like mentors and advisorinto it he was the CEO of Intuit when Iwas there yeah there you go I mean itand it's a common story you hear thisall the time and if you don't havesomebody like that making that apriority may sound like you don't needit or maybe that's trivial advice but umlike I'm a data person so I'm likelooking at the correlation and all thecompanies that actually make it throughthese things of scale and that thefounders and the technical Foundersmaintain control and maintain a you knowlike the rudder on the ship as it scalesout that's one common trait yeah no it'sactually so interesting so I rememberactually talking to Bill Campbell oncewhen there was something with QuickenLoans that wasn't going right and he'slike you're hearing it all in Stereo tome and the co-founder I was with howcome you don't hear it and I was likesometimes when you just hear things inStereo you don't hear because you justwant to hear your own truth so I'mactually we're going to go off scripturea little bit please how did you getbetter at hearing feedback that youdidn't necessarily want to hear becauseI think there's always a little bit ofcognitive dissonance oh yeahum failure honestly like I wish theywould talk about that a little bit likeI wish there was a shortcut I mean myfirst uh my first company we uhso I was in early stage I was likeemployee number nine in a company and uhwescaled really really quickly and one ofthe things that I didn't douh was I was given I was given a lot oflike early signals about hey you know wereally need to think about themanufacturing like how we're going toscale out manufacturing this this was uhthis was the satellite lbn transceiverthing that I was talking about earlierand you know I kept I kept thinkingabout like you know we'll be able tosolve that problem we'll be able tosolve that problem the value wassomewhere else I kept getting a lot ofadvice that actually no you really needto think about this from people who knewand uh it turned out that we had apretty catastrophic event where uh ourmanufacturing quality went down and ohby the way like it turned out that youknow Lessons Learned hard are the bestuh I Iat some point in the future I wasactually pressure tested so the pressureseals failed and that's not really goodwhen you're taking l-band satellitetransceivers and you're putting them onaircraft you're putting them on otherthings like pressure is a big deal oopsand uh so to teach me a lesson like Iwent and I had to go like manually testpressure seals for like a month or twoand figure out how to do it well and uhyou know it's a small trivial examplebut I I think you probably uh my guessis on any given day any given week youbump into a scenario whereum you know you've kind of taken a hiton something and maybe just encourageyou to take a step back and kind of lookfor root cause and see if there'sactually a time when someone was tryingto coach you away from that decision weusually don't take the second step weusually just analyze the problem asengineers and then like find thesolution but actually finding the sourcemaybe of the Tremors that could havetipped you offum that's actually a lot of what we doin the CTO office now because we getstuff wrong all the time we we take onyou know 10 20 projects a year and willfail in six or seven of them but youknow it's as applicable in a small groupof Engineers inside a big company as itis to you know startups trying to Ithink I think you know trying to figureout how to like increase the learningrateum but you know go to the source like doa real root cause but on the people sidenot on the engineering side and you maydiscover that there are some people inyour org you need to listen to a littlebit more or there are some peopleoutside of your orgy you need to hireyeah no that's a really great reflectionso thank you for sharing all rightpainful exactly sorry to bring you backall about pressure by the way if anybodywants to talk I know all about themright fair enoughso let's talk about scale a little bithopefully this group is at a phase inyour companies where you're now scalingwhat are some lessons learned things tothink about and when working with GoogleCloud specifically what are some thekind of advice you've been giving out tocompanies as they've been scaling uhsure uh soit sneaks up on you has been myexperienceI'd love to say perfect planning youknow and I've always had great foresightin a crystal ball but usually there'ssome event that happens or some triggerthat happens it's exogenous it's hard topredict with you know because you're theexpert in your area and you're theexpert in you know the use case in thedomain that you deal with so there'susually like these things that happenand all of a sudden you've got to dealwith kind of the success disaster so Idon't thinkI try to be very pragmatic in how Ispend my time and one of the places Ihaven't spent my time enough in over theyears is in building relationships andPartnerships when I didn't need themand so when you're rapidly trying toscale what you find is you're going toneed help with that usually and so themore that you can get out and find kindof like communities for you know thingsthat you might anticipate you would needfor scale so if some of you are stilldoing like lots of stuff on-prem andyou're just starting out into Cloud youknow there's communities that exist bothlike within the startup Community butalso like there are some communitiesthat exist for successful you knowFounders that have moved to cloud andthere's some best practices there thatyou can take advantage of you knowalmost like networking ahead of thecurrent demand is one thing that mightbe useful for you uh the leadership teamcomposition is a really big dealuh and I mean this is an area you're youknow World expert in my you know twocents isthinking about the construction of theleadership team for scale because youwant to give people some time to getsome reps in your business before youneed them to go out and represent yourbusiness on a much bigger scaleum so uh I think of like great pairs youknow like pair programming Works in myexperience while it also works is likefind your pair so if you're like atechnical founder find your uh find yourCherylyou know like find your Safra you knowfind your you know Eric uh you knowthese are all business people thatappended themselves earlier on you knowto a business uh to a technical founderand the pair really created some magicand so really thinking about thatorchestration before you need it becauseyou and the Cheryl and the Safra andEric's they also need to understand thebusiness before they can help you scaleand that learning curve takes some timeand we often underestimate like one ofthe big failure modes is going to hireexternally for scale they don'tunderstand your business they haven'thad the time to understand the technicalfoundations and so then when they go torepresent like the value you create orthe business model they're not actuallycreating leverage for you they'recreating more work for you because youhave to go and Loop behind them and thengo explain all the things rightuh so that's a couple of couple ofthoughts yeah no it's great it soundslike a lot of it is you know but I keephearing you refer to as the team and thepeople that you surround yourself withbecause you just you don't know exactlywhich direction anything is going to goso if you have the right balance thereso I want to switch gears again now andtalk about AI because that is front andcenter in case you haven't caught up onthat here at next and everywhere in theworld every day so what are you seeingright now with the companies that you'reworking with at octo and with all of thecommunities of startups and I know whatare some like two or three insights thatyou think they're particularly relevantfor this group sure uh one isdepending on where you sit in like theAI value creation chain you know likesome people are building models somepeople are wrapping services around wellso it doesn't just have to be a productoriented company it could be a serviceoriented company that's really you knowand they're examples of companieskilling it right now you know on what Icall like the ends of the spectrum sofrom like you know building the modelsthemselves all the way out to likeProfessional Services wrapped around youknow a specific use case specificindustry or specific segment there are alot of different paths to success and uhI would say probably two to three yearsago gcp was really really capable forkind of theum like you need an Ops platform that'llsmooth out some of like uh you know itwouldn't necessarily create some of theintellectual property advantage on themodel side but it was a really goodplace to start and experiment and startto learn how to like actually deploy MLon a consistent basis with ML apps butit's very generic whereas today like twoyou know over the last two or threeyears if you want to build if yourbusiness model is you want todifferentiate on the model I mean youcan use raw compute through gke and youknow you can tune for you know tpus gpusand you can get some pretty amazingscale very quickly I mean companies likeanthropic AI 21 others who have reallyyou know are pushing us but they'resucceeding and they're you know likethey're able to train very very quicklyand they're also helping instruct us onwhat we ought to do around like mlfungibility so being able to just deploya workload and whether and you know letus take care of the heavy lifting ofmapping that to what type of process orwhat type of execution environment sothat's certainly that's certainly onemessage is that wherever you sit on likekind of where you're creating valuethere's an entry pointum I think the probably the second thingthat is interesting to all of you is ormay be interesting to all of you isthere's also a lot of people now thatthat have created enough patterns foryou to kind of find similarity withso we have the AI you know people thathave built models we have the folks whoare creating their own platforms andusing components of gcp to create likeml platforms within their own companiesum we even have digital natives thathave succeeded on gcp so they have areal firm sense of like you know how youdo generative AI well while keeping itsecure and keeping it private using vpcsand service controls and all the likeyou know cloudy patterns that all of youprobably think are just you know obviousright but have been a really bigchallenge for big companies there areenough digital natives now that haveplowed background that these patternsexist I was talking to some of youbefore this I think one of the bigchallenges for us is to make them moreobviousand easier to get to and faster to movefrom like I have a question of how to dothis to how to deploy or how to consumeorum you know how to orchestrate and sothat's you know that's learning for usbut I think in those two areas andthere's plenty for for you here yeah noI can imagine I mean the I agree that weprobably could do a better job ofdistilling the types of questions or atleast the common questions that arecoming in and that's actually one of thereasons that we have functions like thisbecause we're listening as much as weare sharing and as I should mention youprobably know this but we do have thesegenerative AI live and Labs eventsaround the country so if you look at ourwebsite you can see when some of thoseare happening and if it's appropriateyou can go there and meet with some ofour customer Engineers or some membersof our team to go deeper into some realkind of specific technical use casesthere and that's also part of why wehave the AI startups program so thatthere's again these peer groups you saidthat are really critical yeah like ifyou're generating you know marketingcontent for example like you should talkto canva and if you're doing it acrossmultiple languages or geographies likethey're an awesome company who's figuredout how to use gcp to take like contentand you know translate it super fast andsuper efficiently that's what I mean bylike there are companies in almost likeevery segment or every problem space isa question of just like I thinksurfacing it and also being willing toshare what you're really after one ofthe things that we see a lot in ourearly work with especially smallcompanies is perception that like youknow we're going to share with yousomething very very sensitive about ourbusiness about how we want to createvalue and then like Google's going totake that and you know do something withit the truth is like we succeed as amulti-tenant platform at scale and youknow consumption of compute is like thedeal for us and so we're not going toextend into a whole bunch of likebespoke software and bespoke-likeJourneys because that is fragile andit's not a good business for us so it'sokay don't be afraid please like sharewhat you're actually trying toaccomplish so that we don't like laystupid templates on top of what you'retrying to do and you're like oh it wassuch a waste of time I feel like we justspent six meetings with Google and wedidn't get like anything useful liketell us how you're trying to createvalue and uh the companies that are youknow on the reference list they've allyou know kind of come to that placewhere they're now sharing very openlylike their problems with xla and some ofthe things that sit underneath the hoodof like optimizing performance on us andas a result like stuff's getting putinto the roadmap and getting done yeahso that gets right into what my lastquestion was going to be and then Ithink we have time for a few questionsfrom this group so if you want to belike thinking about anything that you'dlike to ask well I'm also happy toanswer anything as wellso in terms of staying ahead of thecurve so one of the ways that you'vesaid is share openly as much as you feelcomfortable obviously so that we canhelp you anything else any other advicefor this groupoh let's seeum well I mean I should be gettingadvice from all of you because you'rebuilding the futureummaybe a couple of things onespeed is your allyone of the things I bump into a lot thattakes speed away is trying to do toomany thingsum it may seem counterintuitive but likedoing and this is like the always theyou know it's like this is in every bookright or every picture every like youknow coaching you've probably gone fromany investor is like do this thing do itreally well do it really fast and I'mjust gonna say it too do one thing do itreally well and do it really fastbecause we've seen some companiesbecause generative AI is is kind ofspinning so quickly what's happening isthere's like this shock wave andcompanies think that they have to likepivot to the newest like approach orthing and what it does is it slows youdownum so I would argue that sometimes it'scounterintuitive but you may have to putthe blinders on a little bit to all oflike the fast spinning you know goocoming at you and kind of stick to yourguns and try to create kind of linkedvalues so that you know what you'rebuilding and how you're taking it toMarket and the operations that'ssupported and the people that you hireall those things matchbecause uh a classic example of this iswhen a company tells me they're aproduct based company and then they'redoing a bunch of Professional Servicesengagements because they believe thatthat's the only way to keep theircompany alive and so they hire a bunchof Professional Servicesand they don't ever get to the productbitand they get valued in on ProfessionalServices and that's not what they wantedlisten I I services companies areawesome businesses to be they areawesome but you've got to have the rightlike business processes Talent likevalue proposition to match it and pulltechnology you need to actually makethat happen and not too much if you're aproduct company like which part are youtrying to optimize and I think thatthat's one of the the goods like we putout so much at one time but it's alsoone of the risks is that there's so muchthat it's easy to get distracted and tryto do too many things foreign"
