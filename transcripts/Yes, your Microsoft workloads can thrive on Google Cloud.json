and I'm joined today byvenka gautamnenney who leads productmanagement for all key Enterpriseworkloads including Microsoft EnterpriseLinux sap and others we're also thrilledto be joined by representatives from twoof our most prominent customersAugustine carabao from saber and Brentonsalati from Wayfairso here's a quick overview of the agendafor today's session I'm going to startwith a brief overview of the productsolutions for Microsoft workloads on gcpand then I'll hand it off to Augustineand to Brenton who will share more aboutthe cloud Journeys for their respectiveorganizationsthen we'll finish with a few key productannouncements and you know we expectthat there will be a little bit of timeat the end and we'd be happy to stickaround and do a little bit of an offlineq a so feel free to kind of come up tothe front and chat us up happy to talkso yeah with that let's get startedso as you can see from this timeline ofkey product launches Google cloud hasmade a long-term commitment to ensuringa first-class experience for Microsoftworkloads running on our platformthat commitment is deep and ongoing andwe're excited to demonstrate it furtherwith a few key product announcementsthat we'll make later in the sessionwe think there are three primary reasonswhy customers choose Google Cloud fortheir Microsoft workfirst and foremost is the solidfoundation provided by our world-classinfrastructure that's secure by Designreliable and delivers exceptional priceperformance for any customer workloadnot not only Microsoft with respect toMicrosoft specifically we have a coupleof differentiated features that I'd liketo call out that enable our customers tostreamline their cpu-based license costsand optimize price performance the firstis custom VMS which enable customers tofabricate machine shapes that areperfectly tailored to their workloadcharacteristicsand and the second is our sole tenantnode offering which enables customers toover commit the host CPU by up to 100effectively doubling the VM capacity ofeach hostthe second reason is the flexibility ofour offering enabling customers to bringtheir Microsoft workloads to gcp as theyare and to further optimize andmodernize those workloads once they landon our platformwe support the migration of VMS runningend-of-life versions of Windows and alsoprovide customer support for Microsoftworkload issues with Enterprise gradeslasfinally we strongly believe that Googlecloud is the best platform formodernizing any Legacy Enterprise Techstack including Microsoft thanks to ourMarket leading capabilities and AI dataanalytics containerized workloads andour robust portfolio of managed servicesI'd also like to call out that we have abroad range of solutions for vdi and Dasworkloads thanks to our partners who areall leaders in the industry againflexibility and customer choice is astrength of our offering here if youalready have a deep partnership with avdi provider we support vdi workloadmigrations that leverage customersexisting vendor contracts or if you'rejust getting started our Marketplacemakes it easy to sign up and work withthe partner of your choiceif you'd like to learn more I believeall these Partners listed on the slideare present at next so please seek themout they'll be happy to connect with youwe have thousands of customers runningtheir business critical workloads on theplatform today and later in this sessionyou'll hear from two of the largest onesWayfair and saber and learn more abouthow they've successfully migratedoptimized and transformed their on-premworkloads with Google Cloudforeignaddition to customers IDC is alsorecognized Google Cloud as an idealplatform for operating and modernizingwindows server-based applicationsciting our flexible licensing modelssimple and transparent pricing structureand optimization features as keydifferentiators the report is availableonline and I encourage you all to checkit out if you're interested in learningmorenow this diagram illustrates the highlevel Journey that most windows and SQLserver-based applications follow fromthe on-prem world to Cloud native and Ithink it nicely frames some of the TheAmazing Stories That Augustine andBrinson are about to share with usthe Enterprise Cloud Journey typicallybegins with a lift and shift of theon-prem workload with minimalmodifications to the workload in thisinitial phase a flexible offering is keyto successful lift and shift migrationsand you'll hear as you'll hear from theexperience of Augustine and the saberteamonce landed on gcp we have a robust setof features that enable customers tofine-tune price performance of theirworkloads for the cloud environment andagain saber provides a great example ofhow this is done in practicewhile there's a lot to be gained fromthe lift shift optimized journey of alegacy Enterprise workload customers canunlock far greater long-term value bytransforming these workloads accordingto Cloud native best practices and byleveraging gcp's market leading servicesfor building and operating Cloud nativeapplications as you'll soon hear saberand Wayfair have both made great stridesin this directionand with that I will hand the mic off toour customers starting with Augustineand then Brenton[Music]awesome thank you Brendan thank you forthis side thank you Clark thank you verymuch so as Brenda was saying so I'm hereI'll my name is Agustin caravallo I'm anSRE leader at saver and I'm going toconnect it a bit with how saver whatsaver does as well as our journey intothe cloud and actually connected withwhat Brandon was describing us as ourlift and shift approach and thenoptimizing the platform as we moveforward so with that let me let me getstartedso I'd say where we are in the businessof travel we partnered with Airlineshoteliers agencies and other travelPartners to retail distribute andfulfill travel every day millions ofpeople interact with our platform weEmpower everything from Airport check-inkiosk where you check in to get intoyour flight online travel sites likeExpedia booking.com would help themprovide their content as well as earlyin a hotel reservations networkstravelation Terminals and many otherSolutions we are positioned right in thecenter of the vision of travel and wehelp our customers connect with peopleand provide customized solutions forthem as well as Drive revenue andoperate more efficientlyand the unit that I'm going to tell youtoday which is saver Hospitality unitwithin server is actually the unit thathelps and provide technology for ourhotel years and customers we areactually one of the leading technologyproviders in the industry serving hotelsuh chains and their and resorts for theretailing distribution and fulfillmentneeds we help them offer rooms andservices through multiple differentchannels including as I mentioned onlinetravel agency Java distribution systemdirect channels and others our platformis a large-scale system that ensuresthat availability and race I quicklyupdated across many different partnersand then allows customers or travelersto actually shop and book those daysonce the reservation is done we alsoprovide our hotels with the technologyto fulfill that state by providing toolsthat allows them to manage theirproperties so in this scenario one usecase that we we actually leverage fromgcp and we'll dive in in a bit more indetail is when a hotel wants to change araid or wants to change the price forthe room considering a hotel having manyrooms with many arrays associated withthose hotels and then translating orextrapolate into a change made at thechain level where many hotels need tochange their uh their rate for manyrooms that can generate quickly millionsand millions of messages that we thenneed to synchronize with our partnersonline partnerssome of that is what we actually wereable to leverage and I will jump intothe details but we'll leverage with gcpto actually scale our infrastructure tosupport that that level of messagessynchronized with our partners and thenscale it down when we don't need itso overall chances are that if you're abook a room online you interacted withyour hotel check into your hotel you'reusing our technology in the backgroundcurrently we operate our hotel helperhotels and travelers around 200countries around the world we actuallyhave 40 of the world leading HotelBrands trusting saver and we arecovering or operating with 50 000 hotelsacross the world and our infrastructurehelped us achieve 11 million shoppingrequests per month to sell their contentso I'll dive a little bit more into theactual migration the story of themigration into gcp so as part of ourdesire to to grow and provide a bettersolution for our customers we actuallypartnered with Google to migrate ouron-prem environment into the cloudfor animation migration Target our ourgoal was really to eliminate ourdependency with our on-prem data centeralso distribute our infrastructureacross the world whatever our customersneeded to be running on as well as scaleout quickly and scale down when we don'tneed itthe overall migration on carover wasdesigned to minimize the architecturalchanges on our platform for our firstphase targeting an initial lift andsheets approach again connected withClark was mentioned in initially rightpart of that left cycle quadrant weapproach it that way and the additionalgoal was to complete this migration inunder a yearwithout our initial uh online regioncame in 2021 in the in in Europe andthen our two remain in U.S regions cameonline in September 2022.the Reiner migration we actually rely onmany different components to make thishappenand we utilize many differentTechnologies within the gcpinfrastructure a few words mentioning sothere are part of our migration asmentioned we are mainly a Windows orMicrosoft shop with over 7 000um compute instances to supporteverything from our all our applicationstag everything from front end to ourbackend and some of our bad shopprocessingin order to migrate this we actually usea gcp Google compute engine in order tomigrate our infrastructure as it was andagain support the running our.netapplication stack and again this allowsus to minimize the changes required forthe stack and allows us to do thismigration in the in the in the time slotthat was requiredanother part of the technology or theapplication stack that we actuallyLeverage is we use bare metal solutionto allow us to continue to use our largelarge Oracle run transactional databasethis again allows us to keep the sameperformance keep the same throughputthat we have on the existing data centerwithout having to introduce massivechanges to our application stackand lastly in that in that area we alsomigrated from our SQL Serverinfrastructure that's used for reportingand analytics over to Cloud SQL andleverage that solution as I mentionedlike by doing this we we keep our dataherealmost with no changes minimizing anychanges to our application stack andthen lastly one area that we did make adecision to to improve or or change uhis essentially migrating from ourMicrosoft mq and active NQinfrastructure that was used to againsynchronize messages over to ourpartners and we migrated to Pub sub thisactually helped us to empower processingover 35 million messages daily andactually not how to scale up or down ourmessages tier again relying on Pub suband only scale up our our workerswithout.net stackagain just like any migration we runinto some issuesum some of those we we got over with thesupport of our gcp Engineers I mentionedtoo that were worth mentioning so one isas being a Windows shop our Windowsinfrastructure we were looking to beable to scale our our infrastructureindependently on iteration so as part ofthat we actually set up a multi-regionactive directory infrastructure alongwith that we configure our instances touse adjoin to successfully join thedomain when new instances are coming upwhether it's for a deployment or whetherit is for scaling up and with that weaccomplished or we were able to to meetour requirements which were being ableto register over 300 instances perminute on ID on the local ID on the onthe specific region which allows us toimplement the blue green deploymentapproach to essentially bring up onestack bring down the other andessentially move traffic aroundthe other bar was was really morecloud-based challenge which was we movedfrom our on-prem data center with an F5load balancing solution to actuallyusing gcp load balance and as part ofthat we collaborated with our gcpEngineers to create a health checkhierarchy to allow different levels ofof checks on our instances to ensurethat if an instance were saturated ornot ready to take traffic the loadbalancer to take it down out of the loadbalancer as well as if the instance wasnot healthy it will be terminated andrecreated but again those are two of thechallenges that we encounter as we weremigrating and then lastly someimprovements that we continue toimplement and did this place this placeback to the slider Clark presented so weare actually looking to implement Soultenant in our us-based regions toactually reutilize or utilize ourexisting license license agreement formicro of products and be able to reduceour Windows license costs which againdefinitely be given the the scale it isthe large part of the cost of runningour infrastructure and then similarly tothat and it was also on the previousslides we're looking for the specificareas where smt or simultaneousmulti-threading can be disabled on onworkloads that do not require parallelprocesses in processing and are serialin nature and those also looking todecrease our Windows license costand then lastly just to to wrap it up Iwanted to tell a few benefits that weare getting after we migrated so when itcomes to thatpart of the migration to gcp one of thecritical reasons to migrate to Cloud wasreally our desire to run ourinfrastructure across the world whateverour customers require us to run so aspart of that migrationare for migration we were able todistribute our infrastructure asmentioned in Europe as well as inmultiple regions in North America andthat actually enabled us to respond tocustomer demand for local solutions thatcomply with local data regulationsreduce response time as well as withoutincreasing our total cost of ownershipin the processas we onboard new customers we actuallysaw a significant reduction of oureffort to set up new infrastructureand supporting the growth of existingcustomersoverall the time to bring a new customerinto our platform with a specific or adedicated stack is required decreased by70 on existing locations and even moreso in locations where we didn't have adata center prior to our migrationanother side effect as well is our costto perform and support our DisasterRecovery infrastructure dramaticallydecrease essentially being able to spinup our VR infrastructure when if adisaster occurs or for for specificsituationsand then lastly from a benefitperspective from our securityperspective the again and and talkingback to the the windows side we werealso able to significantly reduce thethe effort to patch our entireinfrastructure and this was really byleveraging our CI CD Pipeline andincorporating or making our gold imageswith the latest patches go through ournormal CI CD pipeline so when they arecreating a new stock when they aredeploying a new stack those servers arealready the latest security patches andagain that reduced the overall effort toto support our environment and thenlastly again going back to the previousuh slide that Clark presented as wecontinue to optimize continue to lookfor additionaltools to leverage on the on the gcpenvironment we are looking at differentthings including RPG to perform our APImanagement API Gateway as well as lookaround Google data studio for Analyticsum and with that let me pass it toBrendan thank youall rightum so hi everyone my name is Brentonsaladi I am a product director atWayfair and I lead a collection ofback-end technology teams focused on ourcatalog pricing and supplier platforms Ialso lead the machine learning and dataengineering teams that support thosespaces and I'm excited to chat with youtoday about some work that Wayfair isdoing specifically on transformation ofsome of our Cloud our Cloud operationsum so I'm a product guy you might bewondering why I'm here talking about howto run SQL server in the cloud butreally this has tremendous leverage forwayfair's business and so I'm going tostart with what I'd like you to get outof the spotlight the first is I want togive you a high level understanding ofwayfair's business and especially thecritical role that differentiatedmerchandising plays for our Enterprisestrategysecond I'm going to show you how Wayfairhas been running Microsoft SQL workloadsthat are critical to that differentiatedstrategy in gcp since 2021 reallysmoothly at really high scaleand then finally I'm going to talk aboutthe next generation of wayfair's dynamicmerchandising technology and how gcp isgoing to both power that and also enableincremental migration from the LegacyMicrosoft SQL workloadsso a bit about Wayfair for folks thatmight not be familiar we specialize inthe Home Goods category which is aboutan 800 billion dollar market globallythere's a very broad set of productsthat constitute that market and Wayfairwas about 12 and a half billion inRevenue in 2022 so we're at fairly largescale but we have a lot of room to growinto that full Market opportunity wehave about 20 000 employees spreadacross North America Europe and Indiaand the goal of all those employees isto bring together products across tensof thousands of suppliers to help tensof millions of customers have a curatedretail experience to find those greatproducts they're going to make theirhome one that they love and can livetheir best life in we specialize inlarge heavy fragile items that's a corepart of our category we actually have aproprietary large parcel LogisticsNetwork that handles everything fromcontainer forwarding from China to lastmile delivery and white gloveinstallation in the customer's home thisis all powered by a set of Technologyteams that are building proprietarysoftware to really lean in into thecomplexities inherent to our businessmodel into our Market to create durabledifferentiation for Wayfair that's goingto help us grow to really be a marketleader in this really large spaceso at the core of wayfair's business isthis catalog of over 50 million uniquelive products and we want to merchandisethose products across a variety ofdifferent merchandising experiences wedon't just want to offer the sameproductum you know to the same customer in aone-size-fits all we really want totailor the product offering to differentsub-segments of consumers and so whatthat looks like is in addition to theWayfair brand we have four strategicretail Brands Paragould all modern Etcwe merchandise those products acrossfive different countries six differentlanguages two different segments soabout 15 percent of wafeter's Revenuewere almost two billion dollars isspecific to B2B and now we also havephysical retail stores we've launched Ibelieve four or so stores and we'regoing to be launching more and so Omnichannel is going to be a core part ofwhat our catalog has to supportnot only do we take a single product andchoose how we curate that selectionacross all those various merchandisinginstances we have to also differentiatethe merchandising experience it's notenough to have a product that a customercan look at side by side and see thatthese are actually the same thing wewant a product that is in Kelly Clarksonhome on Wayfair to look meaningfullydifferent from the all-modern site andso we have to differentiate themerchandising data as part of creatingthose great experiences for customersum this is for another presentation butI just also want to call out that that50 million product catalog is actuallytremendously diverse and it would havethings that you might expect like arearugs and upholstered furniture we alsohave things like lawn gnomes andmulti-thousand dollar chandeliers soeven within the catalog if you take awayall that merchandising complexity ofsharing you know differentdifferentiated data and experiences justthe vast variety of product types andhow we optimally merchandise those isanother large problem and I just wantedan excuse to get a lawn gnome and achandelier on the slide so I'll stopthat digression nowso supporting our differentiatedmerchandising capability today is a 10year old system that we call Brandcatalog and this is built on proprietaryMicrosoft SQL Server functionality thatI'll talk more about shortly but inessence this provides a lot of technicaljobs to be done for internal teams datastorage data triggering data sharing theability to efficiently you know extenddata where you need it but to have afallback where you don't and as a resultover 10 years and because of thatcritical nature of this technologythere's a massive footprint of thisthroughout our Enterprise so hundreds ofterabytes of data tens of thousands ofcode-based references trillions Ttrillions of monthly reads and thenhundreds of billions of monthly rightswhen we migrated this to uh you knowGoogle cloud in 2021 we knew it wasn'tgoing to be possible to actuallytransform this workload you really needa cloud-native environment to do thethings we'd want to do so lift and shifthad to be feasible and it couldn't justwork in theory it had to work inpractice and so you know we've reallyhad a tremendous experience in gcp beingable to run this workload and actuallygrow it since we lifted and shifted in2021 so this has all been running in gcpfor several years nowso now I'm going to do a little primeron how brand catalogs work they are aunique combination of a brand a countryand a language so for example if you hada Wayfair U.S English that could be yourmain brand catalog brand catalog oneWayfair Canada French might be brandcatalog 2. importantly those threedimensions always have to go togetherthey're not independently decomposableunder the hood the way that we Implementthat is by taking a master table say asimple you know product table for theWayfair U.S English catalog which has astock keeping Unit A SKU one two threefour and it's a living room with a linensofa bed we now want to merchandise thatproduct in Canada which needs to haveboth English and French variations of inthis case product name but you canimagine many other different dataelements so what we would do here is wewould apply a globalization functionthat creates a remote record from thatmaster table that allows us to holddifferent values by different brandcatalog different brand catalog recordsso in this instance the Wayfair CanadaEnglish record can have a null valuebecause I don't want differentiationit'll automatically fall back to theWayfair us catalog where I do wantdifferentiation for the Wayfair CanadaFrench version I can now add thattailored data and that's what I'll showto the customer so there's some reallynice properties with this where if youdon't want differentiation null valuesgive you a single source of Truth stillwhere you do want variation you can addthatforeignso that all sounded pretty good right sowhy are we replacing it what are theproblemsum so brand catalog actually is kind ofreaching a point where it's 10 yearshave been very successful but forWayfair to unlock the next 10 years ofgrowth the next 10 years of expansionand really to grow into that full tan weneed an alternative solutionum the first problem with brand catalogand the biggest one frankly is that itblocks migration of data tonon-microsoft SQL databases in a cloudnative architecture you have to be ableto take data isolate it buildapplications around it but what do youdo and so much of your coremerchandising data is locked into sharedtables that back-end clients don't knowwhat to do with that data how would Irecreate what brand catalog gives metoday so we have to have alternatefunctionality to really enable that fullyou know distributed distributedServices architecture that we envisionsecond is that it doesn't have greatsupport for large existing segments ofthe business like B2B you might havenoticed that store country languagedoesn't include B2B so again we've got amulti-billion dollar B2B business itdeserves first class support as part ofour future our future State architectureum it's inefficient at handlingmulti-language countries a lot of youare really smart I'm sure you'veconnected the fact that we probably needto have two brand catalogs for Canadaone for French one for English if youthink about future European expansionthere's many multi-language countries soagain this is going to become moreproblematic it's inefficient atsupporting omnichannel again we can workaround it but you have to startoverloading the concepts of what it wasdesigned for and then finally we're atabout 25 brand catalogs today just thesheer number of brand catalogs thatbecome the standards by which you managemerchandising becomes unwieldy imaginechanging the way that lawn gnomes aremerchandised not just once but 25 timesacross all the different brand catalogswhere we merchandise lawn gnomes so forall these reasons brand catalog hasreally served us well but we have to dosomething different for the futurethat future is called the market contextum so that's the solution that willpower the next generation of dynamicmerchandising for Wayfair and will giveus the extensibility we need for thefuture so two key things here one marketcontext will support all the dimensionsof nuance that we need for the businessso going Beyond just brand country andlanguage but also to channel and segmentthis is extensible or so we can add NewDimensions if we want to we can addadditional parameters within dimensionsand these are going to be independentlyusable so clients will be able tospecify the dimensions that you want tocare about they won't have to understandthat you know brand catalog number X youknowAssociates to some specific specific setof context conditions it's alsobackwards compatible so because Marketcontext supports uh store brand countryand language if we already have a brandcatalog supporting that market contextcan give the client the same payload ofcourse when we're talking aboutEnterprise level migrations if you don'thave backwards compatible compatibilityyou really don't have a viable solutionand Market context is not going to be amonolithic Mega platform it's going tobe a a way of standardizing conceptualdimensions of variation formerchandising and a way that allowsteams to decide what components theywant to use on the back end to implementthose requirements so it's going toenable distributed ownership of these ofthese tremendously flexible dimensionsof variationum and then like I said lastly it'sgoing to enable Wayfair to more broadlytransform its Tech stack to be fullyCloud modernso let's do a quick use case and walkthrough an example so imagine that wewant to have a shortened product namefor a physical retail store in FrenchCanadaso again shortened name we have anelectronic shelf level label there'slimited space and so we want somethingthat's going to give us that payloadback so in this instance we'd say aninternal client let's say it's ainternal physical retail service wouldmake a call to our Federated Gateway theFederated Gateway is going to understandMarket context and it's going to resolvethat to the underlying subgraphs or subservices that need to fulfill thatclient's request in this case it wouldgo to the the naming subgraph the namingsubgraph is going to have under the hooda set of components that they've used toimplement Market context they'll beusing a market context Dimensionsmanagement solution but beyond that theway that they Implement things liketranslation workflowsyou know calling out to internalplatforms or third-party services all ofthat will be up to them to manage rightand we'll give them some guidelines Butultimately they can drive animplementation as long as it meets themarket context requirements they're freeto do what they want and so then whatcomes back is a nice new wants productname in both French and English for thatelectronic shelf label and so a couplethings to call out here that are reallypowerful one the client has an intuitivesemantic way to specify the Nuance thatthey want they don't have to specify abrand catalog ID they just say I havethis this store this country thischannel these languages give me what Iwantsecond by decoupling the clientsemantics from the backend data storagethe backend teams now have thatflexibility to develop whatever theywant in a way that meets the client'srequirements while abstracting them fromthe complexities of the implementationdetails and in turn this is going toallow us to you know dramaticallyimprove our velocity while allowingclients to have a simplified experienceyou can imagine too that you know withthe Advent of gen Ai and machinelearning this is very conducive tohaving ml models up you know optimizeover time the various differentiationlevers that market context offers atscale so we're really excited for whatthe future holds for this for thissolutionum Market context is fundamentallypowered by Cloud native capabilitiesthat are powered by gcp I'm not going togo through all of the different parts ofthe solution that we're using on theright hand side but I'm just going tocall out a couple of key highlights hereCloud native databases are critical forenabling data owners to manage thestorage and management of their dataGoogle's interoperability means that wecan essentially create sdks that allowinternal teams to set up thosecomponents to have you know performanceand cost and operational excellencebuilt into it to treat data as a firstclass product requirement to haveintegration with bigquery and analyticsand Reportingum so for all those reasons we're ableto ensure that teams don't just stand upwhat they need operationally but they doit in a way that's going to plug intothe rest of the Google Cloud suite andreally make a full offering out of thebox of course we're using a lot of eventdriven Integrations between systems suchas Cloud run and functions to processtasks tasks at scale we're eliminatinguse of slowly changing Dimensions tablesand fire and forget background jobs andand then lastly with this distributedarchitecture it's critical that we havelogging and monitoring for operationalexcellence because if something goeswrong you need to know where it's goingwrong who's responsible you have to youhave to react to that very quicklyespecially for a critical tier onesystem like this you know the monitoringcapabilities will ensure that not onlyis this distributed and orchestrated butthere's operational excellence backingthat upum so this one all happened overnightthis will be a multi-year journey and sowith Google Cloud we're able to both runthe Legacy brand catalog workload andSQL Server we're able to editablydevelop new components of functionalityfor Market context and to migrate teamsthere over time uh and so you knowreallyum can't speak highly enough for howwe've really benefited from theflexibility of gcp and are reallyexcited for how it's going to powerwayfares next 10 years of merchandisingexcellenceand with that I'm going to hand thingsback to Clark to take us home[Applause]all right thanks thanks Brenton andAugustineum yeah so I'm gonna wrap things up herewith a few product announcements thatworks I just share the first is Generalavailability of new Microsoft licenseassessment capabilities for migratingcustomers there are two places where weare servicing these new capabilitiesfirst is in our Cloud spend estimatorwhich customers can use during migrationplanning to generate TCO estimates thatproperly account for Microsoft licensingand identify the licensing model that isbest for their use casefor customers that have utilized ourstratasone solution to scan theiron-prem environments we've also added aMicrosoft license assessment report tothe stratosome portal which enablescustomers to review Microsoft licensingaware of TCO estimates based on theon-prem data that we've collected viastratazoneso those are available nownext we're excited to announce previewavailability of workload manager for SQLServer earlier this year we announcedGeneral availability of workload managerfor sap a SAS solution that scans sapdeployments validates theirconfigurations against known bestpractices and surfaces potentialsecurity and reliability issues as wellas opportunities to optimize at the endof this week we will extend workloadmanager to validate SQL serverdeployments on gcp in the same fashionas sap we're also actively seekingpreview customers so if you were youknow interested in trying this out youknow please reach out we'd love to toconnectand last but not least we have Googlecloud NetApp volumes this this wasactually formally announced last weekbut just wanted to re to uh you know togive it a shout here as well because Ithink it there's a couple of featuresthat I think are particularly relevantfor for the Microsoft audience uh so ifyou're familiar with the NetApp offeringin gcp Marketplace you know that it wasa close collaboration between Google andNetApp But ultimately for the customerit involved to interacting with twoseparate companiesGoogle Cloud NetApp volumes is a is atrue native Google product customershave a single point of contact for salesbilling procurement and supportum it's uh you can provision it usingthe API as well as the console it usesthe same access management uhcapabilities as any gcp native serviceso it is truly like from a functionalstandpoint it behaves just like a nativesort of first-party gcp servicethe other thing I would want to call outfor for this audience in particular isthat with the addition of Google cloudand app volumesum you know gcp now for the first timehas a a fully managed SMB storageoffering for Windows workloadsall right so there's a couple of usecases we think that that will you knowthat that'll light up for us uh you knowfirst is you know file sharing for vdiusers as well as a shared storage layerfor clustered SQL Server deployments"
