rameshner and I'm aproduct manager on Google Chat and I'mjoined today by my colleague Mikeremtula who's also a product manager onGoogle Chat and Sean winter who is SVPof strategy and customer experience atour partner lumapssowe'll be talking to to you today aboutintegrating with Google Chat to enablebetter collaboration for your customersGoogle workspace is where users spendtheir days communicating andcollaborating with their colleaguesand so it really makes sense to bringmore processes apps and tools into theplace where people are alreadycommunicating while collaboratingthe workspace team is building an openand extensible platform where alldevelopers and I.T professionals canbring your services your business dataand your critical processesall to where users are are already andso that customers can get the most valueout of all the tools they havethere are over 3 billion workspaceaccountsand 10 million paying customerorganizations for workspaceat Google Chat is a great place to startintegrating into this large ecosystemmany Enterprises just some of which areshown hererely on Google Chatto connect theirentire Workforceif you tuned into what's new with GoogleChat earlier todayyou'll know that we are making hugeinvestments into making Google Chat anexceptional product with over 40 newfeatures just this yearso it's a great time to build on GoogleChatin this session today I'll first walkyou through our chat app capabilitiesincluding some of the latest updatessome of the exciting new chat apps thatour partners have built as well as alittle bit about how you can build chatapps and get them distributed to usersand customersthen Mikewill talk to you about the new chat apishe'll share how we have launched new APIfeatures for chat that let you bringmany more workflows into chat includingcreating new spaces adding people tothose spaces and many moreMike will also be speaking with Seanfrom our partner lumaps about howthey've used the apis todayto benefit our shared customersfirst chat appsapps are a popular way for users tointegrate their favorite tools andservices into the communication platformthat they communicatedwe've been investing heavily in makingapps in Google Chat a great way to getwork donelet's start with some basic elements ifyou're not familiarchat apps can workas a direct message with a user allowingthat one-to-one communication or evenconversational interfacethey work in spaces so that you can havemultiplayer interactions with the wholeteamthey can read chat messages processevents display cards to show informationand many more thingsapps can also have other interactioncapabilities such as slash commands toallow users to quickly do a command witha few keystrokesor dialogues where users can enter inmore detailed information if they needtoand all these capabilities are availablenow and already enable great use casesfor your users and customersthere's also a significant amount of newcapability we've added in the last fewmonths as wellsome of the UI capabilities we'veincluded include the ability to havecolumns in cards so you can take moreinput and have more flexibility indisplaying information as demonstratedby the jira app hereand other highly requested feature isthe ability for apps to displayinformation just to a specific user sothey can get information that's specificto them or take action even if they'rein a big space with lots of teammatesdemonstrated by the Asana app herefinally apps can have a home page inchatthat you can use to show key informationsuch as ticket updates bug assignmentsor to-do listsall within chat so users don't have toleave their communication interface justto check on a quick statusthere are lots of other improvementscoming down the line so please join ourdeveloper preview program to learn aboutthem firstnow that we've covered some of theexciting capabilities that are availableand coming soon I did want to talk aminute about multiple develop optionsdevelopers haveto get started building chat appsappsheet is our no code Builder thatallows you to get an app up and runningwith no code using a graphical userinterfacewith duet AI for app sheet you can evenget an app running with a fewconversational promptsthose with a bit more coding experiencecan use apps script or low code languageand be able to create apps for hundredsof thousands of users even without yourowndevelopment environmentfinally for professional developers HTTPchat apps give you the most flexibilityand power allow you to reuse yourexisting infrastructure and scale tomillions of usersnext let's go through some examples ofPartners building great chat apps I seesome of you here today thank you forcomingbecause it's when you all build theseSolutions and use cases that the magichappens for our userswe're starting with some collaborationuse cases and a Google team looker havebuilta great integration with chat thatallows you to schedule send reportsdirectly to the right chat spacesand so the right users will be able tosee those reports when they're meant tonext up is collaboration partner Louwho allow you to bring context Richasync video messages straight into thechat streamso that users can collaborate in a truehybrid fashion across time zones andworking hoursthese Integrations are available nownext up let's look at the customersupport use casewe have the team from Zoho who arebuilding an integration with Zoho desktheir customer support softwarethis allows you to easily create assignand look up Zoho desk tickets right fromGoogle Chatsuch a great way for customer supportagents to collaborate with theirteammates and get more done andultimately help the End customerthe Zoho team is also building anintegration with their CRM software solook for that in the next few weekswe're also excited about a coupleIntegrations in the Human Resources usecaseso first is ukg who are building a toolthat streamlines workforce managementallowing Frontline workers and others toclock in swap schedules or look at theirschedules all from the mobile devicethat they may be using all within chatAchievers is a great platform thatallows users to recognize and celebratetheir colleagues and what better placeto celebrate your colleagues than acollaborative environment like GoogleChatthese apps are aiming to launch by endof year and we're very excited for thesetypes of use cases in an environmentlike Google Chatfinallygenerative AI partner typeface isintegrating across workspaceincluding an app for Google Chat thatallows you to generate new contentget feedback iterate and accelerateapprovals all within a chat spacethis type of integration is enablingproductivity and creativity at anexciting way and we're so excited to seethis and many others come to Google Chatwe've talked about some of thecapabilitiessome of the amazing apps that Partnershave builtnow let's talk about how users candiscover the apps you buildone example that you can see hereis that apps are now accessible rightfrom the compose barso that users can find your apps asthey're typing a message to theircolleagueswe're adding a new dedicated app sectionin Google Chat to elevate your apps andbring them into the same stream as yourDMs and your spaces with othercolleagueswe're excited that these and many otherproduct changes will helpElevate and make them even moreaccessible to usersin terms of opening up our audience I'mvery excited to share a key update thatjust launched last weekwhich is that consumer accounts or freegmail.com accounts can also use chatappsright from within Google Chatthis opens up a very large new audiencefor Developersand allows you opportunities to growyour customer base with a very largeaudienceworkspace admins at organizations arevery important stakeholders as welland as of earlier this yearadmins can now install thousands of appson behalf of their usersand so they can install it for an entireorganization particular organizationalunit or even specific groups thatthey've configuredso this is a great way to getdistribution as wellfinally another exciting updateis that chat apps in the next few weekswill be available for everyone to seeand install from from the Googleworkspace Marketplaceif you're familiar with the Googleworkspace Marketplace it's a great wayto get visibility to your apps and thereare featured categories such asrecommended for Google workspace and newcategories such as emerging apps orintelligent apps and we're lookingforward to featuring some of your appsin our Marketplacesowith those updates on capabilitiespartner Integrations and Discovery anddistribution of chat apps and I like topass it on to my colleague Mikegrimtulla to share more about chat apisand how you can build even more powerfulIntegrations using the apis thank you[Applause]thanks Ramesh and hey everyone thanksfor joining our sessionas I'm sure most of you are aware theoriginal chat API was very focused onuse cases mimicking those of a supportbot you know a very popular examplewould be a help desk bot that userscould ask questions to it and it wouldsimply answer those questionswhile this worked really well for thatsupport bot use caseit didn't meet all of the use cases thatour workspace developers are admins andour end users were asking forsome of these use cases including beingable to create a chat spaceprogrammatically or even read all of thechat messages in a space to be moreconversational with that userwhen we started designing the new chatAPI we wanted to make sure that weaddressed these top use cases and moreour overarching goal was to make surethat a chat app could do everything thatthe user could do in the chat web andmobile clientsI'm really excited to announce that wehave now launched a complete rest APIfor chat DevelopersI'm excited by it okayum developers now have full access totop level resources in chat spacesmemberships messages attachments andreactions you now have access to doeverything read and write all of thatdata right within chatquick pull to the audience how many ofyou watched my developer Spotlightsession in the Google workspaceDevelopers YouTube channeluh not very many okay well thank you forwatching it uh it looks like my dream ofbecoming a YouTube influencer is goingto be on hold but if for those of youwho did watch that YouTube video thiswill be very familiar to you there's afew key use cases that we targeted withsupporting these rest apis IncidentManagement is one of my favorites andwe've got a demo of that a little bitlater on as well but the mock showspagerduty creating a space and addingmembers to discuss a potential issuewe'll also be featuring IncidentManagement later on for those of you whoare able to stay and not rush to happyhouremployee onboarding is another key usecase that we wanted to support imaginewhen a new manager joins yourorganization in addition to creatingtheir email address creating a Googlegroup for them you can now create a chatspace for the team members provision andadd them to all of the relevant chatspaces that they need to be added toeven before they've joinedanother very important use case when wedesigned the chat apis was to supportreal-time message interoperability withslack and other Enterprise messagingplatforms if your organization usesmultiple messaging platforms you knowhow hard it is to make sure that all ofour users can find and talk to oneanother we don't want our users to be onan islandthis is a great opportunity to leteverybody know that tomorrow I'll betalking with Mio one of our partnersthat focuses on Enterprise messageinteroperabilityand we'll be announcing a customerthat's already in private preview withMiointeroping chat and slack together forall of their usersplease make sure you sign up for thatthat's in the Showcase theater tomorrowat 1 45 PM I believefinally one of the last use cases thatwe wanted to support with our new restapis was enabling migrations from Slackor other Enterprise messaging platformsinto chat and you see very importantbusiness data being discussed in chatspacethat slack channel is a knowledgerepository and there's so much importantinformation happening in that channelthat when you move some or all of yourusers into Google Chat we wanted to makesure that you didn't lose thatRepositoryone of the other partners that I'll betalking with tomorrow at the ShowcaseTheater will be Cloud fuse who's built aslack to chat migration tool and they'llalso be announcing a customer that'salready started migrating slack datainto Google Chatwe also have a very exciting roadmap forour developersRamesh already announced that as oftoday gmail.com users and guest accessspaces are supported through our restapis that's now available already andyou'll start to see in our demo that wecan create external spaces alreadywe've already launched our migrationapis to developer preview Cloud fuse isalready using that and enhancing theirmigration tool to support slack channelsbeing migrated to chat spaces and one ofthe key things about our migration APIis that we maintain historicaltimestamps imagine messages from slacklast year we wanted to make sure thatthat time stamp could be persisted intoGoogle Chat so that that conversation isrelevant for that timeI'm also excited to announce that in Q3we'll be launching our events apis forchat app developers we've talked aboutmessage interoperability one of the keyneeds for an events API is to supportreal-time message delivery as close toreal time as possiblewith this events API developers will nowget notifications on new messages in thespace new members being added to a spaceand moreand now I'd like to like to introduceSean winter SVP of strategy and customerexperience at lumaps thank you Mikethanks for having me absolutelythank you Ramesh that was greatum thank you all for being here yes Iknow we're between you and happy hourI'm like officially between you andhappy hour now but you're nearing theend and that's it that's certainly anachievement uh my name is Sean winterI'm fortunate enough to work for LouMaps who has been a Google workspacepartner since 2016. uh so we're thrilledto see the developments that are comingfrom the chat team we're hugelypassionate about intranets how many ofyou have an internet at your company andknow what an internet isyay look at that we're at the rightplaceum so thank you for having an internetwe'd love to tell you a little bit abouthow we think about where we're goingwith these great chat advancementsSean for the audience can you share abrief overview of lumaps and youroverall Vision please abs absolutely sowe are the only recommendeduh internet for Google workspace we sitvery nicely on top and aggregate all ofyour company's Knowledge ManagementCommunications in a very consumerfriendly way where your employees can besure to understand what's going on andbe aligned and the typical challengewith internets is that employees wantthat stuff in the places where they dowork in the flow of work so what betterstory than to start bringing some ofthat to chatoh I went the wrong waywhat's your perspective on the modernknowledge workers needs and where do youthink platform Integrations andPartnerships fit into that yeah so as wethink aboutSolutions and Building Solutions whetherit's from a product or businessperspective we think about aligning todifferent Trends out there there arelots of Trends to look at right now asyou know from the pandemic through totoday we are going through nothing butchange spoiler alert that's not going tochange in the future we're going tocontinue to go through some prettymassive change with everything that'scoming but some of the trends that wetry to align to and try to helpemployees make employees lives easierare the following so one the notion ofautomation on the Fly for knowledgeworkers we've obviously done a great jobwith automation for factory workers forFrontline workers typically knowledgeworkers are still left to work in a veryunstructured way so how can we bringrepeatable tasks and experiences toemployees where they are in the toolsthat they like to usesecond is the notion of the emergence ofremote and distributed work we are allprobably working through hybrid workscenarios in some way shape or form thisis obviously here to stay it's changed alot uh in the past few years with thatemployees expectations have changed uhprobably during the pandemic we relied alittle too heavily on synchronoustechnology tools so think your meetingtools your chat tools which relied onsomeone else being at the other end liveat that specific time I work for aglobal company my peers are nine hoursaway time zone wise is that right todaychanges by the day so asynchronous workis really really important to us how canwe use chat as typically a synchronoustool to bring asynchronous experiencesinto chatthe third one is the notion of customerdata platforms and employee data layersso does anyone here know what a customerdata platform isthere's these huge databases that gatherinformation about you so that if Mikeand I were having a conversation andthere was a a voice enabled AI devicenearby suddenly I opened my phone to asocial network and maybe I'll see an adfor the thing that we're talking aboutand you say whoa that is scarythe fact of the matter is Enterpriseshave an amazing amount of data on howtheir workers like to work it's anincredibly awesome and potentiallypowerful thing what if we use that todrive experiences because we know forinstance maybe Mike loves to live inchat all day I love to live in GmailRamesh loves to live and meet what if webrought that together really elegantlythrough some middle layers so that thoseexperiences all match togetherand then finally most importantly wework a lot with our analyst friends onthe nature of human-centric work designbigger than ever given that AI is comingto the party if you haven't noticedtoday and it's coming to the party invery very interesting ways how do weensure that we as technology providersprovide Tech that is inherently humaninherently empathetic inherently elegantso that people actually not just notjust need to use it but want to use itto make their work lives bettera couple more quick questions yes sirwhy did you decide to build anintegration with Google Chat and whatdoes your integration do yeah so a fewquick use cases up here to highlight sothe first one is the notion of employeeswanting to work when where and how theywant to work you'll probably hear me saythat 10 different ways in the next 10minutes but this is something that wereally believe in and you'll see fromthis example here the notion of takingcontent that may exist in your internetand Loom maps and being able to sharethat directly to a space in chat to aperson in chat on the fly so this issomething that we're going to continueto build this out over time to have moreexperiences like this but again how canwe take all the wonderful contentCommunications that we have in Loom appsand bring them to employees in the flowof worksecond one is this notion of especiallythis this really hit if you've seen alot of HR studies during the pandemicthe notion of employees cravingconnection especially in a hybrid workmodel and Social Capital so let's say Icome across an interesting article aboutmental health awareness month at mycompany in my internet and I immediatelywant to actually connect with the personthat is passionate about that that wrotethat they may be on the different sideof the world right but we allow fordirect integration with Google Chat tosay here's the author of this I wouldlove to have a conversation oh and lookthis person's online let me chat withthem nowand then the third and this is the mostchallenging one is typicallyCommunications whether they come throughemail whether they come through someform of Internet whether they comethrough any variety of mechanisms theyreally need to stand out today more thanever right so how can in chat how can wedeliver elegant beautiful designedCommunications that are scheduled intime so again back to my example aboutMental Health Awareness Month what if Ineed a certain message to go out Mondayanother one Tuesday and I just want toset that all up before the month and saythat these I want to go to chat these Iwant to go to Gmail these I want to goon the internet are all of the above sowe've enabled that as well as a greatway again to bring Communications tochat where people arecan you share with the audience what isnext in your roadmap for Loom Maps yeswe are very actively working uh on thisand I am thrilled to say that the loomapps for Google chat app will belaunching imminently we're dealing witha few time zone challenges but should beup in the next few hours yes yes thumbsup from our head of engineering uh sowe're super excited about that but weare going to continue building this outagain we passionately believe in how dowe bring all of the content andCommunications that we provide in theflow of work so the notion of tighterintegration between chat spaces and Loomapp spaces is something where we thinkthere's a lot of play betweensynchronous work and chat asynchronouswork and Loom apps uh gen AI issomething we get a ton of questionsabout whether it's around contentcreation and question answering anddigital Assistance or a lot of ourcustomers say you know what can you useAI to do the boring parts of my job thatI don't want to do anymore contentcleanup content targeting content movingthose types of things and then finallylumaps is a great a great system fororganizing around virtual events solet's say I want to plan a town hallthat requires work to be done beforethat requires the actual town hall withq a and materials during and then forposterity's sake the art the umthe hosting of that long term rightwhich influenced search and other thingsso we're working now on an integrationdirectly with meat so that lumaps can bethe frame with all the materials andthen meat can actually be the town halland finally we love your smart chips sowe try to bring those everywhere that wecanso I really appreciate it you all havebeen a great partner we're thrilled tobe here and I know I think you're goingto demo now yeah let's do it all rightMike let me pass it back to youthere you go thank you so much yeah Iappreciate it[Applause]all right as Sean mentioned let's puteverything that we've talked about todayand let's build a chat uplet's go back to that favorite use caseof mine Incident Management and why Ilike this use case is it because itcombines so many of the visual elementsin a chat app and the programmaticaccess of our chat apis so let's see howa fictional customer service team usesthe Google Chat API to streamline theirIncident Management workflowour chat app like the pagerduty one willbe monitoring a third-party service toensure that the service is meeting itsSLO commitments to its customers and itsusers if the surface is down we'llcreate a chat space we'll add TheIncident Management on-call team likeSRE support Eng product managers we'llalso add some messages to highlight someof the investigations that the chat apphas done to save time for those IncidentManagement members that were added tothat space they can already see thehistory of what's happened and what thechat app has been able to accomplishfinally we'll export all of thosemessages into a Google doc for postmodem trackingfor our demo we're going to simulate theoutage of a service by using a page toindicate that Something's Happenedall rightonce the issue has been detected ourchat app will create a new space fortrackingone thing I do want to highlight sorrytwo things I want to highlight actuallywhen I was writing this slideyou'll see here that these are just codeSnippets they're not the full code thatyou need to create a chat space and thesecond thing that I wanted to highlightisI did not enjoy typing URL fetch so muchso if you're familiar with apps scriptone of the things that we are nowlooking into is building an apps scriptAdvanced service for chat to make itmuch easier to use chat commands rightwithin apps scriptin order to quickly start ourtroubleshooting our chat app will addnew members to the space for our examplewe'll just add some static membersfor homework yes I am giving youhomeworkI'll leave it as an exercise to you tolook up the appropriate on-call membersusing Google CalendarSean that includes you you've got somehomework here I'm ready all right I needmoreour chat app will also add some messagesto the space to inform members of whattroubleshooting the chat app has beenable to doRamesh talked about Slash commands solet's add a slash command that themembers can use once the incident hasbeen resolved we'll quickly invoke aslash command to close out the incidentfinally we'll use the Google Docs API tocreate a Google doc for postmortemtracking and will generate a sum of thesummary of the incident as it happenedpretty straightforward right let's lookat some of the building blocks andprerequisites that we had to use to getthis chat app to work our first step isto create a Google Cloud project andenable the following apisand don't worry about writing down thesesteps we'll have a link to where we'vealready posted this on our developerssite one of the other things that you'llnotice is if you use our tutorial on theGoogle developers page we've alsoincluded vertex AI to generate a summaryof the conversation in the postmortemdocknow we'll make our app as an internalonly app for oauth verification We'lladd the necessary Google Chat scopes forcreating a space adding numbers andcreating messagesa little bit more homework for you ifyou're really interested make it anexternal app and publish it to theGoogle works based Marketplacewe'll create our app script connected tothe gcp project and you'll see that I'vejust got a generic error message toon uh sorry we've how we'll have the appreturn a text message on an event tomake sure it's working as it's expectedonce we've deployed the app script let'sconfigure the chat app itself and thisis the chat API configuration page inGoogle Cloudwe have to configure the app name theavatara description of the app and then we'llmake sure that the enable interactivefeatures is selected this way your appcan receive one-on-one messages or beadded to a spaceour connection settings will point tothe apps script project that we've justcreatedit's pretty easy to add a slash commandso we'll add a slash command that theusers will be able to use to close outthe incidentfinally let's add all of the code forour app now so that you don't have towatch me type I did have a video butthanks to our Tech experts no one Alexinstead of watching a video we're goingto try this live so wish me luck if wecan jump to the computer pleaseokay so if you rememberI was going to use a page to simulate anincident happeningI'm going to add Ramesh as an incidentmanagerso him and I can talk about an incidentthat has happenedall right here we goand our chat app created a space awesomewe'll open that space and Ramesh and Ican communicate to talk about what'shappened with the incident and you cansee here that I've already got somemessages in therecrossing my fingersRamesh and I are conversing about what'sgoing onthanks Ramesh that was really helpfuldo you have any more actual suggestionsand of course it's going to be my faultbecause I pushed a code change to prodlet's assume that was the reason for theincident I'm going to close thatincidentwe'll pull up our slash commandI heard a few people get itso we'll close out the incidentand if you notice we've generated aGoogle doc I'm just going to open upthat Google docand one thing that our demo that'sfeatured on the Google workspacedeveloper site we've also Incorporatedvertex AI to generate a summary of theconversation and it did pretty well if Iread thisit did really well it called me anengineer awesomeum okay and Ramesh says it looks likethey'll Miss happy hour that's prettyimpressiveum okay Oops I did not strip out theslash commands but I'll leave that as anexercise to youand if we could switch back to theslides please[Applause]that was from last night so thank youfor your supportI know we've covered a lot todaybut we've really just touched thesurface of what you can do withworkflows in workspace and Google chatwith our new chat apis and chat appswe have a number of great resources onour workspace developers page pleasevisit our developer docs to accessexamples code labs and yes even the demothat we built today is now live on thedevelopers pageplease also make sure that you sign upfor the workspace developer previewprogram to stay in the loop when newfeatures are announced and to access allof our apisand one last thing for those of you whohave not watched my developer Spotlighton the YouTube channel which is prettymuch everyone uh please make sure you dowatch it and give it a like subscribe tothe channel uh so that we can actuallyoffer more uh developer spotlightsand there are some interesting linksabout what's next uh for next pleasemake sure Ramesh and I will be at theinnovators Hive tomorrow so if you dohave any questions please feel free tocome visit us at the booth we'veactually got a few more questions a fewmore minutes for questions so if you dohave a question please come up to themicrophone and ask Sean Ramesh and Iwill still be around afterwards as wellthanks everyone[Applause]foreign"
