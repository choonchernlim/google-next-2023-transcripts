    "transcript": "[Music]thank youmy name is pankajuk I need the GoogleCloud business unit for LTI mindtreetoday we're going to talk about a veryinteresting topic very close to many ofour hearts uh you know many of us uhhave in the recent pastsetup Enterprise data warehousesEnterprise data platforma lot of Empirical research has beendone in the past few years on howimportant data strategy isto your business strategy and how itactually creates true differentiation inthe marketsumand many of you who and many of ourclients have actually set up theseEnterprise data warehouse platformsandand they spent a lot of energy doingthat today what we want to do is we wantto actually expand the aperture of yourstrategy in two different waysand we talk through that a little bitand we will actually you know with me Ihave uhactually he leads thethe data and analytics practice for LTMentryand we also have a niche Anish actuallyis the CIO and CDO forgenius bank and he has a very veryinteresting story to tell us whichactually kind of will cement thethoughts we're going to talk aboutso these are the two these are the threeof us uh you know my picture is fiveyears old so I think you should be ableto figure that outum actually maybe 10 years old so sothat's ussoso now let's talk about the and we'lltalk about the two two ways to expandtheir per so let's just start over thefirst thingso this is uh as you can see in thepicture this is actually Mount Everestso there was a research done by theBritish medical journal about six yearsbackof all the fatalities that happened from1921 to 2006 on Mount Everest192 people died on Mount Everestbetween 1921 and 2006.what was most interesting was that 56percent of those people died after theyhad ascended the peak of the MountEverest which is 29 000 feet they got tothe 29 000 feet they celebrated and Ithink they kind of forgot that they hadto get down or they actually didn't planfor getting down uh if you know a littlebit about Mount Everest or any other 8000 8 000 feet mountains uh the deathzone starts at 26 000 feetso as people were starting to get down56 percent of the people actuallywho died actually died died when theywere getting downso it's really really important torealize that once you set up yourEnterprise dataway housethere's a lot of stuff to be done so youneed to celebrate of course but you haveto think of the life aftervery very important so that's the firstaperture we're going to actually talkabout so think aheadonce you do that once you set up yourEnterprise data warehouse platform thinkahead think of the life afterso that's your firstaperture of expansion of the aperture ofthinking when you when you thinkpresident Warehouse strategy so that'snumber onenow I'll talk about the second thingas you guys see this beautiful animal isa dragonflythere wasthere's a lot of research being done onthe hunting success rate of animalsso if anybody wants to take a guess howmuch is a the hunting success rate of atigerI'll give the answer it's actually 15percenthow much is a hunting success rate of alion or a pack of lions lions orlionesses hunt in packsit's 25 percentperegrine falcon falcon which actuallyis a very very bright and the fastestone of the fastest birds in the worldthey actually dive down they actuallydive down and then they actually they gofor the kill and they actually shootback up again they are hunting successrate is 47 percentyou look at all the animals in theanimal kingdom the hunting success ratewill range from 15 percent toto the top of the pack is the is thewild dogs it's 67 percentthere's one animal which actually standsout and that is dragonfly the huntingsuccess rate of a dragonfly is 95percentnow I'm why am I telling this to youI'll tell it to you in a second but youknow but it's just very very intriguingso actually Harvard medic Howard uhHoward University actually did someresearch onumon dragonflies and they try to figureout you know what's going on you knowhow are they so successfulso what really happens is that adragonfly has a compound eyeit has 30 000 facets of where theinformation comes into the brainand it covers almost 360 degree of ofthe environment around itthe information comes into the brainit gets processed and it has four wingsand those wings work very independent ofeach other so what's really happening isthe animal is wiredto be able to take informationand that information actually is 360degree information from a whole varietyof different sources it gets processedand the wings work independently andtherefore the dragonfly can actuallypower up down left right and it can juststay around so what's really happeningis your information is actually in manywaysgetting captured from a variety ofdifferent sources process and andexecuted onin a very very differentiated waynow the reason this is importantis when we think of uh when we think ofour data strategy we think of setting upthe Enterprise data warehouse platformwhat we forgetis the act of Thinking Beyond which isactually think the entire Journey end toendthink Beyondwhat information are you going to gethow are you going to process thatinformation and how will you execute allthat information so that's the secondpoint I wanted to make so when you arethinking of your Enterprise datawarehouse strategy there are two thingsyou need to think aboutthink ahead what's a life after once youset up your Enterprise data warehousehow are you going to actually manageyour Enterprise data warehouse after youset it up and you have to think beforeyou get to your Mount Everest andcelebrate yeah you should have thoughtabout it do you have enough oxygen haveyou thought through that or how are yougoing to get down you know are youactually going to get down on time howwill you actually work in a team orwhatever else you need to think aboutbut think ahead and the second thing isthink holistically think every aspect ofyour entire Enterprise data warehouseincluding what information are you goingto seek how are you going to processthat information and how are you goingto execute all that informationnow to actually cement this I'm going toactually invite jet is actually going totalk aboutuh how you execute to these twoexpansions of aperture and then afterthat I'll invite Anish who will actuallytalk through a specificvery very interesting story which wewill talk about how we actually do thatso just over to youokayuh thank you so much for taking time inthe morning I know yesterday you all hada very interesting Keynote and thereason you must be wondering some of youabout starting with Everest to dragonflywhat's going on here I think the idea isabout we talk about in the data Worldnarratives and storytelling and bringingto the attention of people why you needto do the right investment I hope youare done really reasonably good job interms of getting your attention aboutwhy this session is started with somekind of a storyuh I go with my name Jeff and I've beenin the industry for last 26 years doingdata analytics and I for many clientsover the years and I can't tell you thisis the best time for people who are inthe data professionals who are investingin data and trying to drive for thefirst time everyone is talking about howdo I really get best out of my data andhow do I drive more monetization and I'msure every year there is a new buzzwordone year and it's a return is the newoil another year data monetization dataMarketplace data products I think youname it we have gone through all of thatI think this year probably the the newstory is going to be Janai and I'm sureeach of you has seen very interestingdemosis today and some of us got achance preview of that much ahead oftime we were able to bring that in ourSolutions and started driving to theclients so what I'm just taking the cuefrom what Punk had started about all ofus know in the industry data Investmentsbeen happening over the yearsand there is nothing new what we aretalking about but what is new and whatis old is I'm going to quickly touchupon todayso ifoops sorryyeah sorryso if you think aboutthere are a few things which all of usknow over the years and I think it'salways important to talk about thosebasic I think my friend from my goodfriend always talk about three thingsimportant in life which is about havinga good slave good food good exercise allof us know but uh many of us don't doall the three regularly the same waysome of these points all of you knowit's not about you don't know or wedon't understand but over the yearsthere is not enough time spent on theseareas by each of us and our investmentsso let me touch upon each of them in avery clear manner the first one is aboutuser adoption if you heard about anyhorror stories about dataimplementations I think one of the bigreason is thisthe user adoption people are used to usea particular technology people who aregetting information from a particulararea suddenly we go and talk to themabout we are migrating to cloud and onceit is done everything is taken care andthey don't have enough Comfort once theygo to the new area whether it is becauseof lack of understanding lack ofawareness whatever is the reason so oneof the most important is a user adoptionand evolution as the users start usingI'm sure you all agree with me theybecome more hungry about the data theywould like to get information muchfaster so part of whenever we thinkabout new implementation and newmodernization it is very important forus to put enough effort on thatnumber two just getting into anattention getting synops rightand I'm sure those of you heard aboutthe since implementation of cloud ourcosts are gone up any of you face thatand I'm sure quite a few of thecustomers went through that kind of ajourney the reason for that is maybe itis not well understood well thoughtthrough not an architecture is done forthe right reason maybe simply a lift andshift kind of thing is done and alsothere is some kind of a misnomer mythpeople think about going to cloud isgoing to give infinite scale so peoplecan play whatever they want people canexplore whatever they want and may notrequire all of that so it's veryimportant part of this datamodernization we need to set the phenopsright so otherwise people tend to giveCloud implementation or is notsuccessful it's nothing to do with thatcloud it's to do with the way the setupand architecture principles has to beright so that's the second you know Iwanted to bring it to your attentionI'm going to cover a little more deepernot living at that headline but I justthought that's an important aspectthe third one is about the data qualityand observability whatever name you talkabout the data is getting flooded ineach of our organizations and I'm sureuh you all seen the same updates abouthow many Zeta mobiles better milesthat's happening even in the urbanorganization day to day so it'simportant to have as we invest on theseareas how we are able to Leverage Theend-to-end automation of thatinformation if I have to give those ofyou watch Keynotes today if your entireoperations you're able to get an audityou're able to get end-to-end view youare able to get solving those problemsin real time how good it isand that's an area you have to thinkthrough and each of us wanted ourinvestments to get zero Ops no Ops orvery less Investments on the OperationalSupport so that's where data quality anddata Ops is going to be very verycritical and the only way we are goingto get users Comfort is about quality ofthe data and then finallythese days more important is aboutsecurity and privacy all of us seen nnumber of incidents and the regulationsand others so in a simple way I willtalk about the usabilityand then the performance which includethe cost and then the quality and thenfinally the privacy these are the fourbig things all of us uh you know have toreally think through enough while goingthrough this journey and again as Istarted with it's not about we don'tknow but often they were underestimatedwhen we start our journey and most oftenwhen you go back and root cause analysisof a programs which were in difficultsituations by any organization you mayend up finding one of themor you may find the implementations aredone well but over the course of timeyou have written on investment is notreally what you plan for and again itboils down to one of these thingswhy are we talking about all thesethingsso if you think about user adoptionum those of you have any of you I'm sureI'm assuming all of you have completedsome form of data modernization datamigration are setting up your data todrivewhy do I do that why are we investing somuch on going to Cloud why is there socrazy about everyoneI think bottom line is in my view twoparts one is about data democratizationgoing to Cloud will help you if you area large conglomerate you're an MNC oryou're a company which is part of thelargest supply chain you can exchangeinformation you can share information sodata monetization is one big thing andthen naturally the next big thing isgoing to be how do you really make sureyou are able to give the informationright time right place at right level ofyou know light level to the peopleso when we go to modernization one ofthe thing which we found quite a fewtimesis about you have the users who areusing the reports and there are quite afew people who are doing Downstreamsystems where you are sharinginformation and there are set of peoplewho are your data scientists and ml Opsengineers and others so you have adifferent types of personas in yourbusinessand oftentimes we realize yourmodernization you are not taking careall of them in terms of what you need todoso it is important for us to look atwhat are the different personas and howeach of them are going to consume thatinformationand it's not done properly we found manytimes organizations are going throughsuddenly they realize we have someDownstream systems they're still lookingfor FTP and it may sound very weird whenpeople are talking about Cloud Journeybut unfortunately world still has a lotof such systems now you cannot postponeyour production go live out of the bluesaying about your Downstream system sowaiting for it so just to get yourattention it is important to have theright personas it is important to haveyou know understanding with each of themI'm sure all of you would have seenthe nudging the users and bring makingsure users are used you know used to aparticular screen a particulartechnology for last 10 15 whatever yearsthey've been using their reports for 10years 15 years suddenly we go and talkto them about start using Lookers startusing something else it's going tocreate beautiful features while it maybe great for us as a technologist or asa business people who are implementingthe programs the end user many timesfeels it's not as easy as it is for themeither two reasons one probably they'renot been involved in the beginning orsecond they don't have enough comfortwith usage of it so the folks one of thethings which I wanted to bring is aboutwe need to plan for that and we need tonudge and we need to ensure someChampions about itthe next one I wanted to bring it toyour attention is about the phenobsI think if there is one area which wehave seen significant amount of interestin last one year and this is onewhile the user personas and others arealways there but synopsis The phenomenaas more workloads are going to Cloud theInvestments are doubling tripling forthe organizationand what does that meanand I'm sure some of you would have readIDC and bunch of other analysts talkingabout 40 percent of cloud Investmentsthe organizations are going throughdifficult simply because a huge amountof burn is happening then what they planand when you plan your return oninvestment that's not what has been doneso it is important to have your phenopsahead of time and have a clearstructured mechanismwhile you give Comfort to your end usersComfort your line of business how theycan use the information but it is veryimportant you have a monitoring of thatand I think we need to helpand those of you tried and testedsuddenly a Big Bill is coming with yourcredit card using a one of the cloud I'msure you all of you gone through or allof you seen in your historyand I think that's where I again insisteach of you to think about phenops isthe area where your implementation canbe not just successful but it willsustain for much longer termthe next thing I wanted to bring itattention is about the data quality anddid a governance piece of itI think often they have seen over theyearsthe data quality if there is one thingwhere you get a trust with your endusersis about data quality and these days weare no longer using Data Warehouse justas a warehouse whenever we have a timewe will look at it today we are usingdata warehouses data Lakes as a missioncriticalsome of the organizations looking thatfor their financial statements some ofthe organization looking for realregulatory some of them lookingreal-time supply chain efficiencies someof them looking at real-time credit cardfraud kind of thing so this data Estatesare mission critical so in a missioncritical environment you cannot be youcannot have a situation where your dataquality it's not a complete it's notaccurate so that's where I think enoughimportance has to be given not when youare doing modernization but once youcomplete modernization you may gothrough your organization may go throughmergers and acquisition your automationmay go through new implementation yourorganization may go through a set of newregulatory requirements so it is veryimportant to have enough Focus right upfront and I'm sure all of us know thereare enough methodologies there areenough Technologies and toolkitsavailable even within the gcp ecosystemso I think a lot of investment had to bedone there again folks this is very veryunderestimated during the implementationby every organization and whethersuddenly we keep hearing about modeldrift data drift and you know there aresome challenges in our system our cxo isstill very unhappy with what ishappening and we are still trying tofind out a single view of our customerwe are still trying to fuel single viewof our products all those challengesduring modernization if you're nottaking enough importance you may end upwith that so that's where it isimportant to have data quality and datagovernance uh in area and I'm very happyto say today luckily a lot of AI and genAI is really helping uswhat I mean by that iswe we used to many many years back thoseof you started more than 10 years back15 years back 20 years back we had toliterally manually capture the metadatamanually capture data cataloging andtoday we can use Chennai to scan to giveour code scan your databases andactually help you to drive your metadataand data quality and data catalog muchbetter way and that's an area when wetalk about data quality we should usethe new tools and techniques to solvethe old problem data quality problemalways existed but now we have new waysto solve that much faster but I thinkthat should be part of your uh you knowecosystemand then finallyeveryone wants now a data Marketplaceand I'm sure all of you would have heardabout how we can actually make moremoney by monetizing our informationnow if you think aboutthis is where it's very important for adata security and privacyevery organization wants to make moneyfrom theirand I'm sure each of you would haveheard from your cxo saying ourcompetitor is making much moremeaningful out of the data they areusing the data to build new productsthey're using the data to improve theiroperationthey're using the data to actually drivemore Revenue I'm sure all of you haveheard aboutand these days all of you have heardabout data marketplace where youactually can share your information in aMarketplace and get some users consumeit and get the data out of it the sameway you may be consuming somebody elsein the marketplace the information sohow that will connect the dots fieldso againwhich has been very very fascinating foreveryone to make money from this butvery little understood by most of theorganizations how do you begin thisjourney am I going to share informationwhich is going to be competitive youknow then am I going to lose mycompetitive Advantage do I keep all thedata in the marketplaces how do I getthe security and privacy of theinformation in this whole journeyI think we keep hearing about if yourorganization is a multinational workingin 30 countries 80 countries 100countries these days it's become a veryvery easy for every country to come outwith their own data privacy and theirown policies and it's going to be verydifficult and each of you in this roommay play A Whiter role in terms of howdo you really bring that so that's whythe data privacy and security plays amajor role in helping your organizationsto not just monetize the data but makesure you don't get into any regulatoryhassles you're going to get into that soin short folks uh what I could impressyou is about the four pillars which youtalked about the usability make sureyour new Investments are usableotherwise you just dump something fromsomewhere to somewhere it's not going tobring number two make sure your CloudInvestments on synops are super plantahead of timenumber three data quality is the onlyway with which your Investments aregoing to be sustained and then finallyit is important to have your privacy andSecurity in place with the amount ofchallenges world is seeing now and alsogenii is creating lots of opportunitiesfor all of us in our business but at thesame time there is lot of guardrails arerequired and that's why it is importantto plan ahead of time and do this sothat your entire Investments on cloudwill actually exponentially give yourwritten on investment so that's some ofthe things which I thought give aperspective you and then final pointall of you would have heard aboutdecision support would you mind raisingyour hand decision supportokay now from decision support now weare talking about decisions augmentationand then finally we are talking aboutdecisions automationwe want to reach a stage where with AIand gen AI your data estate can startbecome a decisions automation where yourcompany will start driving a businesstransformation truly not just a lipservice or business transformationthat's what I thought I'll give someperspectives very happy to hear somequestions later part of time but I'llpass the mic to Anish thank youthank yougood morningthank youpankaj thank you chit for setting thestageum so now let me add to the story withuh genius how a genius we are looking atdata driven decisionsbefore getting therelet me give an introduction I am AnishJacob I lead technologyat genius Bankand I will also give an introductionwhat is genius bank before that I haveto talk about smpc which is our parentso SMBC is one of the largest banks inthe world 12th largest bank by assetoperates over 40 plus countries in theU.S it's been operating for more than100 years primary on the commercialbusinessgenius bank is the retail division ofSMBC in U.S we started building this twoyears back we launched our first productand secured loan two months back nextproduct is ready to go which is savingsand we have like full spectrum of fullbanking product for next 10 yearssoit's sometimes very rare opportunity tobuild something from the scratch when wegot an opportunity to build somethingfrom the scratchwe want to do it little differentlywe want to make better product betterexperience better ratebetter data Insight that users can useand make some actionable actions basedon Insight insights they receiveso when we look atthese goalsdata is a critical part to that becausewithout proper data and enablement ofthat decisioning it's very difficult forany of us within the organization toachieve this goal or our customersso with that in mindwe looked at how we need to organizethis going back to Thinking Beyond andthinking ahead we don't want to be siledor short-sighted with our needs nowrather than how do we put something thatcan scale as we scale our organizationgrow orproducts suits as well as customer baseso these are some of the examples on theleft side you could see that these arethe different types of decisionor use cases our users internal uses aretrying to makefrom a few exampleswhich segment of the customeris going to give the highest lifetimevaluewhich segment we should Target whichcampaign is working wellif coming to fraud what is the chancepotential chance for something to bedefault some customer to be default whatis a customer risk profilethere are additional fraud cases wherewe want to understanddefraud patterns we also want tominimize false positives so these arethe set of decisionswe could make with data but then if youlook how are we going to make thosedecisionsthere are three ways at leastum in my opinionhuman intelligenceyou could get access to data you couldlook at the data analyze it make yourdecisions through reports Etcthe other way of making decision isactuallyyou have that predefined algorithmsyou implement that and that algorithmscould make decisions on behalf of humanthird is most interesting and you mighthave heard that lastyesterday and today a lot of AI right AIgen AI but there are multiple variationsof that so there is like PredictiveAnalytics which is widely used fordecision making and now there is Gen AIwhich is kind of like adding a differentflavor which is making more humanmachine collaborationso you you have these are different wayswe want to make decisionsso when we want to make these decisionshow we Design This one how do we enablethis that's the next questionso this is how we are lookingat geniusif you think Beyond maybe when you startit is easy for one organization to doall the Data Insightsfor in theirorganizationbut it's not scalableso kind of mentioned Marketplace this iskind of a Marketplace person so you wanttodemocratize datawhat that meansyou centralize your datain one placeboth external and internal but then youdecentralize the consumption of the databut it needs to be governed well youneed to have God rulesyou need to ensure data qualitythat kind of like outlines theimportance of data qualityyou want to ensure proper access controlfor that data you also want to enableflexible analytics becausewhen you democratize data based on theauthorization oror the need they should be the usershould be able to get the data into alocal environmentor their own work area means not not themachines like in in an infrastructurewhere they could actually analyze thedatathey could actually model the dataand use data to make right decisionsso nowwith all this in mindthis is what we have donea geniusthey decided to build an ecosystemthat supportsdata centralization and also that cansupportdecentralized consumptionwe haven't built all of this yet we arein the path of building some thecentralization is almost donedecentralization is actually being builtas we speakso if we look at some examples I talkedabout loanswe have multiple sources where we getthe data our core banking underwritingApp application uh processing componentswe get data at customer level we getdata at account level we also get dataat transaction level we want all thisdata coming to a landing Zone one placethen sequence of processes likesecurity encryption cleaning aggregationtransformation and then the storagewe store it totwo different formats like one is rowfile format at our data Lakeand the other one is actually moretabular format uh using bigquery in ourdata warehousethat is more accessibleand also more domain drivenwe are using pretty much Googleecosystemin this process becauseum when we when we looked at differentoptions we foundthis ecosystem probably meet our needsand we can scale and we could considerother tools if we need uh if we see aneed in the future but right now we kindof like pretty much went with uhfullum full of Google set of tool setum one exception probably data governsgovernance we are using collibra becausethat's kind of our standard across theboardbut it's well integrated with theecosystembut the idea is actually like once youhave Central data through propergovernance qualityyou enable this through to differenttype of uses likeit could be a leased environment itcould be their own for example creditteam could have their own environmentwhere they could actually like get thedata analyze the data build their creditrulesexperimentand then push into productionthey could visualize that we have lookerso looker will enable you to visualizethe data we do have a Vertex AI platformthat eventually can be used to enhanceyour modelingsowe thought like this type of anenvironment is easilyscalableand also can support today we have loanstomorrow we have savings and we aregoing to have credit card differentdifferent products when we add over theyears this modelshould be able to scale and support ourneedswe probably will make uh adjustment aswe learned but the idea is actually howdo we put together a vision where we canMarch towardssoOne Challenge we experienced to us likeit's a different problem it's a goodproblem to have many organizations arelooking for transformationfor us a different problem we need tobuild it from scratch but when you buildthis from scratchthe challenge isyou're building the organization as wellthen you don'tyou know you're gaining the skill setwho knows the data and also who canbuild the platform right this is wherelike we used lot of partnership andProfessional Services to acceleratethose development that really helped sowe blend ourinternal team with industry expertiseand kind of likebuild one cohesive team that canactually help uswith the build out of some of thesebuilding blockswhich kind of like pave the road for thefuturewith that I willconcludemy sessionand I think it's it's been an amazingjourney a genius just want to make apoint that we are hiring we are lookingfor a lot of expertise in Google becausewe are committed to investing Googleso I'll call pankaj for uh closingthoughtsthank youyeah uhthanks Anish thanks so um I think uhthere's generally a lot to absorb in asession like this and I I think let mejust simplify and just bring thoseanalogies back in again so there are twothings if you if you need to rememberfrom this session two things think aheadthink Beyond think ahead project talkedabout think about observability thinkabout Fin Ops think how you're going todo user adoption very very important andthen Anish brought it to life on how youcould actually bring this all togetherto create the business impact you needto create so you need to actually thinkabout you know what's your use case howare you going to usethe data platform you're going to set upand how will you actuallyuh turn that into meaningful action sothose are the two things you need toremember so if you're actually climbinga Mount Everest celebrate when you getto the Mount Everest but also think howyou're going to get down what the nextsteps are so that's think ahead thinkBeyond you know we do a lot of learningfrom biomimicry I think think about adragonfly think about every aspect ofyour data to decision Journey not justthe central data warehouse or the dataplatform you're setting up[Music]"
