getinto this conversation about diversityand and why diversity is so important toour startups um so we're going to DiveRight In and talk a little bit aboutcreativity and innovation in diversityso we'll start with you Anna so why isit important that startups Embracedifferent cultures perspectives andideas uh you know look I've done I guessthree three or four startups myselfincluding some that were my own with mysister um and I think what's becomereally more and more clear is thatwhatever product you're building and I'ma product person you know I've beendoing them forever um is that it has torepresent your user base and your userbase is really diverse even if you don'tthink you know even if you don't thinkabout it that way one of the biggestthings a product person will first startwith iswho's going to be using my productsunder what conditions are they going tobe using my products um and when youstart really clicking and clicking andclicking into those really importantquestions that are going to be criticalfor your product to be successful inMarket fit this diversity point isreally important and I think that's youknow um one of the biggest things I willjust use an example I don't have it withme but you know we do make pixel phonesand you know I remember this was asession the the sign lead for our groupis a woman it's I Ross very you knowvery famous person and her and I were ina meeting well we ran late to thisdecision meeting where we were going totalk about sort of the final dimensionsof the phone when we got there they haddecided some dimensions and then her andI grabbed it and we were both like superuncomfortable with it we're like that'sjust like not going to work like it'sway too wide look at how uncomfortableit is for us so you know these arereally tiny things like we're talkingabout you know millimeters here but itmakes a huge difference so I think anycompany that truly thinks deeply abouttheir users and really thinks deeplyabout what what their experience isgoing to be like will be way better offfrom the very scratch so I I always sayyou know you're the maker should reflectthe users and I think that's the bestway that I can summarize why I thinkit's such an important part for fordiversity from the bat and you can tellby the way you can tell by the colorsDimensions you can tell somebody thoughtabout it or not yeah I love that the thedesigner should the the product shouldrepresent the user yes so reallydesigning with users in mind it'scritically important awesome cassandreyour thoughts on this one yeah I thinkjust to add on and complement what Annasaid is I think even though we exist inThis Global World our Global is likeright in front of us and I think youknow as I owned a company before uh afashion company before but anyhow whenyou think about your audience right infront of you or your customers right infront of you they come from all kinds ofbackgrounds and so forth and part of thebeauty of that too is they bring whothey are and their authenticity andtheir cultures too so in able to inorder to engage you have to you knowjust be mindful and just you know justEmbrace that uniqueness which I think itjust make your product or you knowwhatever it is services that much moreapplicable and relevant to that customerbase and you know the most powerfulthing is when you have these differententities individuals spreading the wordof how great your product is and so manydifferent perspectives because itresonated with themlike that is just so amazing oh that'sawesome so making products that areimpactful for the user as well awesomeawesome and Su your thoughts I thinkthey've really covered it uh all theonly thing I would add is like I thinkthe the basic frame of a startup is allaround Innovation right you are workingon new ideas ideas that nobody else isworking on and I think this is whereyour diverse perspectives are what isgoing to drive that Innovation if youdon't have people with differentbackgrounds different bringing differentperspectives you're going to be an echochamber I I can tell you that and Ithink if you want to innovate you wantto move fast you want to be agile youwant to be adaptable I think you got toembrace the different cultures and bringpeople from all the backgrounds so thatyou can build what the customer needsbasically your bubble yeah yeah awesomeI love that the power diversity and inthat and so we're going to talk a littlebit about what this looks like in actionand if I put back on my my strategicconsultant had for some years ago one ofthe things that we used to do when wewere designing products was actuallybring in folks who would actually usethe product right so have focus groupsand things of that nature so they couldreally so we could really tap into whatwas the product like in their handsright what was their true userexperience and they will give usfeedback The Good the Bad and the Uglyto help us design it better so I want toget your thoughts on that in terms ofwhat this may look like in action whenwe talk about whether user designdesigning with diversity in mindyeah um I can start with that um I thinkfor for us uh one of the things we doand just keep it mind we do software andHardware right that's what our productsare they're both we have what we callthis development uh process manycompanies have it if you're a startupyou probably don't have somethingformalized but you are going throughsome process whether it's agilewaterfall whatever it is but you aregoing through some process to developand decide like when is your productactually ready and so one of the thingswe've thought about is is for us forexample we have very particular Gatesjust give you an example one of theearly ones is okay to concept where tos's point you want somebody to beunbridled thinking about the maximummost most beautiful you know exceptionalthing they can come up with but at theend of the day that unbridle needs tosort of come down to something that'sactually you know we can make and we canship and it's you know going to work andit's not going to burn people you knowetc etc and so through these Gates we'veput these these questions these thesevery specific gate deliverables if youwill that talk about this point whereare these considerations happening didyou do this is your product serviceableis your product in how many languageswhat is the dimension of your productyou know what are the color so it startssort of forcing because it's so easyit's so overwhelming when you'redeveloping a product but this breaks itdown into sections of what are decisionsyou can't go back in time and fix and soit'll force you to basically kind ofdown select and make those decisionsover time so to me actually puttingthinking of diversity as something thatyou are doing not just as a moment increation but a moment in every singlegate that goes through is a really bigdifferentiator in how your product isgoing to show up oh I love that sotaking those kind of stage Gates andlooking at it like from a conceptperspective and all the way throughdelivery and saying okay what's ourchecklist what are the things that weneed to make sure we're doing to keepthis in mind yes and when we don't do itright sheknows let's talk about that and I can umadd on to to honor because then after toum Honors points once you develop it andthen you look at go to market you reallyhave to look at what countries whatcultures are you going to be in and I'llgive two great examples is some of ourproducts in air our European MarketMarket they have certain features thatare similar to North America and soforth but with the you know with theadvantages of search and Google andeverything people find out what featuresthey have and so forth and they're likeno I want the features that are on theNorth American model or whatnot and thenyou have the um you know those customersin APAC who they are very detailoriented and so forth and they want toknow step by step what what everyfeature provides and so forth so evenonce you create the product how youpresent it to the market really variesand you really want to connect withthose different customers I love that sois it fair to say that maybe you startwith I'm going to call it a base modelor minimal bable product whatever wecall that right and then we build on andtailor for that for each country basedon whether it be language design andthings of that nature exactly becauseit's the smallest thing to on a pointthat could be be a huge um item andthat's why like on our team if you lookat it I like to say we're kind of UnitedNations we have people who are fromEurope from a APAC and so forth but theybring that voice in because they areliving it daytoday and I think it justhelps us level set to say wait a minutehave we missed something or yes let'sdouble down on this and so forthabsolutely absolutely and so J I'm goingto take us to the next question and haveyou start there if you don't mind andbecause we've been talking about designand the product itself but then we'regoing to talk a little bit more aroundwhy diversity of thought is important insolutioning and decision-making so thisreally turns the conversation about ourpeople right so can you tell us a littlebit about that um I think we alluded ita little bit I think it's when you havepeople from uh say different backgroundsthey're going to bring differentperspective you're going to get thebreadth of the perspectives Cassandrawas just talking about uh like trainingmodels if you're training models on avery small subset of data which is notrepresentative of your customer baseit's going to be skewed it's going tohave biases from day one and so reallylike thinking about like you know it'sit helps creativity it helps you bringthose diverse perspectives right as Isaid you're going otherwise going to bein an uh Ecco chamber because you knowyou're all thinking the same if you'repeople like you in your team uh the likeme bias is what I always call it uhyou're going to be thinking exact thesame and nobody's challenging uh thestatus quo which means you're not uhyou're stifling innovation in some uhaspect and so I do believe that um it'sgoing to help you make faster decisionsit's also going to make help you makebetter decisions and uh and that willtruly push the boundaries of innovationuh in that I love that can I add to thatI think you just triggered somethingthat for me is super important you knowwe I think for many of us who study howto really bring more inclusivity in intointo into everything we do you know Ithink that this concept of belonging isa really important one right um You canbe represented and not feel like youbelong um and that's pretty commonactually I can speak from personalexperience both good and bad but what Iwill say is that I feel like how itreally comes back to the product is thisway I feel like for belonging one of theeasiest ways for people to belong tofeel like they're belonging is that youteach others to basically inquiry likebe curious if you don't understandsomething like hey Anna I don'tunderstand why you know you do this wellI'm from Latin America blah blah blahbig da you know I can explain a lot andand that person didn't know but theywere courageous enough to basically havethe inquiry and I think that is thebiggest piece that I think suata wastrying to like to me it really resonatedbecause when you have different peoplethe inquiry increases and when inquiryincreases in product development yourproduct 100% will be better so if you'resitting around I would just say in yourstartup sitting today and like everybodyagrees and there's no questions andyou're just moving moving moving I wouldargue that that is a sign that you donot have enough inquiry in your team andprobably not enough diversity in yourteam because there should be Dr onou dedebates on you know product developmentand people should be super passionateabout their products so if it's likereally quiet and nice maybe that'ssomething to check I love that so debateis good debate is good inquiry is goodinquiry is always good absolutely wouldyou like to add you know I would just umsay one additional aspect to compliments Anna is the fact that a lot ofcompanies especially startups I thinkthey have this very um kind of like Ilike to say to whom much is giving muchis required and they want to give backand I think to set up those programs oryou know to reach out into differentcommunities is so amazing and Powerfulto make sure that when you establish andset it up you really are making adifference in that community and whatnotand I know Anna and I had the honor ofworking when we were going through coidand we were trying to do some productsin different areas and so forth you knowand going through like the George Floydincident and whatnot and I remember wehad one of our googlers who um when wewere looking at like our sweederportfolios to give to like small umminority owned businesses thank goodnesshe had the the courage to speak upbecause we were not going to include oneof our products and he was like yes thisproduct is important for this communityand here's why and he had shared thathis brother had been incarcerated and hesaid this could be the differencebetween him being able to be successfulyou know in the community or his High umprobability of going back and beingincarcerated so I think just having thatyou know having those individuals ofyour team who can just not just speaktheir experiences but speak the truthfor different communities can just Ithink Elevate what you do and how you doit in a way that can be so beautiful andimpactful to different communities oh Ilove that so you're you're basicallyexpanding Beyond designing you know foryour direct consumer market right you'relooking at how you also benefit the thecommunity so designing for for goodright actually in that case we didn'tthe product was the same already it wasjust a use case we had never thoughtabout and the use case came to bebecause of the pandemic um this was oneexample we have many but uh and so allof a sudden we're like oh that that'sreally interesting like we had neverthought about that use but you're rightthat's a great way to do it so we had todo a quick software change and enable itbut it made made a huge differenceawesome love that yeah and we'll keepalong the topic of of uh belonging a bitI'm going to move us along to to thenext question in terms because I thinkwe kind of covered the the first one butin terms of you know when we talk aboutemployee voice on belonging and how thiscan help attract or retain arepresentative Workforce so again kindof talking along along the people sideof things but also so I think all threeof you play very important roles in thatwork in Google and would love for you toshare with the audience so s ohokay I I I I love belonging I mean injust the concept of it because I thinkit was something that was missing whenwe were talking about just dni uh in thebeginning uh and it it's it's for you tobe your authentic self I would say andhaving um I'm coming from a like as awoman of color and uh someone who didnot grow up here uh suffered a lot inthe beginning I feel like especially inmeetings where um my voice didn't matterin many meetings or I would or even if Isaid something uh even if I had a voicenobody validated it or uh or evenAmplified it uh which meant like Ididn't feel like I belonged right so itmay look like you know you saidsomething important in a meeting but ifnobody validated that sense of belonginggoes all off and that feeling of beingthe only one gets Amplified uh and to meI think that is uh what needs to befixed you may get everything right ingetting your diversity goals and hiringthe right people but if you can't retainthem and if you can't feel like theybelong they're not going to thrivethey're not going to be their best selfand they're not going to perform is whatlike and I've seen it for myself uh thedays when I feel like my voice matteredI feel like I belong I'm giving my bestand I know I can do better yeahabsolutely Cassandra yeah um I think SuI think said it beautifully and I thinkanother aspect is I also want toacknowledge and show appreciation rightfor allies because I think allies are socritical and so important but one of theaspects I you know um clay B find anally just to make sure yeah you want tofind an ally but one of the things toois I think for an ally really you knowwe always say we want that Ally to be ina game with us and the analogy you knowthat I've shared with some of our alliesis you know it's almost like using asports game like when you are someonefrom a underrepresented group or whatnotyou're in that game 247 you do not get atimeout whereas some of our allies whohave the best intentions they do havethe benefit or if you want to say luxuryto say hey coach I need a timeout and Ithink it's those allies who canunderstand and appreciate that they arean ally but they have that option to getout the game or take a time out out andpeople you know in the urg do not it's24/7 where there it's 9 to5 at work orafter like I'm always a female I'malways a person of color and so forthand I think that is why it's so criticalto have different representation becausenot just for that sense of belonging buta sense of understanding andappreciation and one of the things thatyou know for those who may not know likeI was hired into Google because of Annaand I always tell people that not everyinvitation is the right invitation butwhen Anna gave me that invitation it wasbecause I saw in her I saw in herleadership team and I saw in otherleaders that diversity not just of youknow gender or ethnic backgrounds butalso of voice and experiences so as yougo not just to retain but to recruit youwant to have people to feel like wow Icould be myself here I can have a voiceand I can make a difference and I thinkthat's why it's important oh that'sawesome that's AES awesome yeah I justwant to add uh a you know a big mentorof mine told me very early thankfully inmy career about recruiting whoever yousend to recruit you're going to get moreof them back so whoever you send doesn'tmatter if you send me you're going toget more people like me if we send youwe're going to send more people like youso whoever it is that's what you'regoing to get back so think deeply aboutwho you want to send to recruit and likenot every person is the right person forif you're college recruiting you knowsend fun you know younger I mean likesend people that they're going toconnect with because that's how they'regoing to make the decision it's veryhard for them to make the decision uh ifthey come back you know if they I meanhonestly even look at this panel rightif I was a guy applying to this and thisis the panel I'd be like you know Idon't know I'm not so sure so you haveto be kind of really thoughtful aboutwhat you're doing in terms of who you'resending to recruit and then once they'rehere to s's Point again awesome thatsomebody's on the table whoever it is itdoesn't doesn't matter but that doesn'tmean that their vote is getting countedright and uh nothing more annoying I'msure all four of us and many of you havehad the situation where you make acomment and somebody else repeats it bythe way it happens to my husband he's 64white guy so it has happened toeverybody but and somebody else repeatsit and then they get the credit for theidea so that's super super superannoying um and I think the moreimportant thing to to do that is whenyou're sitting there realizing boy isthis happening on my watch you know umand I think calling it out makes a bigbig difference and teeny teeny teenyteeny teeny like averaging down to zerokindness can go such a long way and soyou can just make a teeny comment tosomebody even if maybe you were didn'tfeel comfortable saying it in themeeting but you said it afterward tothem like hey I heard you that was youridea right like when that they'll justlike a thousand flowers will bloom afterthat so I would just call to action onthat uh you can make a huge differencein the culture that you want yourstartup to be uh and in my opinion veryand having lived it good startups withgood cultures good startups with badcultures the bad culture eventually atethe product for breakfast so you have tosort of keep that in mind absolutely andI think all of those are are keymessages in terms of when you're lookingto build a culture that's inclusive youhave such a great opportunity asstartups to do it from day one so that'spart of your values right if it's ifthat's embedded in your values then itbecomes part of the way you work andexpect it in behaviors of your employeesas well and the other thing I want tocall out in terms of attracting uhrepresentative workforces be open toexploring non-traditional channels rightso instead of going to the you know thesame schools or maybe the schools youmay have uh attended or what have you ifyou want to attract a representativeWorkforce be open to go to historicallyblack colleges and universities hisHispanic serving institutions communitycolleges technical colleges you'll beamazed at the talent that you find thereum to create a more representativeWorkforce so just wanted to share thatas well great awesome great awesome okayso why might a startup's Dei plan beimportant to customers so we'reswitching the gears just a little bitand we'll round it out a little bit hereso we'll give you some time to askquestions as well but when we thinkabout the startup plan for um a Deistartup plan for for these companies andwhy that could be important to customersand how how can it really help themcreate a competitiveAdvantage I feel like this is yourquestion this isyour thank you so I think it's greatbecause I think you know we hear fromcustomers I mean we get almost a billioninteractions a year and some of it isthey need help but some of it is justcomments to say hey we really appreciatethis we love how Google donated theseproducts or how we lean into this andcreating and designing you know so theproducts or the servic and whatnot and Ithink you know in this world thisamazing world we live in today I thinkmore a lot of people are just sociallyconscious and they realize that they dohave the final decision on how theyspend their dollar and they want to doit with companies at your point uh theytime that it aligns with their values italigns with you know what they believein and who they want to believe in andso forth and I think that's just soimportant I mean I have a son who's asophomore in high school and he he'seven asking questions like Mom what haveyou done today to help you know thecommunity or whatever so I think it'sjust such an amazing beautiful likeespecially younger generation I meanacross all generations but how it's socritical and it's like the core at thecore of a lot of people and I thinkpeople are making buying decisions basedon 100% I think the new generations aredefinitely making decisions based onjust how they perceive the brand andwhat they think of the brand and they'reso vocal about it and with social mediait goes viral really fast so yes what isitel culture happens right she managesher social team so yeah that's that's awhole thing whole thing absolutely andso and then also to when you're thinkingabout um customers from a Deiperspective um in in terms of who youwant to reach as well um when you're youknow maybe bidding for New Opportunitiesif you have to submit requests forproposals often times they're asking youwhat you're doing around this work rightand so that that does give you theopportunity to showcase some of theprograms that you may have some of theopportunities that you provided for youremployees whether it be employeeresource groups um whether it be uhother like Supplier Diversity programsbut things of that nature a lot of timesyou get asked for for that informationin in bids so I was just about to saythat as we since we um manage oursupplier diversity that is one things welook at for our vendors like is this asmall minority own business and we lookfor that certification and so forth andif I were to look at our top probably 15contracts I would say agood 80% of them will ask us what tohave a Supplier Diversity Programyeah"
