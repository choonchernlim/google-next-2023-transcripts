global director forhealthcare strategy and solutions atGoogle Cloudpleasure to host you allin a world where Ai and data poweredInnovations are reshaping the healthcareand Life Sciences ecosystem in theindustry the conversation about gen AIis both critical And Timelyas you saw in our keynote our ecosystemof course customers and and partners areleading the way in applying gnai inexciting waysand at Google Cloud we are committed tocreating values in broadly three bigways number one being the most open genAI platform through vortexsupporting our first party models butalso supporting variety of third-partymodels for customers to build deployground and train their gen AI models onGoogle Cloudsecond being both bold and responsiblein April we announced mid Palm 2 ourmedically tuned llm for the healthcareindustry through a trusted testerprogramand we are now expanding access tomedpom 2through more customers through a privatepreviewand third are and our third approach ismuch more any health is a heavilyregulated industry so anything we deployin dnai is grounded on privacy safetysecurity at its very core and guided byour AI principlesuh we highlighted some of that work inour keynote in in the last few days andnow I have a pleasure to dive deeperinto some of those use cases withtwo customers today the way the formatwill work I'll kick off the discussionwith Dr Schlosser we'll have a firesidechat for 25 minutes or so and then Iwill pass it over to shweta my colleaguewho will dive deeper into the lifesciences use casesso with that Dr sloshers welcome thankyou great to be hereHealthcare is a heavily regulatedindustryand according to a new bail report75 Healthcare Executives feel that Naiwill be transformational but only sixpercent have a jnai strategy in placeand you've been leading the way IndianAI how how have you shaped the Gen AIstrategy for in a regulated industryyeah well as you know because we've beenworking together on this for a long timeit's been quite a journey we startedwith uh Google Cloud almost three yearsago now uh really beginning with thefoundation that's required for Gen AIwhich is to have good data and so wesought to modernize our entire datainfrastructure we'd had an Enterprisedata warehouse that we'd used for yearsuh to look mostly retrospectively at ourdata and decided we needed to to up ourgame and really take advantage of cloudcomputing and the kinds of datainfrastructures that cloud allowed forus so that was fortunate sometimesbetter to be lucky than good so we weretwo years into our journey almost by thetime gen AI really came onto the sceneand the second fortunate thing that wedid was we stood up a new strategy thatI had the pleasure of leading calledcare transformation and Innovation andthis was a dedicated group inside of HCAmulti-disciplinary including clinicalleaders operational leader is businessfinance change management data sciencetechnology who would be solely focusedon the idea that we could use technologyto transform Healthcare delivery for thebetterso because we had those two things inplace we were in a good position whenGen AI really came onto the scene uh totake advantage of it and there were acouple of principles I would say that weapplied from the very beginning uh andthe first one which you sort of alreadyhighlighted is responsible AI so weimmediately knew we had to have astructure in place to understand theethical the legal the compliance uh thepatient safety issues around gen Ai andreally artificial intelligence ingeneral and I would say one of the keyoutcomes of those conversations was thatwe would always have a human in the loopour first use cases were never going tobe sort of directly facing a patient orused in such a way that they would bedirectly driving care in some way thatthey would always be something thatwould be recommending to a person aclinician a physician a nurse they wouldhave the opportunity to review whateverthe output was before it ever really gotinto do the clinical care settingum and the other was that we would focusthose use cases on what we refer to asadministrative burden so reallydirecting our efforts around how can wemake the lives of our caregivers betterand easier make their jobs moreefficient more effective more joyful uhreduce some of this burden that we'veheaped upon our health care providersthrough ehrs and other manual processesthat have sort of built up over time canwe start to use AI to strip that awayand bring caregivers back to the top oftheir license where they can come towork every day just focused on theirpatients and the technology can helptake away and put into the backgroundsome of that current administrativeburden so that I would say kind ofsummarizes our current thinking aboutour gen AI strategy and we're veryexcited that ocean of opportunity isdeep the amount of benefit we canprovide our caregivers I think isenormousthank you and when you talk about theadministrative burden I read thestatistics 900000 nursesplan to leave the profession by 2027.the nurses are critical to thehealthcare ecosystem and when you lookinto physician as well 60 or so facesome criteria of the burnouthow many folks you have heard of a termcalled pajama timeso on an average 90-minute Physicians gohome and spend time on clericaladministrative paperwork document stuffand these documents are important thisis how Healthcare runs there's a lot ofinformation both on the patient'sJourney but also a lot of billinginformation as wellone of the use cases that you havepicked between nurses hand off is a atthe heart of that issue on thedocumentation could you elaborate moreon that sure I will and but I want tocomment on the 900 000 and the pajamatime because I think this sometimes isuh underrepresented that we don't fullyunderstand the Gap that we have betweenthe demand for health care services inthe United States and the availableHealth Care practitioners to provide tothat demand it's nurses its Physiciansand that Gap is widening the pandemic uhtook a step up we lost a lot of peoplein the pandemic to retirement or otherroles but then that Gap just continuesto widen and so we we really need thistool this is very timely we've got tofigure out a way that we can close thatGap I mean we need more Health CareProviders and we're trying to help inthat space as well but I think AI has agreat opportunity to help us close thegap so to to your question uh one of theuse cases we are working on is around anurse handoff tool so the nurses whenthey are leaving shift have to hand offall of their patients to the nextincoming shift and as all the healthcareproviders in the room know handoffs areare always a risky time in healthcaredelivery it has to be done well it hasto be done safely so that the incomingteam knows what they need to know sothey can pick up and immediately startcaring for those patients and so it's avery manual process right now the nursesdig through the chart they keep notes onpaper throughout a shift and try tocollate all the information that they'llneed so that they can make thatintelligent handoff and so you know ifwe have 90 000 nurses across HCAthat process is probably being doneabout 90 000 different ways but it's ahuge opportunity for standardization andsafety if we can have a gen AI toolprovide that for them so we've trainedin AI we're actually trying this out inmultiple different form factors butwe've trained in AI to be able to readthe chart summarize the key informationthe the key lab values and radiology andother events that have occurred as wellas make recommendations about what arethe key things to be looking out for forthe next shift for the next 12 hours andthen produce that node in an automatedway for the uh both ongoing outgoing andincoming nurse and then they use that asa tool so again human in the loop theyreview it make sure that it's accurateand then they can use that as a way todrive that conversation it's also aninteractive tool one of the really coolthings about gen AI is that you caninteract with it in a you knowhuman-like way and so if the nurse wantsto add something to that handoff reportsay I want to know the pain scores forthis particular patient as well they canin a natural language way ask the AI toadd that to the report and it can add itin and then regenerate the report forthem with the key details um so it meetsthe nurses where they are it's not a newtool that's complicated that they haveto figure out how to use and dig throughthe EHR defined it sort of can be easilyavailable to them and they can interactwith it in a natural way and it removesburden and makes that process moresafely so we're still in proof ofconcept we're testing that at ourInnovation Hub hospital at UCF Lake Nonathat use case really is the verybeginning the the background technologythat my excellent data science team hasbuilt to enable that use case isreproducible and so we can take it tothe next idea and the next idea andthat's where things will really getexcitingthat's really exciting and as you openthe panel with the data strategyto be able to do different use cases youalready worked on the hard work oflaying down the pipes standardizing thedata in five we've been working with youon that and as we were discussing thisone of the things that you mentioned wasit's not about yes about use cases anduse cases and the models but it's alsoabout the platform and having theapproach of Blended models someprovided by Google Cloud some medpomsome palm and some even wide variety ofthird-party models can you share whythis Blended approach of and having aplatform that supports that is iscritical to to you and your journey sureand I'll use one of the other examplesuh one of the other use cases that we'reworking on right now as an example sowe're working with a company calledaugmatics which is another Googlepartner on a physician documentationsolution so an ambient listeningapproach to documentation we're doingthis in the emergency room with ERdoctors they can walk into a patient'sroom interview the patient the AI islistening through right now an iPhoneand it can transcribe the entireconversation both parties and then turnthat transcription into structureddocumentation that's a reallychallenging laborious process if you'reusing more traditional natural languageprocessing techniques gen AI hasmassively accelerated that because theAI is so capable at understanding thatlanguage but what we've found is thatthe different models are good atdifferent parts of that conversation somedpom2 for example which we're in intesting an r d phase is really good atthings like the medical decision makingwhen the physician is talking aboutreally the the critical and complicatedmedical aspects of the care because it'strained on medical data a generic modellike Palm will actually do better whenlistening to the patient talk abouttheir social history or you know thingsthat they're just doing in sort of amore natural language that a patientwould use and so to your point weactually anticipate that even a solutionlike that might use multiple models foran individual use case and then throughthose use cases we're also learning whateach model is good at and they're allgood at slightly different things and sothe idea that we have a platform wherewe can bring whichever models we need wecan train them we can put promptengineering around them it all occurs inin our private environment so all thatpatient data we're using to train doesnot go back to the space model does notgo to Google or anyone else but that'sreally powerful for us and so we'rebuilding up that IP inside our platformour instance so that again we can reuseit and we can reuse the knowledge forfor future use cases and I believethat's a big deal in your feedback onthe model creating your own promsfine-tuning that in your environmentwhich is pretty private meaning no dataleakage no IP leakage and to me that'sthe IP development to make the modeleffective for a given use caseand we all know Indian AI modelEffectiveness will be the currency ofhow Janai will be brought into into theclinical workflows are they effectivefor a given use case but technology isbut just one part of the equationyou mentioned change management what hasbeen what's been the hardest partwell the change management is thehardest part so uh we we were on a panelyesterday and I got this questionum and it immediately resonated that uhdespite the fact that we you know maybebringing the nurses an amazing tool tohelp them with a handoff we're providingPhysicians with a really great way toimprove their documentation and improvethe throughput for their you know theirworkflowum they're resistant Health CareProviders are risk isn't to change againI'm speaking to an audience with a lotof Health Care so you all know this andthey're resistant actually for a verygood reason they have people's lives uhat stake and so they feel like theyfound a way to get through theirworkflow and it's working and it's safeand so they're they're hesitant to makebig changes to it so we had to dedicatea lot of effort and a lot of resources Ihave a dedicated change management teamas part of my care transformation teamthat is purely focused on how do we helpmanage folks through this change and youactually have to do it at multiplelevels it's it's the individual doctorand nurse it's also the organization theorganizations the hospitals even HCA itcan be resistant to change sort of forthe same reasons and so we have to sortof teach and educate at every level ofthe organization so that everyoneunderstands the vision where we'retrying to go that this is really allabout helping the caregivers makingtheir lives better making the patientoutcomes better and kind of continue tosay that message over and over again butdon't overlook the the change managementaspects of this the the tools are cooland exciting and everyone gets excitedabout it but then when it comes to likeit's their turn to like do somethingdifferent their attitude sometimeschanges a little bitchange management how many startups inthe in the audience raise your handsnot manyum I was going to ask the question whatadvice but I'll change it what advice doyou have forparticipating startup ecosystem or nowin this case for healthcare LifeSciences company based on your your pastsix months intoJenny I but past two and a half years ondata yeahthe journeyum I have yet to find any sort of quickwin Easy Button kind of solutions it'suh we have to embed ourselves in thehospitals with our care teams see thingsfrom their perspective understand theirpain points how they want to see theproblem solved not get anchored in theold way of doing things of coursebecause we're trying to move forward butwe've got to sort of meet them in themiddle there and figure out how do webring them along to this new way ofworking and they have to come with usand they have to help us design thosenew Solutions so I would be weary ofanyone whose sales pitch is that we cansort of just solve this problem for youor anyone coming and selling that to youinstead I would say like you know let'sbring good technology and then let'sfocus on the process focus on the changemanagementpartner deeply which is you knowsomething that I really appreciate aboutGoogle and the work we've done togetherand then have a Long View of let's let'ssolve some big problems let's not justtry to sprinkle some gen AI on top ofour current Healthcare System so we cansay we're using it let's get get in anddig deep and solve some big problemsso thinking about talking about LongView I know we have one more questionum before we adapt this fireside chatwhere do you see five years from nowwe are we are here we're talking aboutJedi's success where do you believe thiswill have the most impact and what wewould have seen five years from now wellso I've been in and around Healthcarethere's a practicing neurosurgeon or inon the administrative side now for morethan two decades and I can honestly sayI've never been more excited about thefuture of Health Care you read that alot it's a lot of hyperbole but honestlyI think it's actually true when I thinkabout five ten years down the road Ithink we can use technology that'savailable to us now to create ahealthcare environment that is highlyefficient highly effective safe and alsojoyful for our caregivers to operate inwhere they can come to work they canjust focus on the patient thedocumentation takes care of itself themonitoring and the data is all there tosupport them it's feeding them theinformation they need at the time thatthey need it the systems are built forthem to make their workflows easiertheir lives easier as opposed to eatingHRS which were built for you knowbilling and Hospital Administration andCMS and others I think that future isabsolutely Within Reach and I think thatit would it would turn Health Care uhinto something that we don't talk aboutyou know burned and burn out and itwould become you know what it was when Iwas young and thought I wanted to becomea doctor which was you know a field thatwas highly respected and everybodywanted to be a part ofso on that noteum thank you all thank you please joinme in thanking Dr Schlosser for his timethank you[Applause]what are you pressing justJordan okayso if I want to goall right hello everyone my name isI want to first thank ashma and Drslasher for Illuminating thatconversation about how generative AI isapplied and used within Health Carenow I want to Pivot a little bit now toLife Sciencesas the global director for Life SciencesSolutions and strategy we could not bemore excited about the potential and theapplication for generative AI in thisspace across the entire value chainsothey are so many applications and I'lljust give you a few ideas of what we canthink about for the futureimagine though for researchfor research you might be able to thinkabout a scientist or a researchertapping into the potential of generativeAI to develop or uncover proteins thatare not found naturally in natureand then being able to further developthose proteins to then be able tofurther develop those proteins tosupport ones that might have moretherapeutic efficiencies or propensitiesin drug developmentimagine being able to use generative Aiand applications and of generative AI todevelop macromoleculesthese researchers for example you coulduse this with uh anti-microbial peptidesif you could use generative AI therethen maybe we could also then use it tochat to tackle the challenge ofantibiotic resistance that's happeningnowfor clinical trials that's a huge topicand clinical trials we can use andpotentially leverage generative AI tohelp with anonymizing and creatingcreating synthetic datapatient privacy and patient data is ofthe utmost importance when it comes toclinical development but it also happensto be one of the most challengingand to that end imagine if you couldleverage generative AI to develop a setofartificial or synthetic data set thatcould be used and anonymized in such away that you would not have you wouldnot be able to take a single data pointand extrapolate that back to a singleper a single individualfor clinical trials you'd be able toincrease that amount of increase thedata sets increase the data as well asincreasing the diversity this could be aboon for the clinical trial space notonly for those who are sponsoringclinical trials but those who areexecuting as well as creating andanalyzing these clinical trialssimilarly on the Imaging and diagnosticsidefor Imaging and Diagnostics you couldstill take these synthetic imagesand be able to use that to feed and feedadditional data sets into what is knownas data hungry machine learning modelsthere's so many other areas that wehaven't even don't have the time totouch upon in the short time that wehave today including manufacturingsupply chain Logistics even commercialapplications when it comes to generativeAi and life sciencesso with that I would like to actuallyturn it over to my colleague GuidoMatthews from Bayer who will actuallytalk a little bit about some of thecurrent applications and how theirorganization is looking at Ai and theapplications of generative AI Guidothank you very much Smita thanks forhaving me yes yes welcomeso my name is KIRO I'm from BerlinGermany I'm heading a functionalRadiology r d within Bayer Imaging dataand AI research center of excellence andwe started a very very productivepartnership with Google roughly fouryears ago yes andwhy Bayer why Google so bear has a veryvery long Heritage over 100 years inmedicine and also we are a leader inradiology and as some of you might knowRadiology is at the Forefront of AIapplications of generative AI activitiesso this is our promise also to ourcustomers to patients fulfilling ourBayer version health for all hunger fornone and from that perspectivewe try to drive together with industryPartners like Google but also to engagewith patient societies and regulatorregulatory authorities to tap into anarea of responsible AIwell tell us a little bit about how isBayer using generative AI right now howare you looking at the AI strategy andhow you're going to be applyinggenerative AI in your organizationso um I would also like to refer on thatquestion what Michael already introducedit's all about data at the end of theday 80of work that has to do with AI comeswith data it's about data catalogingdata Readiness creating Frameworksum like having something that iscompletely Cloud native that was ourfirst starting point when we met Googleto create an environment especially forradiology application development tohave a workbench available that iscompletely Cloud native and thenstructure data have access haveconnectivity have data security veryimportant and since we are a globalplayer in the pharmaceutical world wealso need to comply with a lot ofregional regulatory requirements anddata privacy rules and this is what wetake very very serious and where we alsohave technology Partners like Google athelpbox yeah absolutely so I touchedupon a lot of what is the potentialapplication what is the future what arewhat is one type of generative AI orTrend or use case that you'reparticularly excited aboutso there are many I'm sureum let's focus still on on our Radiologybusiness here it's um vertex AI orvertex generate AI engine that we arevery excited aboutum on the other side matpom is somethingwe're early onum yeah started to exchange on and andto look for use cases and there are twotopicsumon the one side we have the regulatoryframework again that requires a lot ofdocumentation so some of you that mightwork in clinical development mightunderstand that you have huge hugeefforts for document development dataevaluationsubmission reports and so on and soforth and using gen Ai and that field tohelp to deal with that data to make themmore accessible to make more automationavailableto have a report generation think aboutclinical study protocols that need to bewritten that are documents of severalhundred Pages sometimes you have youroutcome reports at the end of a studyall that needs to be generated and thenalso to be transferred to regulatoryauthorities and here we need to partnerup in the ecosystem to make much muchbetter use of the technology we haveagain in a very responsible frame secondPointsynthetic data or artificial degenerateddata is very much important since ofcourse we have a lot of data pointsoutside there's an increase of emergingprocedures overall worldwide the role ofImaging in clinical trials has alsoincreased more than 500 over the lastyears so think about these datamountains that they are out there andthey need to somehow be activated on theother side you have special cases youhave special requirements you reallywould like to make your AI bulletproofbecause at the end of the day it'smeeting a patientand and there's no risk that we shouldshould carry on so thereforesynthetic data generation is somethingthat we are very excited on and that wetry to um yeah explore much much moreand also make this accessible for us butalso for our partners and and theecosystemI think one of the areas isabout a lothas been we don't want to do generativeAI for the sake of generative Ai and theconversation has been around well how doI apply this in my in my organization orwhat can I what can I do so maybe youcan share a little bit about how Bayeris looking what is the goal ofleveraging these use cases forgenerative AI what is the ultimate goalfor Bayerso ultimate goal for us is serving thepatients so it's again helpful hungerfor none and since I'm in thepharmaceutical devotion I'm talking moreon the patient side we have also ourother divisions that also look intoseveral use casesit's Patient First yeah and this in aresponsible way and then also lookinginto the ways how we work in Pharma r dhow we execute how we train Talent howwe create a frameum that is ready for the future andthese are things all around generativeAI that are important but there's oneadditional very important thing with AIand without AI it's it's the Innovationmachine it's the culture of innovationand and really look for breakthroughlook for unmet medical needs and how touse technology and bring this togetherand here againtechnology Partners like Googlepharmaceutical Partners export companiesbut also regulatory authorities we alltogether need to partner up to create aframe also to make AI explainable yeahso that's also something you can havethe nicest tool in your lab you caneasily today much much easier than twothree years ago generated a piece ofcode and and executed and and haveresults that needs to become scalablethat needs to become understandableexplainable and then regulatorybulletproof because at the end it'smeeting a patient and this is whereagain we should not have any risk yeahwellso these are all the use cases how doyou think generative AI is actuallygoing to change the way Bayer Workswhether you're sitting in sales whetheryou're in research or even for yourultimate customers how do you thinkgenerative AI will have this impactso let's talk with a customerperspective firstum here also like like Michael wasreferring to in his talk we have ashortage on well-trained stuff soRadiologists are not given everywhere inthe world at the version capacity sothis is a topic we need to address wehave increasing procedures as Imentioned worldwideso think about that AI is able tosupport the Radiologists in his dailyroutine to have a better workflowefficiency to have maybe diagnosticsupportto have triage options available to toReally Channel which patients are to umhe has or he or she has to look first atum we have the whole topic of um againautomated document generation soreporting comparison treatment decisionstreatment supportdocumentation so this is howum AI will change and hopefully ease upthe way how in clinical practice work isdone on the other side let's move awayback to our in-house r d view here thatumworkflow automation again for ourselvesthe whole topic of document generationand overall data accessibility again soit's all about data the best AI toolwill not work or will not reach as bestperformance if we have data limitationsand herenot just that 80 of data of projects aredelayed that's an industry Benchmark Ithink even wherethe root cause for this delay is dataaccess and data quality so having anenvironmentestablished where you have yourcontinuous data flows available withaccuracy with quality and then even beable to cover gaps with the generationof artificial data so this is what whatwill change our work significantlyso for for those in the audience inparticular who are trying to understandhow they can implement this in their ownorganization what do you think is keyfor you to be able to leverage Ai andgenerative AI in your own organizationso for all from the healthcare Societyagain have your patient in mind what isthat what is the need you try to servefor and then of course technicals comeswhat's the business case behind what'sthe business value you try to generatethen it comesum finally to culture and ReadinessReadiness of AI adaptationum AI execution and that comes againtalent talent development Talentretainment so keeping people upum create excitement allow for failurealso sell a rate failure yeah so notevery every third shoot will be asuccessum and finally The Innovation potentialso create an environment where peopleare empowered where people feelempowered really to innovate try out apivot and execute finally yeah can youshare a little bit one thing that'sunique about the way that we have anopportunity to work with you and and theteam isum you and the IT teams are working veryvery closely together in orders uh inorder to see the success and the successof this partnership can you share alittle bit more about what frameworkyou've given it from a businessperspective how could it decision makersthink about the framework of how toleverage uh generative AIso I think umit's it's similar like all decisionmakers will look at itum so again it's the use case it's theenvironment I try toum to impactum and then overallumsee the advantages of really moving intoa cloud native environment so I I'msorry to say this again but it does nothelp if you start only with small AI usecases here and there to put it somewhereit will work for for these areas but youdon't leverage the full potentialespecially now with having generative AItools available you never will come toreally a flow in that area so thereforeyou need to really move Cloud native andwhatever data source you have catalog itmake it available and If if this Frameis created then I think every nextdecision making to invest maybe in apilot or in the next product developmentis much much easier and much much moresuccessful yeahwonderfulyesterday you had shared with me a statthat I thought was very interestingaround 40 million diagnostic errors thathappen and I think it would be veryinteresting to talk a little bit aboutsome of that work that you're doing thatcould potentially impact those errorrates that you're referencing yeahthat's that's a big topic so again wehave millions millions millions ofprocedures uh worldwide and radiologyand Medical Imagingum and we have high error ratesum and on the other side these errorratesare leading or are coming from shortageof radiologist capacityyou have the typical night shiftsituation you know people are workingalready 20 hours 24 hours and a routineand they got call called up there's aemergency case andsometimes things are overlooked and thatis what we would like to support ourcustomers giving tools at hand thatreally help them that even if they arein a stressful situationum there's a machine like an autopilotin the car these days right that helpsyou a little bit maybe to see the redtraffic light or or to make a betterassessment we have a lot of incidentialfindings so you goum you get a scan an x-ray or MRI andfor a certain reasonum and there's something else that isnot okay in your body and these are thelenser findings can be catched up easilyif we have ai running in the backgroundin the hospital information systemenvironment and detecting the scansscanning over the scans and and maybegive a reportthat again needs a regulatory frameworkthat is safe yeah so it's not just thatwe do everything to do a very very goodand high quality product development butalso we need to understand how we willuse this technology in the future andthat's therefore again the comparisonwith the self-driving cars it's the samewhat happens if the car is crossing thered traffic light and somethingsomething goes wrong so this is what weneed to avoid and therefore it's not aSprint to introduce AI even in Radiologywe see the highest area in Industry onhealthcare for AI application clearancean adaptation but it's more a long-termwalk that we carefully should should dotogether and not become exhausted tooearly right and we talked about doingthis you know methodically and with thehuman in the loop as well so makes makesa lot of senseearlier this year we announced togetherthat uh Bayer is leveraging GoogleCloud's tpus to accelerate drugDiscovery is there anything that youmight be able to share around anyprogress or anything that you'd like toshare with the audience here becausethat made a big splashyesit was a very very good startum and um very exciting areaumsince we have started beginning of theyear of course now we are shortly aftersummer break so the only thing I wouldlike to share today it's a very goodcollaboration and and there's very goodwork and progress yeahum so and againcoming back to the earlier question formaybe decision makers or it decisionmakersexecuting on such pilots and such suchexperimental work is much much easier ifyou already have your cloud readyenvironment produced and can build onthat yeah absolutely and I think that'sone of the pieces of that we're takingaway from our experiences and you knowdiscussions with everyone uh here in theaudience is we can talk about how we canleverage all thisum you know all of this type differenttypes of AI but really there are somefoundational pieces that need to be setin place in order to be ready to do thataround resiliency around cost andfinance it's around thinking about yourscalability your scale your computethinking you know the high performanceComputing resources needed your tpusthat are neededand then even as uh as was sharedearlier keeping in mind around privacysecurityum compliance these are all pieces thatare the foundation of how we how we canactually leverage and work togetherum and really really get the most TheHighest Potential out of uh the usecases that generative AI has to offerum one common theme I'll just kind ofwrap with this is one common theme isI'm hearing around change management andtalent so it's not only about the techfor Tech's sake but it's also about thecultural aspect of bringing everyonealong maybe we can finish with sharing alittle bit about your experience withhow bear has reacted to adopting Ai andany tips that you might have for thosein the audienceyeah sosome of you might imagine that earlydays so years ago not not even a decadebut it was just maybe four or five yeahfive years ago and andumso when when you have really reallybrilliant Innovative scientific medicalMinds meetinguh um also very very Brilliant Mindsfrom technology science yeahum so you need to do translational workbetween themthere's a long long classicalapproach how you do clinical developmentthat worked very nicely look at all themedicine that is out thereum that's that's coming out of thesevery professional machineand now ai is introducing in new waysit's requiring ways so you can reallysee and feel yeah things are gettingmaybe faster or more accurate evensometimes and and it's easier to workwithsome tools so you need to change thatyou need to bring these differentdisciplines together and that takes timeand that also is a need to allow forfailureit's setting up agile Frameworks whereyou also bring the right people and veryvery often it's it's the case that thebetter you prepare the more time youinvest before you start a project tobring the people together to clarifyrequirements and expectations then thebetter the execution runs and at the endof the day that comes back to creatingempowered teams and and Frameworks in anage environmentwonderfulwell with that I think we'll wrap thisup I appreciate all of you for theirtime and taking the precious time hereto be with us today and thank you Guidofor sharing about the Fantasticpartnership that we have and sharingyour experiences and knowledge witheveryone here thank you thanks everyoneforeign"
