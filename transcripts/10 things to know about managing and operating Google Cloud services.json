    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good morning good morning everybodythanks for comingtoday we're going to share some of ourexperiences and and talk about sort of10 things to know about managing andoperating services in in Google Cloudso I'm Preston Holmes I'm a productmanager in Google Cloud I've actuallybeen here maybe close to nine years nowand prior to that in Amazon so I've beenin the public Cloud space over a decadeand have seen and helped quite a fewcustomersmove from various circumstances on thecloud and so that's my perspective on onthese 10 points and I have ROMhey everyone good morning how are youhope you all having a great next sessionuh thanks for attending our session myname is Ram gogrini I'm a principal SREarchitect at Charles Schwab responsiblefor the entire observability strategyand implementation uh I mean day-to-dayI work with several asari teams intaking care about high availability ofour applications or resiliency what notentire sorry things will be running withall our partnersso when you look at the cloud sort ofthe journey to the cloud right it'salways going to be a little bitmysterious and I kind of make an analogyto Parenting so any of you that areparents know that there's simplyunknowable challenges that are in thefuture and that you're never going to beprepared ultimately for the challengesthat come you simply need to be adaptiveand respond and learn as you go and andthis is true of the cloud journey Ithink most organizations uh set outthinking they are going to make a planand that the plan will in advance takecare of every sort of foreseeable thingbut the truth is it's still a very largeand very complicated process butdocumentation the training all thesethings help but at the end of the daythere's going to be no substitute forthe uniqueness of your journeyyeah as I said I'm from Charles Schwabhere is a little bit about uh Schwab andwho is Schwab what swap doesand uh yeah I'd like to you know take towhat person is saying about the cloudjourney is complicated definitely it iscomplicated but you know the more youstart doing into the journey right youknow with the best principles and allthat stuff it gets better and currentlySchwab runs a variety of criticalworkloads uh you know that ranging fromdata to already gke workloads anythingthere are several workloads runningCloud uh however you know as we startedinitially the journey will be tough uhlike any other thing as it involvesseveral stakeholders you know from yourdevelopment team QA networking everybodythe first thing is making sure everybodyis onboarded to the same Mission okayeverybody together on this journey andalsouh in the strategy making sure you'reidentifying the right application uh forthe migration on the beginning from theapplication identification all the wayto your last my love how do you uh youknow Obama migrate from either from datacenter or from other Cloud partner tothe complete the last mile so that'swhere first you need to buy in theentire stakeholders also I mean don'tassume that your first architecturalblueprint or document would be the onethat is going to the production right aspart of the journey you need to reviewand see what are the trade-offs betweenthe applications what needs to be done Imean for example you know nowadays allthese uh microservices run either on youknow if you want going in gcp you maychoose to run either Cloud run or gkeyou may start with Cloud run and thenyou know depends on the workload notnecessarily you don't have to go to gkebut Cloud run so the whole point is yougot to be flexible be agile and learn asyou go on the ability to change yourstuff so on the Fly that will enable youto accept the strategy you write andhave a methodical approach on how entiremigration it could be a data it could beyou know application stack everythingneed to be together for a successfulCloud migration Journeytoday as part of that I came here toshare uh some of the learnings for oneof our the critical application wehosted in gcp is called a clientauthentication applicationwe have a suite name called cake okayclient authentication in Cloudso what it does is you know theauthentication uhit authenticates a multi-millions oflogins every monthand it has a several you know based onthe workloads right he has a peak if youlook at some of the retailers they mayhave uh Peaks during the holiday seasonand yesterday I attended a papasanthtalk they're talking about Freddy's aretheir peaks right Friday evenings aretheir Peak however for swab every daythe morning during the market open andevening of the market close those areour Peak workloads so we got to be readyto support what are the peak we aregetting so that's one of the reason youknow for the agility elasticity also thescaling we chose gke as our coreapplication architecture and our abilityto run you know across the workloads inmulti region set up and all that stuff Iwould like to spend a little bit more onthis diagram which has more inferencesin you know of the topicif you look at here uh the entire gkerunning in gcp there also there are aswe are in the journey uh not necessarilyuh we're able to migrate everything tothe cloud once it's a journey right someyou know still running on on-prem so wetalk to the on-prem services the datacenter Services also if you look at thedown the logswe made an architectural change in sucha way that uh given this hybrid workloadmode uh some Cloud native as well assome on-prem we are bringing all theselogs together to gcp to take theadvantage of in the scale of gcp so thatwe can get a single pane of monitoringglass View and ability to identify theissues quickly and all that stuff sothose are the couple of the high levelarchitectural pointsumthis slide is very busy or slide inreality but it's stripped up in order toshow the high level stuff so yeahgreatso we're going to now kind of talk about10 things and these aren't we weactually the original title of this talkwas the top 10 things and we took theword top out right because we're notgoing to presume to rank and order theseThese are 10 things that in ourconversations we thought would besomething interesting to share aboutsome aspect of what we've learnedmatters or doesn't matter in this andwe're going to take sort of a a formatto each of these things and what it'llstart with is just a general quickstatement of what the topic is and andin in sort of a cloud vendor agnosticway all right then I'll try to talk alittle bit about what I see as some ofGoogle Cloud'sopinions or best practices or maybe someof the lesser-known elements again itwon't be comprehensive we're not goingto cover each of these topics to theirNth Degree and then Ron will talk a bitabout Schwab's own opinions at acompany-wide level as a cloudorganization how they look at that topicand then we'll use that application hejust described to talk about howparticular decisions get made all theway down sometimes at that applicationby application Levelso the first is going to be resourcehierarchy now any Cloud vendor is goingto be largely infrastructure via apisright it's an API driven system andthese apis create resources theseresources are always grouped or boundtogether into some sort of containmentsystem these might be workspaces orprojects or foldersin some places they might be just byaccount so how these Cloud resources areorganized and grouped together isusually something that is deeplyingrained into the way any given Cloudvendor presents its products and thesechoices that you make about how youorganize your company's usage of cloudin that resource hierarchy is often avery sort of permanent and foundationaldecision in other words it's notsomething you easily want to go back andchange two years later about how yousort of embrace a given resourcehierarchyat gcp our resource hierarchy reallystarts with a cloud organization andmost companies have a single Cloudorganization as part of their usage ofgcp there are larger companies wherethey have say very large Acquisitions ordivisions that operate more as asubsidiary where they might use multiplecloud orgsand then within the organization we havefolders and the folders are really justnodes of a hierarchy they don't reallyhave much other than as a point ofattachment for things like policy andthen the real atom of the gcp resourcemodel is the project and the project isthe thing that contains a cloud resourceevery cloud resource every product makesthings happen in Cloud projects and thishierarchy is something that you can useto attach things like policy to thathave inheritance down to the to thelower levels of the resource hierarchyand so how you use folders andorganizations and how you use those toattach policy we'll talk about policy abit more later is really key to sort ofhow you choose to use gcpabsolutely Preston now in gcp Worldproject is the key right all theresources are in the project we dofollow the similar approach uh kind ofthe same Approach at an org level offolders and projects also the way ourprojects or organized it's more abusiness component level right businesstransaction uh the same influence we cango back to client authentication whichis made up of several logical uhServices made up of authentication theyare all grouped into one application IDliterally we call it as a applicationportfolio management based on the APM IDthe projects are created and these arefollowed through all the way fromsandbox all to end QE all the way to theproduction that's the approach wefollowed and also everything is driventhrough terraform it's easy to create aproject and the trade on a project andat some point if I need an additionalproject for do some testing right orsomething else needed is kind of so onefull request you will be able to spin upa project quickly and I am done withthat project then you can tear it downso there is a lot of flexibility the wayhow Google organizes the projects andalso the resources within the project aswell so it's very helpfulnow when it comes to sort of structuringpermissions and policy you know I thinkthis is uh again any Cloud vendor isgoing to have mechanisms and tools forthis at the end of the day this isreally about trying to find the balancebetween control and sort of flexibilityand permission to be you know productivein whatever you do and that is abalancing act you can overdo this if yousort of over apply overly complexpermissions and policy it can become aburden for the workforce right but soit's a balancing act between those twoI'd also like to kind of be you know alittle bit of a soapbox around some ofthe security features in thatoverly complex security setup can be asecurity anti-pattern in my opinionmeaning if you have a security set upthat very few people can reason about ormake sense of that actually becomesomething that is very hard to monitorwhether it's doing what you want to doand so we have in-cloud vendors manytools and many capabilities and thoseshould be applied sort of in theappropriate ways where they apply so nowin gcp we predominantly have two maindialects around this we have IM which isreally around resource access andpermissions and that really Gates usageof the API on the different products andservices and then we have organizationalpolicy and organizational policy isreally more around capturing the intentof governance and management aroundpractices and guidance around how to useproducts and both of those can attach tothe resource hierarchy we generallybelieve that you should structure thingslike permission around roles rather thanalways around individuals this makesmanaging thepermission of individuals easier becauseyou're talking about membership of agroup rather than having to kind of keeptrack of individual policies of I amapplied to individualsumlastly you know there's always going tobe some choice about that sharedresponsibility with the gcp as acustomer so for example we do offer manymanaged security features that I thinkare advantageous for Outlet to letGoogle do sort of the management ofsecurity things like keys but we doallow you to do things like bring yourown Keys through customer managedencryption keys and this is all aboutpicking some choice you have on a trustboundary with Google so you may trustGoogle more to manage keys or if youwant to do more of the key managementyourself and take more of that burden onyou can use something like the thecustomer manage encryption key so thoseare all choices you need to make aroundan adoption of a security model with thecloud vendor because it'll always be ashared responsibility modelthank you so you know if you are intothe very early stages of thegcp interval the IAM could beoverwhelming and daunting you know it'svery confusing also to start with youknow what are the different permissionsneeds to be applied which groups youknow layers and all that stuffyou know after a while they definitelyonce you get a hang of you know then youknow exactly how these are works but thebest practice is you know we do followalso you know industry level will be thead groups uh based on the project youmay need a different groups of usersright you know some could be in needonly the viewer role access some couldbe the editor role suppose a securityteam or a team they need only the vieweraccess right all these managed via thead groups now the groups has you knowrequired people suppose you know 4qpeople will be one group a developerwill be another one sret will be inanother group so that's why you set upyour own group and also create theappropriate roles in that group that wayyou know you have the right roles set upin that group one other thing you knowwe truly believe that the the privilegeof least privileged access for any groupright you don't need then what is trulyneeded to perform that job so just wantto make sure uh the required permissionsleast privilege access is given to anygroup so that you know the entiresecurity posture can be managed verywellso we're going to talk about quotas nowquotas are not anyone's favorite thingin general I think quotas are somethingthat in systems now we have quotasinternally internal systems all theGoogle all also use quotas this is notsomething just externalized in sort of acloud services space and they're reallyto protect everyone from unforeseenusage at the end of the day I think thekey thing with quotas is to be proactiveand and in their management and not bereactive when you start running intoissues now that means being familiarwith the nature of them becausedifferent quota systems apply todifferent products using different kindof measurements of a window so somequotas are sort of based on a pureabsolute number other quotas are moretime based so being familiar with eachproduct you're using in the nature ofthe quotas in gcp many quotas areactually Auto approved based on your ownsort of usage of cloud if you're ifyou're sort of a good uh likelong-standing user of cloud and you'repaying your bills Etc you haveessentially a lot of your quotas will beAuto approved other quotas do requirehuman reviewand it's important for you to monitorthe consumption of quotas so that youcan be proactive ahead of the time theymight come up now the final thing I'llsay is that any significant largeproject like you know when we're dealingwith a very large retailer around BlackFriday or broadcast around a majorsporting event these always sort of willrequire some degree of conversation withan account team we often set up verycollaborative sort of uh you know alarge event management teams to makesure we're doing the right kind of loadtesting and capacity planning Etc so thethe day-to-day usage of quotas is sortof one thing around this sort of ongoingproactive measurement and then I'll sayspecial events require special attentionand that's absolutely something we dothanks Preston and always the quotas areyou know an interesting topic so on howthese will play a role so um I think uhyou know the in the early stages of yourdevelopment and all right you should beable to identify what is the trulyrequired quota for each service for yourcritical workloads in production supposeyou know I may be I need to run thesemany logins per minute in that right sothat what are the different things weneed to be making sure maybe the loggingAPI you know bigquery or any VMS or GKright all these quotas do play a roleand if you go to the Google Cloudconsole there are 13 300 or somethingservices available where you canconfigure the quotas so it is very hardto know right which one to pick which 10I need to set the quotas the way we planwas and we did was in our lowerenvironment when you run this uh theperformance test that's how you knowright what is the scale you need to runthis application then you run theperformance test and to the scale whatyou needed and go back and look at yourquotas right okay where are my quotasaround this also you may put somethreshold about that I always like toknow when my quotas are approachingaround 70 or 80 percent and then createan alert on top of those right that wayalso there are a better dashboardsavailable for quota management as wellbut the key is identifying the requiredquotaI can take a couple of examples you knowreal life where we you know see it andalso later we found it for example if wetake the bigquery and bigquery has theuh as by default there is no it hasunlimited uh data query for a day rightthere is no limited bigquery usage perday I mean one way it is good so thatyou know is Nothing is Stopping butreally not sure right unless say likeyou have hundreds of users each one isusing to an extent then that will add upyour quota so and also there is one morelevel deep uh deeper there is a bigqueryusage per user per day say like you have100 users each one is using like 100terabytes then that will quickly add upright so depends on the use case whatyou're trying to do you may want toclearly look into the quotas for eachservice and configure appropriately thatway uh accidentally you won't run intouh impose your application stopping yourapp location in the middle of doingsomething or you know adding more costto it so always quotas needs to bereviewed monitored and alerted that wayyou have right way to manage themforeignwe'll talk now about log management sologging is obviously probably the theoldest form of application monitoring Imean everyone who starts developmentstarts with some level of printdebugging and those become logs and thenlogs become more sophisticated over timethere's never been more logging as thereis today and I think each day thatbecomes a you know an equally truestatementso not only is there more logs beinggenerated from more sources but logs arechanging in their nature so one is thatlogs are increasingly highly structuredand structured logs provide a muchricher source of information about thesystems that they are loggingalso logs are becoming increasinglyuseful Beyond Simple operations so logshave a lot of information that areincreasingly relevant to the businessand the products that they're associatedwith and soyou know the origins of bigquery in manyways at Google were about our internallogging problem how do we manage logs atscale at Google when you had the firstsort of iterations of Google where wewere getting into hundreds of thousandsof servers and so in Google we do have alot of Tools around centralizing andstoring logs and that's often ourrecommendation ROM has done a lot inthis space I'm going to let ROM talkmore about what Schwab's done all rightthank you president you might need towarn me now either logging ortroubleshooting I will keep going andtalking for hoursso definitely logging yeah you know it'sa very interesting topic umas you start running your workloads itproduces various types of logs systemlogs application logs networking logsVPC logs right you got to be realunderstanding what are the differentlogs that's coming to your project andwhat is the true needed logs needs to bein your project first identify the logssuppose your application is chatty it isthat I am writing so many logs you maynot have enough time to fix it buthowever the way you would do is you knowonce it comes to the project you knowfrom the log sync you can drop the logsor unwanted logs so first key isidentify the required logs if you takeabout the VPC logs you know it has tonsof logs obviously they do some rate ofsampling even on top of it it producetons of logs so if you are not carefulabout it you know slow it will fasteradd up your log buckets will increasealso it will add up so much of cost aswell so first key is identify therequired logs uh then drop The Unwantedlogs not evensecond one is how do you manage your loglife cycle okay I know what are the logsI need it to be then how do you keepthem right you know maybe there aredifferent purposes for these logs onecould be for operational fortroubleshooting some may need a lifetimeof either 30 days or 60 days that is thedefault Google provider 60 day in in thecloud console and later maybe forvarious reasons could be for auditpurpose or for the analytical reasonsand all you may want to find the targetstate of these logs some can go to GCSsome may go to bigquery if you chose theroute for GCS for audit purpose orsomething then you need to identify whatis the long term strategy right do Ineed to bring them very often or it cango to the cold storage versus near timereal bucket and all that stuff alsouh if uh the the policy of your sortingthe logs is more of an analytical reasonbigquery would play a greater role hereespecially you can store them also bringas needed with some other analyticaltools on top of it so you know when wedid some comparison right you know Ithink with the big bigquery comparisonavailable and all that stuff the costalso in a GCS and uh bigquery there isnot much of a a difference so you canuse that as well uh alsonow one other thing I would like to talkabout is you know all these uh microServices they may span across theprojects so then on your services is inone project and you are consuming fewother services across the project thenhow do you get the common visibilityinto these projectsso the approach we took was you knowcreating the a common logging projectwhere all the logs would go to onecentralized lightning project that wayyeah you would have an access to theprojects also those logs can becontrolled via the log views uh supposea project a not necessarily havingaccess to the other logs in the projecthowever they may sum this can becontrolled via the IIM permissions logviews also you would be able torestrict some of the logs even at a logfield level restriction as well so thatway logs plays a critical role in thisentire Cloud migration journey and allso definitely a lot of thought needs tobe put in place for proper logmanagement and life cycle of itthanksnow closely related to to sort oflogging in the soft space istroubleshooting one of the challengesoften in in a in a cloud platform introubleshooting is you do have limitedvisibility into the internals of some ofthe systems you're using right so it'soften important to recognize that ifsomething is going wrong sometimes thefirst place you need to check is thevendor status dashboard right because itmight be that there's a a product leveloutage or something degraded now I willadmit something the way any vendor isexposing something on their statusdashboard is based on a threshold andbecause products don't simply go offlinealways in an All or Nothing way youoften have degraded conditions in acloud service that do not make it to thestatus dashboard because you might havea condition where you have say fourpercent of customers who happen to be inthis part of a data center who happen tobe trying to do one operation on thatproduct or hitting an issue right thatkind of degradation usually doesn't riseup to a status dashboard and that can befrustrating if you were seeing a problembut it's not listed on a status thingand that's really where if if you havethe support team and you have theconnection with support support can lookinto your projects and your resourcesand help clarify whether you might bebeing impacted by what is sort of a subthreshold condition Within product soknow that that is that is one optionsort of beyond the status dashboard ifyou have the right kind of support tierwhen it comes to understanding the rootcause I really just sort of want to usethis moment to be a proponent ofdistributed tracing right when you havecomplex data paths going throughmultiple Cloud products in your ownpotentially multiple Cascade ofmicroservices and you're seeing an endcondition of hey we're seeing a reallyslow response times whyasking that question why is this certainservice slow is usually about decide orDrilling in and figuring out which partof the 12 to 15 things it might be doingis potentially most contributing to thatslowness and distributing distributedtracing while it does take a prettysignificant investment to put in placeto instrument the code is by far one ofthe best ways to seewhere in this call Path latency might beintroducedthanks Preston for our deep insights uhyeah troubleshooting is uh my daily uhone of my favorite topic soand as you said right depend in theinitial day itself our architecture uhgiven we have workloads running hybridworkloads uh Cloud native as well as youknow some to the on-prem as well thearchitectural choice we made was tobring all the logs into gcp to take theadvantage of our scale of gcp so then weare having all of our logs uh includingour our logs AS application logs as thecorrelation IDs all that stuffeverything is in one central place nowwhich is in the gcp cloud operations inthe log buckets analyticals and bigqueryso the key idea here is how quickly youcan identify the issue like you know thequicker mttd and mttr those are the keythings right the you should have anability to for your SRE teams andquickly identify the detect the issueand the ability to take an action sothat you can restore the system quicklyso the approach we follow you know kindof from several years uh we are doingthe same thing our data center as wellthe same principles were being applyingeach of our critical or any service wemonitor those sres Google and signalslatencies traffic errors and saturationrate and we built our SRE team did aphenomenal job in building severaldashboards you know which has thesegolden signals and the approach we tookwas is kind of a three layer we havethese business metrics applicationmetrics and infrastructure metrics maybelet's take a step back what are thebusiness metrics why do we need that oneokay your entire system is built to do abusiness function is it really doingwhat is supposed to doing so uh yet atany given point of time I'm interestedin how my authentication app is workinghow many logins it is authenticating arehow quick it is doing and what is thepeak rate how can I go back and lookback what is my yesterday's login ratescompared to Prior week or somethingright these are all the differentbusiness metrics we should be able tobring it back to your dashboard and thenif we go another level is theapplication metric in order to providethat business value how my applicationis performing uh what is the latencyeach user is experiencing how are theerror rates are working or you know inany other creation is happening in theapplication those are all driven throughthe application dashboards and one morelevel is the infrastructurethat's where the saturation comes in aCPU memory error rates and all thatstuff so to get into one common viewwith all these three metrics and give aquick view for any SRE engine needs orourcommand level control people like youknow able to quickly identify and thenyou know take next steps so we builtseveral log based metrics given we arebringing all the logs into the gcp uhentire gcp is driven off of the metricsseveral log based metrics were builtwhich ported to the dashboards and eachdashboard or in the metric is tied to anSLO which has internally has slis andall that stuff so given through thisslower monitoring also you know thecritical alerts are created which willgo to our level one Command Center andall that stuff you know create adirectly paging and all that stuff so inin that I know we have an ability to uhyou get a lot of alerts sometimes youknow when you are into the early stagesof the journey especially when youchanging the monitoring tools rightsuppose you know you have the on-premhave one tool and then move to the gcpyou may using different tools also inthe beginning days of Journey you mayput more threshold ranges that way youknow you are monitoring sometimes therecould be aggressive sometimes you knowlittle more relaxed so there will be alot of noise in the alerts to begin withbut you got to be you know looking tothe carefully and you know soon adjustthose alert threshold that way you havethe right alert signal to face able todo quick actionable and don't want toget caught into the uh you know alertnoise or alert fitting all that stuffthat's another thing helping us also youknow I want to give credit to the Googleteam as well in the last two yearsthere's a lot of improvements done inthe Google Cloud operation suitespecially the logs Explorer also thelog analytics is the one which is stillgrowing but you know there are a lot offeatures coming in the log analyticswhere you don't need to really go intothe bigquery but from the logs consoleitself ability to do the queries as welland uh all of our logs today they go tobigquery as well for analytical purposetoo and we do use the log sync to getthat one but however you know giventhere are some challenges you know theway how you the logs will go to the fromthe log Explorer to the bigqueryit will identify the first record setsthe schema some of the issues withchallenges so log analytics is the onesolving those so with the combination ofyou know the planet scale of some ofthese Google tools and the great workfrom our SRE team with the principles ofwhat we're adhering to helping us totroubleshoot the issue and able to youknow run this scale of application thecritical application without anyincidents and all that stuffall right we're gonna say a few thingsabout cost management and and I'll startwith saying that cost managementcontinues to be difficult on the cloud Ithink first and foremost this is reallybecause the models in the way cloud isbuilt for largely in these sort ofmetered and consumption-based patternsis very different from the way mostcompanies Finance systems operate interms of procurement and budgeting andplanning and so there's there's a lot ofthings thatum you know when moving applications tothe cloud means adopting to how you'regoing to plan forecast and model thecost of given application which may havemany many dimensions across differentparts of the cloud such as networkstorageEtcone of the key things in terms of how wesee companies modernizing the way theyapproach cost management is to reallyadopt this process of finopsum this idea of operating and automatingmore of the way you manage and monitorand analyze costs right so in gcp onething that has been a good practice fora long time is to use tagging onresources that you can use the way ofaggregating resource billing toparticular projects or business unitsEtc so tagging is extremely useful alsoall of our billing data when we've beentalking about the types of logging andanalytics you can do is also exportableto bigquery right for where you canbuild dashboardsEtc and then finally I'll just say thatwhen when buildingcomplex applications on cloud there'sreally almost no substitution forrunning the load tests of what it wouldlook like to actually run theapplication and then using that as asnapshot to do an approximation of whatyour billing will be at a given sort ofusage of volumeyeah thank you definitely costs you knowwe got to be really cognizant about whatkind of workloads you're running incloud and how they are running and alsowhy they are running right nowespecially in the early stages of youknow we're still in that uh on-prem datacenter maybe how many of you can recallthe last time when you I'm adecommissioned a server because you arenot really in use right I mean we let itgo are it's not our problem somebodywill take care about you knowdecommission the server because we arenot paying and somebody else is notpaying right so here you got to bereally understanding about what are theworkloads running why they are runninghow they are running have you knowcomplete monitoring on those uh Googlehas a good way to monitor uh you knowthe cost as well based on the skus yourcomponents using how much is thebigquery compute and all that stuff alsoif needed there are third party tools asit supports with the billing API and allyou're able to get into one common placeif you have to come here with theon-prem versus all these costs the wayhow I feel is you know once you onboardto any public Cloud it's like you'regetting intoa you know olderness taxi which isrunning a meter on right unless as youare on the car the meter keep running hecan't sit on the car and forget rightsimilarly you have to you know keeptracking and what is running and theability to most of the time you startyour development in a sandbox orsomething and you move on you may notnecessarily stop it he keeps adding onit soalso you know you may start running someworkloads in production maybe how toreally analyze and observe it do youtruly need it to run that scale orsomething or there are opportunities tooptimize like you know schedule scalingversus pre-scalingum you know sometimes need a peak loadat a certain point of time the rest ofthe day would be very normal you may notneed it so all these things needs to beconsidered you got to remembereverything what you're running or planto run has a cost to it nothing is freein Cloudthat's goodall right so this one is sort of aninteresting grab bag and that is that inin adopting Cloud architectures there'soften going to be trade-offs in yourapplication in other words people oftensay they want you know the lowestlatency with the highest durability withthe you know the greatest degree ofresiliency but there are trade-offs inthe way you design these systems andsometimes they require balance I thinkit's always important to make thesechoices based on your users experiencewhether that's an internal user or anexternal user in other words there aresome experiences that don't require thefastest latency you know do you needsomething to be responsive within 100milliseconds if it's a batch dataprocessing job probably notin this area when it comes to resiliencyone important thing in gcp is torecognize that different products havedifferent sort of geographic default uhdistributions in the way they aremanaged so there are some Cloudresources which are inherently zonalsome that are Regional and some that aremulti-regional and so as you're buildingyour system recognizing which model eachproduct is sort of adopted in the wayit's automatically managing resiliencyis important that you kind of don'tbuild a system that say uses threeregional components and one zonalcomponent because now your whole systemis going to be only as resilient as itsleast resilient componentumyeah thank you person I would like tospend just a quick thing on theresiliency so the way how we approachthis was uh I mean the based around thecriticality of our application rightinternally we have an operational riskrating uh all our apps are categorizedyou know what is the risk or you knowthe critical application and all basedaround that or architecture is said okayyou need to run in a multi-region youknow multi-zonal setup that way youwould be able to at any given point oftime our goal is to be able to solvethis application the peak loads from asingle region are also within a singlezone so I mean that way you know we arefault all right you know unless it istruly needed we don't want to go to youknow the Dr Zone all this something insome cases you have a you know amulti-region workloads also running youknow active active some could be youknow active on warm standby all thatstuff but the goal here is you know youhave a resiliency built into it at aregional level also at a Zona levelability to support the workloadso um we'll move along pretty quickly Ithink we've got a few more to come yeahso the this one is really just torecognize that when you are moving froma traditional environment to the cloudthat data and the choices in databasesand things like that are really wide andopen right I think a lot of systems inthe past have assumed that there's adatabase and that's going to be aone-size-fits-all database and allapplications are built on that databasein the cloud you have many choices whenit comes to data and really a singleapplication might use multiple databasesystems depending on the particular userjourney within that application that isbeing served so my point here is to sortof embrace that recognize that differentfacets of an application might benefitfrom different types of data productsand to pick the right one for the rightjob within an applicationyeah I totally agree you know we did thesame thing you know based around thetrue need and use case we adopted youknow to the data diversity and all youknow several databases also cachingcomponents all that stuff also foranalytics we use the bigquery there isone of the way you know based on theneed in the past you know our analyticsare done in the monitoring tool now theyare moved to you know the planet scalebigquery that's where you take you knowavailable product and the approach asneededsoum as as a as a company is embracing acloud the cloud itself becomes this veryvast source of information both from ananalytics point of view as well as anoperationalum like event driven point of view somany of the cloud products and Cloudsystems like I had mentioned thatbilling itself can generate queries ROMhas talked about things like VPC logsthese all provide a lot of informationin the way you're using the cloud andand should be analyzed the same way yourapplication is analyzed for performancethe other thing is that in gcp we have asystem called event Arc which isgenerating events for every audited logand in the future this will actually begenerating events for almost any APIoperation and soautomating and sort of treating this asa programmable Cloud itself is a greatway to adopt maybe new types ofarchitectures that you may not even yetbe adopting in your application such asevent-driven architecturesdoing that for your Cloud operations isa great place to become more effectiveand more efficient in the way you'reusing cloudthere are several opportunitiesavailable you know to take the advantageof the truly the Automation Way rightyou know each event driven you know thendo something something right you knowit's all kind of you know to keep yoursystem in up to date all that stuff alsouh taking the opportunities say forexample we have you know all of our datais coming to bigquery including you knowmetrics uh how the system is performingthe one thing we are looking at is youknow how do you know Cloud provide us torun the cloud right you know thecapacity on Demand right capacity it'scalled how to identify the requiredcapacity so since the data is inbigquery we are exploring how to do someof these models like the standard arimamodel or the battery categorizationmodel or something that should tell uswhat is the capacity I needed to run myapplication for the next week versusnext month or the peak loads and allthat stuffthere's a lot to come under frontand finally we have um how to learneffectively you know we talked at thebeginning that the cloud journey isalways going to involve extensiveamounts of ongoing learning so a few ofsort of the things I've pulled out totalk about here is one really make sureat Google Cloud you can learn a lotabout the way all products work bylearning about the way we design andbuild apis so we've got a lot of publicdocumentation about things like grpcprotocol buffers and even our ownAPI design guidelines are publiclypublished so kind of learning that oncegives you a lot of learning of allcurrent and future products at gcp thesecond is make sure your teams have theability and freedom to learn andexperiment you have to be able toexperiment to learn the way a productworks to make sure people have access tothings like test projects andexperimental projects you know supporthackathons and fun things to do to trynew things with new Cloud products inyour organization and lastly as somebodywho's now actually involved in the theduet a myself I'll say you know takeadvantage of AI to help assist summarizeand find answers to problems when andwhere you need them because you can losea lot of time you know switching out ofwhat you're doing to go chase down a setof documentation and we're really tryingto make AI something that can bring theanswer of what you need to know at theplace you need to know itI agree learning plays a critical rolein any Cloud Journey unless yourresources are really learned and know onwhere they are need to operate rightotherwise it's very hard in the journeyso as president mentioned there areseveral Google resources available greatdocumentation a dollar per blocks uhalso thethe case studies from the customersright if somebody's already figured outhow to run a gke at scale probably youdon't need to spend so much of cycles oftime or get an abstract and see how youcan apply to that and also another thingis you know a learning entire gcp itholistically helps then you knowlearning it small bits of it uh onething our leadership encouraged slashmandated was you know everybody in theproject you know ability to get thecertification yeah the cloud engineer orgcp certification all that stuff thatalso helped usI myself got like two certificationslast year on that path so that's reallyone you know good way to learn and takeprogress into the next thingsall right with that thank you all forcoming yeahyeah so I would like to take one lastminute you know as I said the cloudjourney is definitely very complicatedit takes a mountain of people you knowto run this so I would like to take youknow uh one quick minute to thank eachand everyone from our swap team uhincluding from our executive managementleadership we have our great architectsin place if you are our management isalready here you know with all the helpsfrom all the teams we are able tocomplete this migrated this criticalapplication I'm just happened to be onehere but there is an army of peoplebehind this to making its verysuccessful thank you excellent we're outof time where we are available in thehallway if anyone has any questionsthank you so muchforeign"
