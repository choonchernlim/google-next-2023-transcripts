security services includingsecurity Command Center and I'm joinedtoday by Vandy who leads a team ofproduct managers that are focused onsecurity Command Center posturegovernance and complianceso in this talk we're going to discusswhat we consider to be the fiveindispensable technologies that you needto use for securing your Google Cloudestatewe're going to along the way talk aboutthe capabilities that security CommandCenter offers in these various areas andwe'll highlight some of the latestreleases and new innovations that we'vedelivered over the past several monthsand even some that we've announced justthis week at nextso I'll try to keep things moving so wehave a chance to take a few questionstowards the end so let's go ahead andjump inso we'll start just a quick preview ofwhat we're going to talk about todaywhich are those five indispensableindispensable Technologies we're goingto cover we're going to start by talkingabout technologies that help you tolimit your exposure to risk this isthings like proper resourceconfiguration vulnerability managementpermissions and identities now we'retalking about Dynamic Cloud environmentsso it's not uncommon for there to be alarge number of posture andvulnerability findings in thoseenvironments so we're going to move onto talk about how attack exposure can beused to assess risk and prioritizeremediation of those issuesfinally we're going to wrap things upwith technologies that help you todetect attacks targeting your Cloudenvironments helping you to stay aheadof the rapidly changing threat landscapeso I want to talk for just a momentabout these common issues top of Mindconcerns that we hear from customersjust like youversus is just this essential questionabout what is running in your Cloudenvironments and are those environmentsvulnerable to attackthey seem like they would be relativelystraightforward questions but in thecloud that's just not the casethat this is an environment whereresources are changing all the timethey're being spun up and spun down themanagement of these Cloud environmentsis often not centrally managed within anI.T organization as it is in someon-prem environments it's distributed tovarious workload owners that exist invarious parts of the organizationthere's this essential question about amI under attacka bit challenging their new attacktactics techniques and in some cases newobjectives that attackers are goingafterunderstand how to meet their complianceobligations you know many companies arejust no longer willing to block theirCloud adoption on compliance regulationsand they're tasking their cloud andtheir Cloud security teams with findinga way to effectively Monitor and reporton the compliance of these Cloudenvironmentssecurity Command Center is reallydesigned to address these top of Mindconcerns for customers it providesvisibility into this ever-changing setof assets continuously monitors forthese assets for misconfigurationsidentifies vulnerabilities and assessesthe risk exposure it monitors formalicious activity and unauthorizedaccess to detect active threatsfinally it provides out of the boxcompliance mapping and reporting toenable you to meet your compliancerequirementsto gather into one Central Tool thatprovides visibility across your entiregcp estate andaccurate lifecyclethe days are powered by Google insightsInnovations and expertise securityCommand Center leverages the best ofGoogle threat intelligence for cloudsecurity use cases provides actionableaccurate and timely detections ofthreats by leveraging mandate threatintelligence and uppercasethis a unique set of knowledge that wehave into attackers threats exploits andactivitiesit has generative AI built in using SECPalm Ai and ml to analyzerisk to improve detections to makeoperations more efficientand it analyzes vast amounts of of datato derive these meaningful insights intothreats risks and and surfaces the mostcritical issues and it can help upskillnovice security users and make SecurityExperts even more productiveso I'd like to pause for just a momentand take a quick poll of the audienceI'd like to see a folks raise their handif they have not heard about Google AIthis week[Laughter]no no handsthe prize we're pretty excited here atGoogle about the innovations that we'redriving and generative Ai and personallyI'm just super excited about thepotential that this has to help us solvesome of our hardest security challengesfinally we have now mandent which ispart of Google which brings us Frontlineexpertise to help you mitigate threatsand respond to an incident should oneoccur and we can take the learnings fromthese engagements with customers toimprove our security products andservices including security CommandCenterVandy who's going to kick off our topfive list with a look at technologiesthat help you to start and stay securewhoathanks Sarah so I'm really excited tostart with our first set of technologiesthat is going to really help you andEmpower you to prevent misconfigurationsof your resources and continuouslydetect those misconfigurations so let'sjump into itone of the first things you need to beable to do to protect your resources formisconfigurations is to actually havevisibility into your assetsand you know as Sarah talked aboutearlier you can't have you can't securewhat you can't see and within securityCommand Center we have an amazing assetsview that gives you real-time visibilityinto your assets this includes yourresources like buckets and identitiesand whatnot but also your policieswithin the asset view you can look atthe Historical changes and act on anyunauthorized changes by your teamsyou're also able to see a Consolidatedview of findings and security findingsfor your assets and act on some of thosefindings for your critical assets hereso check it out within the securityCommand Center assets View and I'll diveinto it in just a minute in our demosso now as those resources are gettingconfigured and modified in yourenvironment we being the cloud providerwe know in real time whether or notthey've been configured securely orinsecurelyresult of this we have hundreds ofout-of-the-box detectors to catch any ofthose misconfigurations in real timeswe've integrated deeply with a number ofGoogle cloud services as you can seehere storage networking firewallsidentities your compute instances andwe're able to detect them in real timeanother great thing is you've done allthis hard work you've configured yourresources correctly and we'recontinuously monitoring for them butthere's no point if you can't prove allthis good work that you've been doing sowithin security Command Center we havecompliance reporting this is a greatcapability for you to be able to detectand see how you've been performingagainst many of these popular benchmarkslike PCI ISO CIS nist and whatnot andwe're continuously improving ourcoverage and making this a go-to placefor you to monitor how you're performingagainst themand coming soon is CIS 2.0 Benchmarkwhich I'm really excited to share withyou allright so we've talked a little bit aboutmany of these out of the box detectionsbut we've heard from customers like youmany times that these detections aregreat but my environment I need a littlebit more customization so you know youmay want to have your KMS keys forexample rotated every 30 days and wehave a great out of the box detector todetect any key that's not been rotatedwithin the 90 days we also hear so howdo you do that you can do that throughcustomizations and I'll touch on that ina minuteum another thing that we hear is youwant more coverage across your resourcesso now with custom security healthanalytics detection modules you willactually be able to detectmisconfigurations across your assets inyour inventory you can configure theserules and detect these configurationsthe misconfigurationsanother great capability for you to beable to sort of detect and preventmisconfigurations is custom org policiessecurity Command Center is deeplyintegrated with custom org policies andif you know anything about org policiesit's a great way for you to sort of sayhey here are the kinds of configurationsthat are allowed across my resources andwhen they drift away from that securityCommand Center detects them in real timeso great way for you to start secure andstay secureall right I'm going to jump into a demoto talk through some of these and showyou some of these capabilitiesso here we are the security CommandCenter you can find that within thesecurity menu item so here we areyou know we'll talk through all of thesesections but I want to jump into onespecific finding here within thevulnerabilities section here I'm seeinga finding this is the compute secureboot disabled and having secure bootenabled as you know protects you againstfood kits and boot kits and this isreally importantI see that here under the resourcedisplay name instance one is actuallythe one that's misconfigured and doesn'thave this enabled so I'm going to go tothis assets view that I talked about tolearn a little bit more about instanceone and see what I can what informationI can get there so navigating to theassets Viewhere I'm able to learn a little bit moreabout the instance I can see the projectit belongs to the resource type where itwas created what the state is when itwas created including other metadatalike the tags and the labels and thenetwork information here clicking intothe details view I get additionalinformation about this particularcompute instance that doesn't havesecure boot enabled and looking at ithere it looks like there are sixsecurity findings we'll touch on that ina second that worries me but I also getto see some of the other informationlike the IPS and whatnotso looking into the findings reallyamazing we've Consolidated a lot of thesecurity findings related to this aparticular compute instance here you cansee the change history and the fullmetadata so let's verify that computeboot is indeed disabled hereall right I have the confirmation thatit's false now I only saw one findingbut there could be a case where maybeother instances got exceptions fromresource orders and security admins soI'd like to actually go to the assetquery to just ensure that which are theother compute instances that don't havea secure boot enabledasset query as you can see here we havea number of templated queries for youthese are queries customers are writingin day in and day out and all you got todo is apply this query things around heyshow me where these VMS have beencreated in a specific location show mewho has access to a specific resourcequery here to figure out the othercompute instances that don't have secureboot enabledright off the bat the asset query givesme this result oh my I'm seeing a longlist of compute instances herethis is something it looks like I haveclose to about 50 of them here what Ican do here is actually go ahead andExport them work with my developments tosee which one warranted actually anexception and fix some of themisconfigurations here so it's a greatway for you to use the asset view aswell as the asset querynow let's dive into that security uh insecurity Command Center let's dive intoCustom Security Health analytics hereso as I talked about we have this greatout of the box detector and you can seethat it's mapped to many complianceBenchmark standards here the requirementis that we're going to detect anyencryption key that's not been rotatedwithin the 90-day period but what if youwant to do it within the 30-day periodyou want to ensure all of your teams arerotating keys under the 30-day periodyou can do so within security healthanalytics head over to manage settingsunder security health Analyticsgo over the modules and let's create amodule to detect exactly thisso here I'm going to populate it we'regoing to call this KMS key rotatedwithin 30 daysthe specific resource that I'm going toselect here is the crypto keygreat and using common expressionlanguage you can really Define simpledetection logic so here we're going tosay we want the key rotated within the30-day period which translates to about720 hoursand let's go ahead and hit next toDefine additional details you can alsospecify the severity for your custommodules here and Define exactly what itis that this detection is doing andprovide comprehensive next steps on howto actually fix this misconfigurationshould your team encounter this findingso let's go ahead and create this moduleall right so it looks like it wassuccessfully createdand as you can see here this is themodule and it is enabled so I'vegenerated some findings for us take alook at this the KMS key rotated it's amedium severity and let's dig into itsome duet AI magic here and the AIgenerated summary and it's telling youhey if someone gets access to this keythat has not been rotated they couldactually encrypt they could actuallyhave access to your data this is reallyproblematic you get some really goodinformation here from the AI generatedsummary including some security contactsthat your team can go ahead and reachout to you can look at the descriptionthat we specified as well as the nextsteps for them to be able to go aheadand fix this so it's a great way for youto you know configure a misconfigurationdetectors across your assets in yourasset inventorynow that we've talked a little bit aboutthe custom detections the out of the boxdetections you want to be able to proveall of the good work you've been doingso heading over to the compliance menuhere within the security Command Centeras you can see here we have reports by anumber based on a number of complianceBenchmark standards CIS PCI nist ISO youcan look to see how your environment isperforming against many of these let'sclick into one of them the PCI DSS hereand within each of these reports we'reproviding you details on the modules andthe detectors that actually are backedby these that back up these benchmarksyou're able to see the exact categoryyou're able to find out therecommendations on how to fix them aswell as the active findings and thestandards that all of these modules mapto really great way for you to see howyou're doing and Export them to workwith your teams share them with yourAuditors and your Executives based onall the work you've been doinggreatso we talked a little bit about thefirst set of Technologies which isaround misconfigurations the next set ofthing I want to talk about the secondone is around software vulnerabilitiesmanaging risk is about managing yourmisconfiguration and yourvulnerabilities so I'm excited to shareweb security scanner this is the sameexact technology that Google uses toprotect its web applications if you'vebuilt applications on top of Googlecompute engine or kubernetes engine orapp engine we actually detect for a lotof those software vulnerabilities thingslike SQL injection weak passwordscross-site scripting right a publiclyaccessible git repositories these arethe kinds of vulnerabilities that we areregularly detecting even for Google andother customers as well many of thesedetections are mapped to the owasp top10 specifications so really great wayfor you to protect your web applicationsagainst some of the softwarevulnerabilitiesI'm also very very excited to share thatwe recently brought launched theintegrated vulnerability scanner this isan agentless vulnerability scanner thatis powered by tenableand it produces close to about 80 000 itcan detect over 80 000 um findings andsoftware vulnerabilities related to yourOS Network and application related cvesand it does so in two ways it does it byone doing an authenticated softwarescanning targeting the vm's operatingsystem as well as as well as thesoftware applications that are runningon it and it provides additionalinformation like the network Portbindings things like the assessment youknow what security patches were appliedto the operating system and when itcannot authenticate it actually does ananonymous Network scanning of the vm'snetwork interfaces and we'll dive into ademo of these capabilitiesso starting with a web security scanneryou can actually filter for just thosefindings for your application under thesource display name web security scannerhere and as you can see there are anumber of software vulnerabilities thatthe scanner has detected here a ton ofcross-site scripting some outdatedlibraries let's jump into one of thehigh ones this cross-site skirting hereagain AI generated summary powered byduet AI doing some magic here to get ussome good summarization based on thecontent here here it's telling meactually we found a bug that's throughthe JavaScript callback it's a highseverity it was recently created and Iget additional information about theapplication and where the the resourceslive here I also get to see additionalinformation on the ovas standards thatthis is related to let's take a look atanother one this is another bug that wasdetected through the vulnerability theangularjs moduleand you can see additional informationherearound the specifications of the owaspstandard that it's violatinggreat so this is some of the ways youcan use web security scanner now talkingabout the vulnerability scanner poweredby tenable you can look for that underthe software vulnerability modulelooking at it here we find that there'sone critical finding so let's dive deepinto itso here the SSH server server isconfigured to support Cipher chainblocking uh Cipher block chaining andthis is a big problem for us so let'stake a look I also get to see that cveID that I talked about and if you seehere you can actually find othersecurity findings as well that have thecve ID so you can you know you can sortof focus on them holisticallygreat and you can look at the next stepshere to work with your teams toremediate the software vulnerabilityso we've talked about misconfigurationfigurations software vulnerabilities andthe next thing I want to talk about isidentitiesone of the things when it comes toprotecting your Cloud we know that itreally starts with having a strongidentity Protection Program and strongentitlements that are bound by leastprivilegewe think of this right Gartner has foundthat more than 95 percent of theaccounts actually use less than threepercent of the entitlements that theyare granted think about this for asecond this is a huge attack surface andthis is because of a lot ofmisconfigurations and the policies thatwe give identities and it's reallyreally hard to get this right in thecloud you actually don't know how wellyou've configured it it's you knowyou're not sure what is the effectiveaccess all of these things areproblematic and make it very vulnerablefor the identities of the access thatthey haveso with regards to misconfigurations andidentity related access drives we have anumber of detections out of the boxdetections it's within Cloud securityCommand Center things related to toxiccombinations when there's no separationof Duties right that's a great we have anumber of detections on that we alsohave a number of detections forpermissive grants you've given some ofthese um you know service accounts a lotof admin privileges we also newly have Iam recommender integrated into securityCommand Center and I'll demo that injust a secondand we finally also are able to detectpublic access to your resources so ifsomeone in your environment has or hasan open group that gives access to gcpresources we detect that in real timeand we're able to tell you this isreally hard to do because as you knowgroups have tons of nested groups inthere but we're able to detect anypublic access within those groups inreal timewe're also doing a lot with anomalousbehaviors through our threat detectionprogram herewith threats we have a number of threatsthat we detect related to users andservice accounts and because we're thecloud provider we're deeply integratedwith a lot of these services to be ableto detect anomalous behavior when adormant service account becomescertainly active these are things thatwe're able to detect and alert you rightawayand this is really one of the ways wedifferentiate against ourum with our threat Protection Programokay so let's dive into this demo hereyou can see within security CommandCenter we have a number of detectionsthat I just showed you the admin serviceaccount over privileged accounts toomany KMS users when you should only behaving three that have access to thatkey open group Iams that makes it easyfor anyone from outside yourorganization to have accessbut let's focus on the I am recommenderone this is the overprivileged serviceaccount user I see that there's quite afew of them but I'm going to focus onthe ETD e2e project here it worries mebecause that's a production projectlooking at it here I'm able to see thatthere's a recommendation for a serviceaccount it looks like this serviceaccount can do 11 impersonations ofother service accounts that worries methis is a last a really large blastradius hereand I see that there's a recommendationto remove some excess permissions hereso clicking into it I love it therecommender is telling me that I'm ableto replace the editor role that hasabout 7 000 permissions with this otherrole that has about 50. it also tellsyou exactly the permissions that wereused and all of the excess permissionsthat are safe to remove and with the newrole it'll show me exactly that we'rekeeping the permissions that are usedand the things that you see in red herethese are all the things that are safeto remove as well with this new role nowsomething catches my eye here if youlook at this blue Highlight here this isthe ml generated inferred permissionswhat it does here for you is that eventhough the user hasn't used thispermission we know that they'll need itat some point and makes it really safefor you to hit apply and remove all ofthose excess permissions we havecustomers automating this at scaleremoving thousands and thousands ofpermissions excess permissions on adaily basis so I highly encourage you totry this outall right and with that I'll hand itover back to Sarahthanks Vandyattack exposure as I mentioned earlieris a really essential tool tounderstanding your most pressingsecurity issues and prioritizingremediationattack exposure is powered by attackpass simulations which are used insecurity Command Center to evaluatesecurity posture findings and quantifyrisk now we just launched this newcapability over the summer and alreadywe're seeing that it's delivering strongbenefits for customerslet's talk for just a moment about thisthe the need why do we need thisunderstanding of the attack exposure forvarious findingsfor a variety of reasons I mentionedsome of these earlier it's not uncommonfor customers to have a large number ofposture and vulnerability issues in thisDynamic ever-changing Cloud environmentand so they really need to understandwhich of these are most essential forthem to address firstsecond a high severity finding a highlycritical issue may be discovered on anasset that's really embedded deep withina workload and so it may be that anattacker really can't access thatparticular resource or it's very hardfor an attacker to access that resourceso even though the finding is a highseverity the risk is not high the riskin fact can be quite lowthird often the greatest risk is posedby the combination of findings acrossmultiple resources and so you need theability to connect the dots betweenthosefinally not all resources pose the samelevel of risk to an organization adatabase containing sensitive financialdata for example is going to be a higherTarget of an attack and the impact ofthe breach of that data is going to havemore significant impacts and more bemore costly for the organizationthe security Command Center can identifythe findings and the combinations offindings that pose the most risk to anorganization's highest value assetsthat by generating an exposure scoreso let's talk a little bit about how howit works so the first step here is inthe model creation so we generate a biggraph model of your Google Cloudenvironments understanding the resourcesthe connections between these resourcesidentity and access policies and andmore so we build out this large model ofyour environmentsimulations are conducted on that modelwhere a virtual attacker attempts kindof everything and anything lots ofpermutations to to try to gain accessum to these valued resourcesnow because the simulations are actuallyrun on the model there's no impact onyour live environment and thesimulations include both what is 100known about the environment but alsoknown unknowns things like a credentialcompromise and phishingnow you don't need to create complexqueries to to yourself kind of discoverthe the risk that's posed it's all fullyautomated and because it's built intoyour environment there's no agents todeploy no snapshots that are sent toexternal systems for analysisnow the resulting insights of this areyou know answers to really vitalquestions things like how exposed areyour valued resources what are the pathsthat pose the greatest risk and whichfindings should you prioritizeremediation ofso the resulting attack exposure scoreis that kind of primary mechanism thatyou'll use to prioritize findings soyou'll see that an attack exposure scoreis present on the most commonmisconfigurations and vulnerabilitiesand you can sort this list based on thatscore and start at those issues thathave the the highest scorenow that score is is derived using analgorithm and a variety of differentfactors are are taken into account therethis includes things like the number andthe value of the resources that areexposedum uh that are exposed and now you havesome control you have controlum over uh the resource value definitionfor those assets in your environment soyou can Define resource value highmedium or low based on a variety ofdifferent parameters perhaps theresources in a particular project orfolder present a higher level of risk tothe organization therefore a highervalue Asset value it could be resourcetype particular types of resources youyou consider to be higher value or evenyour own custom labels and tags can beusedso the possible pass an attacker couldtake on a given resource the probabilitythat an attacker in these varioussimulations will successfully reach thedestination of that high value resourcethe impact of a particular findingum and how it specifically contributesto the overall exposure all of these aretaken into account and calculating thisattack exposure scoreand finally the most likely path ispresented to you uh in an easy toum easy to use graphical experience soyou can actually walk the steps that anattacker would take in this particularpath to gain access to your valuedresource clicking on various nodes togain additional information about theresource and the findings that arerelated to that resourcethis is an incredibly powerful visualtool and we've heard from customers somesome stories recently about how they'veleveraged this to encourage resourceowners to resolve open securitymisconfigurations and vulnerabilitiesyou have the ability to actually stepthrough and see step by step what anattacker can do to gain access to yourresources it's it's pretty compellinghard to ignore and can be a bigmotivator for for folks to fix theissues that exist thereokay so let's do a demo here of theattack path stimulation so I see here asSarah pointed out you know you can usethe score to actually prioritize thefinding that you're going to focus onI'm going to focus on the open SSH oneit's one of the higher scored ones itshows me that the score is 24 and oh boyit's you know associated with four highvalue resources here which once againyou can specify and configure using tagslabels and just selecting the exactresource that you valueso let's collapse this and let's diginto this graph a little bit herezooming inlet's take a look so this attackercoming in from the internet right I seethat there are four things that they cando to get access to instance one numberone it looks like clicking into thiswith the SSH key let's expand it so theycan steal the credentials of this SSHkey right and then sort of takeadvantage of the vulnerabilities in thefirewalls here so that red thing thatyou see it tells you exactly what thevulnerabilities are so that one is anopen firewall misconfiguration this onelooks like it has an open HTTP Port thisis an open SSH Port this is an attackerI can take this use those firewall gapsand get access to instance one which isa high value resource and oh boy itlooks like that one has a public IPaddress as well and it has a serviceaccount that has an overprivilegedservice account user role so I can takeall of those and permissions and thenaccess the compute instance OS loginall right so from there let's see whathappens I'm able to make my way intoinstance two now another high valueresource and let's take a look at theservice account attached to it it hasadmin privileges and a service accountuh user privilege as well that's overpermissive again using these firewallsit can get access to the computeinstance OS admin login and it makes itsway the attacker can make their way toinstance four which is again a highvalue Asset in your environment so thisis a great way for you to sort ofTraverse the entire graph to understandthe attack path an adversary can takewe are near the end now our fifthindispensable technology is actually aset of both capabilities andintelligence that combine to help youdetect threatsso detecting threats targeting yourCloud environments is different thereare new planes of attack and newopportunities for instrumentationin recognition of these unique threatsfacing Cloud environments minor releasedan update to their attack framework forEnterprise that's really tailored atthose unique tactics that are seen andattacks that Target Cloud resourcesat Google unlike many Standalonesecurity vendors has really deepexpertise in defending Cloudenvironments and detecting Cloud threatsand it layers out with unmanaged orunmatched threat intelligencenow align to the miter attack Cloudattack framework security Command Centeroffers detections that span the miterkill chain and address the most commontacticsnow this includes detecting initialaccess through Brute Force attacksmalware and crypto mining exploitationpersistence through anomalous IM grantsand privilege escalation evasiontechniques to anonymize accesscredential access and finallyexfiltration of cloud services such asbigquery and Cloud SQLthreat detection in the cloud reallyrequires this focus on both the platformand the workload now at the platformlevel this includes analyzing events innear real time to understand whatchanges are being made to yourenvironments who is making those changeswhat are the implications of thosechanges and this requires collection andAnalysis of identity API managedservices and network datanow at the network layer this includesanalyzing the software running oncompute and kubernetes instancessometimes getting deep into the kernellayersecurity Command Center offers detectionmodules at each of these differentlayers with special emphasis ondetecting identity compromise identityrelated threads Bandy shared a lot morewith us earlier about the Investmentsthat we're making there and thecapabilities that we have as well asprotecting compute and kubernetesworkloads at runtimenow Google we have unique access toTelemetry from Google cloud services andCloud logging and we can gain deepinsights into compute and containerswithout requiring customers to installand manage agentswe can analyze this massive volume ofdata again in near real time layering onMandan threat intelligence and a varietyof advanced analytics capabilitiesthings like ueba to help detect threatsand we're now enabling teams to extendour out of the box and manage detectionswith their own private in threatintelligence then create their ownreal-time detections using their ownknown bad IP addresses or maliciousdomains or to identify activity relatedto break glass admin accountsand finally we're continuouslyinnovating and delivering new detectionsto customers as we create new detectionlogic as new threats emerge some recentadditions include extending ouragentless kernel Integrity detectionsexpanding our crypto mining detectionsfor GCE and gke and many of the identityrelated detections that Vandy spokeabout earlier and much more again thisis a continuous process where we builduh release tune and refine detections onan ongoing basisAndy okay so let's talk about a coupleof the threads here I'm going to startwith a malicious script executed whatyou're seeing here is an mlclassification of a bash script that wasexecuted in a container now when itcomes to protecting kubernetes you haveto do it in a kubernetes native way andwhen it comes to defending you actuallyhave to understand what your attackersare doing so when we started investingin kubernetes threat detection one ofthe first things that we did is wedeployed hundreds of pieces ofvulnerable software against the internetand we monitored what is what areadversaries doing with that softwarevulnerable software in a kubernetesenvironment now what we learned is in 90of those cases somewhere in their killchain they actually executed A bashscript so what we did here at Google iswe took some of those bash scripts rightand we use national natural languageprocessing to actually teach our mlmodels to understand bash now once wedid that the next thing was to train itto understand and differentiate betweengood and bad and we did the Good by justgetting some benign scripts from theGitHub stories and the malicious ones weactually got from a source that werecontractually prohibited from mentioningokay so now we've trained our models wefine-tuned it and we put it intoproduction and as you can see here weshow you the exact bash script that willshow you that hey this was the bashscript that was going ahead and gettingexecuted and this is something you canactually further dive deep into and sortof look into to see what it is that'sgoing on here and there you go this isthe exact script it's a really cool waythat we actually use ml to sort ofdetect your threads in your kubernetesenvironmentnow let's go into another one that'salso very interesting and this is acrypto mining detection now 86 percentof the compromises involve some amountof crypto mining right and when youthink about an attacker getting intoyour compute environment one of the topuse cases is actually crypto mining sowe being agentless here and doing thisdetection we've deeply integrated intoGoogle services so this makes it reallyhard for the attacker to actuallyobserve or evade any of this so lookingat this here we're not just you knowunderstanding the contents of yourmemory and great AI summary here tellingyou exactly what we've detected here foryoubut we've not just gone ahead andscanned the contents of your memoryusing the Yara rules that you see herebut we actually understood the kernelsymbols and we processed that head andwe work backwards and we saw this wesaid hey here's the exact process namehere are the arguments with which itstarted and take a look here's the exactprogram binary that we think your teamshould look into because this is themalicious code that's actually runningso as Andy mentioned crypto miningattacks are really pervasive in thecloud this is not a gcp Centric issuefor sure this is this is you know widelyseen across all of the cloud platformswe are so confident though about ourability to detect these attacks quicklythat we recently launched a new cryptomining Protection Programso how this works customer simply deploya security Command Center premium fortheir entire organization they verifythat it's configured according to bestpractices and that they have theappropriate security controls in placeand then if Google Cloud fails to detecta crypto miningit the customer can Quest up to onemillion dollars in credits for anyexcess compute charges that were relatedto the attackokay so this concludes our list of thethe five indispensable Technologiesrelated to posture vulnerabilitymanagement attacks and threats but waitthere is one more I have a bonus bonusuh technology for you that I want tocoverum briefly you know in order to realizethe full value of security CommandCenter you must operationalize use ofboth the posture and threat findings andfor many customers this involvesintegrating these findings into othersystemssecurity Command Center offers seamlessintegration with our own Chronicle stemsolution and with this integration youcan easily pivot from finding detailsinside of security Command Center intocurated alert view inside of Chronicleand from there you can leverageadditional data toand workflows to investigate andremediate a threat detected by securityCommand Centerin addition security Command Center andincludes many out of the boxIntegrations with leading itsm Sim andsoar vendors one of the most notable ofthose is our integration with servicenow which includes support for multipleorgs findings dashboards workflows andand much morewe also offer a pub sub model whichenables you to integrate findings withvirtually any third-party system and youcan also export to bigquery we have alot of customers that do that to buildout their own dashboards and and customreportingokay so that concludes our five plus onesix uh top Technologies if you'reinterested in learning more we're takingthe show on the road so to speak soencourage you to join one of the halfday Cloud security workshops that arecoming to a city near you Cloud SecurityExperts are going to be there doingproduct demonstrations technical deepDives and
