buildingum not really sure about the efficacy ofthat security controls but just wantedto make sure you all know that Googleactually does more than physicalsecurity we also do digital security andthat's what this talk is about okay soso we have an action-packed show todaywe'll be doing live demos of variousproducts a bunch of speakers includingone special customer partner who's beena pioneer of cyber security globallyso Google Cloud one of the things thatwe've always been proud of was toactually keep raising the bar especiallywhen you're like number threeobviously you have to get close todifferentiating ourselves over a periodof time and hopefully at conferencetoday you've actually seen that you knowwe had a power to reckon with globallybutbut we wanted to sort of make sure thatwe're keeping to raise the barcontinuously over a period of time andevery pillar of our Google Cloudstrategy including securityand being humble and hungry to sort oflook beyond the classical sharedresponsibility model that cloud isalways known for into a world of shadefate where we put real skin in the gameand the way we manifested that at leastin security was using three primarystrategies obviously Frontline Intel andexpertise where we are there for youbefore during and after an incidentwe've got obviously the you know atrusted Cloud platform which goes beyondsecure by Design and default togenuinely take a risk first approach tocloud computing and then last but notleast and this is something that we'vesort of I would say had to push thesystem internally inside Google is toactually think Beyond just providingSecurity on top of gcp but to bottle upthat IPthat protects alphabet protects you toprotects ads protects Chromeand make it available to customerswherever they are in the form of modernsecurity operations whether it beChronicle whether it be mandian productswhether it be recapture fraud managementand so forth so that you can actuallyconsume these Google serviceson any other cloud or your ownon-premises environmentand of course since we haven't talkedabout AI at this conference we thoughtwe'll add some slides on AIfor security but this is where we'llactually spend a lot of time showing andshowing what we're actually announcingreleasing mainstream around securityproducts today okayso before I get into many of the productdetails and some of the capabilitiesthat we'reyou know sort of you know running andgunning with over the last few yearsand excited to launch this week andBeyondwe want to start with look just takingstock of the latest threat landscapeandwho better do this than probably theperson who wrote the bookon cyber securitymy good friend Kevin mandia pleasewelcome Kevin on stagethank you thank you got itI think it's still morning but Sunil hadhis hair done for the last three hoursso I lost track of time I appreciate allof you making the time to be here I'vegot about six minutes and sometimes I'mreferred to as the fear uncertainty indoubt guy so I'm going to try to notinstill fear uncertainty in doubt andjust get right to some statisticslast year Mandy it was on the frontlines responding to approximately 1200security breaches and these are thebreaches that are at a scale and scopewhere customers need help they need usto go in and augment the staff to figureout really what happened the forensicsand then what to do about it in additionto doing approximately 1200investigations we have 400 threatanalysts and mandians intelligence groupit's a Global Group they speak over 30languages in 26 different countries andwe try to be in all the hot zones wewant to be in South Korea to see whatNorth Korea is doing on offense we wantto be in Israel you can hear from themlater today to see what Iran's doing onoffense in the United States you see thebest cyber Espionage capabilities out ofChina and out of Russia we want to be inKiev and we've been in in the Ukrainesince 2011 so we could see a lot of whathappens in the battlefield ahead of timeand we can prepare for the next modernconflict should there ever be one so wehave the threat analysts from mandian wehave the incident response we have thethreat analyst group from Google we haveTeam Zero from Google and we take allthis and come together what did we learnin the last 12 months uh very quickly Ilooked at 2022 it was the first year inmy career and we've been tracking thesestatistics since1998. one of the things we learned wasthat from about 2003 to 2019 the wavefolks were breaking in was spear fishingprior to that it was actuallyexploitation of servers then it went tospearfishing and what I call client-sideattacks hacked the client and break inthat way and then it's back tovulnerabilities again exploitation ofvulnerabilities took the front row in2020 and it's still there today sothat's the threat change there second isthe first year in my career that thebest cyber offense came out of China themost Innovation and offensiveexploitationto hit Edge devices came out of Chinathird zero days are on the rise Big Timemeaning attacks that are going to workagainst an application there is noavailable patch we usually saw between 8to 15 zero days a year between 1998 and2019 and suddenly we saw 32in 1930 zero days used in the wild in202081-0 days used in the wild in 2021 and55 last year and then this year we'reactually ahead of that schedule so we'regoing to see there's a lot more zerodays what that means is all of us needto be more prepared for what I call theApex attacker the person that isdeploying zero days they're not slammingit against everybody on the planetthey're very precise going after defenseindustrial base or going after specifictargets and we're going to use our toolsand our capabilities at Google to makesure that all of you can be betterprepared for these Apex attackers aswell so neat thing before I move on tothe next slide and how AI is going tohelp game shift or shift change everyway we're doing security is thatsecurity software is about the onlysoftware I'm aware of that has anadversary to it somebody that's activelyworking every every day to besurreptitious evade detection and evadethe efficacy of what we're buildingwhich means you have to have a learningcycle you have to have software thatthinks and learns whether from peopleand refined from the front lineexperiences we have or from Ai andlearning what's normal on your networkinstantiating normal and theninstantiating what's abnormal and soyou'll hear more from Sunil today on ourproduct roadmaps and how we're going touse AI to help make all of our networksyou can keep the confidentialityintegrity and availability of your datathe way you want the other thing I wantto talk about is Toil and I live thisfirsthand my first job ever was at thePentagon as an Air Force officer whereI'd go into a skiff and I'd sit thereand hit page down pretty much for thefirst three hours looking at log filesand I'm not making that up that wasreally my job I'd have my plate of eggsright here I'd eat a little bit and thenpage down page down page down lookingfor who was accessing what was there anyanomalies that was state of the art 1993I've lived through 30 years ofimprovements but all security analyststoday are being inundated with alertsmade by engineers and softwaredevelopers that don't think SecurityFirst they think the function of theirsoftware first and they create log filesthat are arbitrary to whatever theengineer wants to have in those logfiles generating alerts and generatingmessages that sometimes require us todecipher those lots of noise lots ofexperience required to figure out whatyou need to defend so you're going tohear Sunil talk about how we're creatingtools on top of Chronicle that comeembedded in the software to just reducethe toil of all your Frontline Securityoperators and then something that's veryimportant is you know it's there's a lotof esoteric knowledge in cyber securityand we want to be able to advance peoplefaster at it so Google went public withhaving a cyber security certificate andworking with Coursera to make sure foescan sign up and get educated because wehave a shortage of expertise but I alsolook at the software we're making andSunil unfolds the roadmap you're goingto see a demo by Steph hey today whereyou can see that we can train peopleusing the AI capabilities as well sowhen folks are inside of our softwarelooking at and triaging alerts it'salmost like having what we called in theAir Force a heads-up display where youget to see here's what we know aboutthat IP address here's what we knowabout that file here's what we knowabout that Yara rule here's what we knowabout the threat group that's behind itand when those things sort of pop up andaugment your staff it's going to slowlybut surely train your staff to getbetter at cyber security and that'ssomething that we've needed for a longtime so that I appreciate you being hereand I'll welcome Sunil back on stage togo through our new advancements Sunilthank you siryou know umyou know if you've met Kevinobviously he's a fount ofknowledge but also interesting storieshe does still eat some eggs while he'sstill doing some meetingsdoesn't do page Downs anymore butum but in this stage I was just thinkingabout it when he was talking about hisbackground we probably have two of theworld's most seasoned sort of combos offolks who understand how the threatactor works and how to defend andhopefully you'll you'll meet the secondyou know the second person shortly andyou know obviously we'll be around andif you folks want to hang out after thiswould be greatto exchange some knowledge so what Kevintalked about obviously was you knowessentially we've doubled down onsynergizing mandiant within Google Cloudwe've taken Wireless totalMandy and thread IntelGoogle tag save browsing from chromeand a few more Intel sources fromProject zero and Beyond and fuse theminto one threat Intel platform thatyou'll hear more about shortly includingin some of the deeper sessions and thatthat Intel capabilities are obviouslyempowering our front lineboth mandian folks as well as ourstrategic Partners so we'll talk aboutbut alsoenriching and enhancing the context ofsecurity operations both on gcp as wellas Chronicle now before we get into someof the broader capabilities aroundsecurity operations just to give youfolks an idea of what we've done so farin terms of raising the bar on GoogleCloud security itselfyou knowpeople talk about the roadmap I knowKevin shout the slide at the keynote itwas probably the only one that actuallygot some Applause but but basically thisis a thing that we normally don't talkaboutuh but it's true is that when you lookat vulnerabilities we are dramaticallylower than the other clouds in realityespecially the blue cloud that rhymeswith failure okay so uh so hopefully youknow there's some reality behind this atleast from a cyber security perspectiveand the way that we've really sort ofinternalized this in the road map andlook this is we're still far from beingdoneis around this risk's first approach andstarting from things simple things suchas actually doing deep integratedvulnerability management and securesecurity Command Center for all yourcompute engine workloads to actuallyintegrating in real-time threatdetection not just log skills to thededuction real-time threat detectionso that you can put some real skill inthe game this is a good example of shadefade where we announced this cryptomining uh you know guarantee wherewe are so confident in detecting BitcoinBitcoin mining within our own computeworkloads because it exists for all ofour alphabet properties too we've hadgreat success at packaging this now toprotect our customers wherever they areon gcpof course you can't obviously cover thescope of the uh the cloud platformwithout actually talking about thenetwork and this is where with some deepPartnerships with Palo Alto networks toactually raise the bar Beyond justdetection to actually prevention withNext Generation firewalls but alsoproviding an open ecosystem so thatcustomers and partners can bring theirbest Best in Class Network Services toplug into our quote-unquote Networkvalue chain okayand of course from the network there'sthe data elementin data you've always heard us be in theForefront of confidential computingit's still an early stage in the marketas you all knowlots of Promise some very focused usecases such as for example with verylarge customers using ads or cookieprotection and so forth you need a levelof confidential Computing platform highfrequency trading algorithms beingprotected and so forth but with theAdvent of TDX now mainstream and goingga next year we expect this to becomemore mainstream just like shielded VMSwas I think they said like 80 attachedto compute VMS right now right and andof course it's just not on the Computingside it's also on the data side wherea year ago one of the thingswe did and you know I don't know howobvious this is to all of you was DLPand clouds was always something that youwould set up as a separate control rightwe took the approach to actually burn inDLP inside the core workflow when youactually set up bigquery so that whenyou actually spin up a bigquery instanceset up tables and so forth you have theoption to actually quote unquote halvesdata protected by default just likeencryption by default and we're nowenhancing that same capability acrossour data portfolio into Data Lake intothe database portfolio and so forth andyou'll see more of thisyou know invisible security constructthat we've always talked about wheremany of these controls are actuallyburnt into your core workflows withoutbeing a control on topand then last but not leastduring covetwe used to have the 7am Monday callsbetween Thomas and a whole bunch offolks where when sovereignty was such abig thing in 2020 2021 and it was one ofthose moments where we recognized thatwhatever we do about global sovereigntywill help U.S companies global companieswhether they're based in the US or orour governments worldwide and we wereclearly ahead of any other cloudprovider in actually creating a varietyof sovereignty constructs fromdata sovereignty to operationalsovereignty to actually true softwaresovereignty in a more comprehensivesovereignty approach and we manifestedit in the form of assured workloads forthe public government for Enterprisesglobal companiesand we have started expanding thisacross all of our regions and the latestthing is that now we are now in Japanwith the version of assured workloads aswell okayso just to net it out loud clearly youknow the the thing that you shouldexpect more from us is to act thinkabout getting more of the mandiansignals the expertise plugged into thisrisk first approach that's waycomprehensive Beyond just posturemanagement a threat management acrossthe full stack of gcpand but doing it in a way so that it'sactuallyyou know integrated into the overallpolicy structure rather than being anoverlayand soso when you now look at okay so that wasthe capabilities around trusted gcpthe area that we've been really you knowsuccessful with aside from enhancing gcpcontrols is about bottling this GoogleIP to meet customers Where You Areand and when you think about this in thelast 18 months this is probably thefastest growing solution within GoogleCloud periodand it comes in the combination oftaking our best-in-class Chronicle I'lljust call it next Generation securityoperations solution infusing it withproactive capabilities that we got frommandians products such as validationwhere you can do real-time red teamingand integrate that signal into yourdetection response workflows but thencomplement the entire thing with theexpertisefrom the threat Intel that we get fromthe front line and this includescapabilities from our partnersas well as from our Frontline Defendersso that we can not justapproach this as just replacinglet's say another vendor who rhymes withGunk but going beyond thatto actually provide not just thesecurity operations platform but aproactive cyber defense solutionand soChronicle security operations platformwhich is the foundation for much of thishas some unique characteristics that wasyou know very similar to what madeGoogle search so uniqueso for example and this is stuff thatyou will see more and more publishedbecause we've been quite quiet aboutsome of our core differentiators is thatthe core platformmatters here from a both from anefficacy side and an efficiency sidewhere 20x faster searcheswe've got 4X more data retentioncapability out of the box okay bydefault we don't even allow customers tohave less than a Year's worth ofretention by the way right that's justgood hygiene as well as the kind ofcontent that comes out of the system hasbeen dramatically differentiated ascompared to the state of the art and sothis combination of everythingis now the underpinning of a major newsolution offering that we'll come outwith to not just power GlobalEnterprises but also Global nations inthe form of something that was we talkedabout on the Keynoteas cyber Shieldand again rather than me talk about thisyou know it's my great honor andprivilege to introduce I'd say theco-founder of cyber Shieldhe's been in in the uh Israeli cyberdefense for many years doing what Kevinwas doing on the U.S sideand again someone who's been both on thefront line protecting proactively aswell as reactively the nation-stateborders but also been a great partnerfor peer State nations in the AbrahamAccord and Beyondthe director general of the IsraeliNational cyber directorateand a great friend of Google GabbyPortnoy Gabby come on upthank you very very muchso good morning everybody it's a greathonor to be here in this excellentGoogle conferencesosince I was a childriding my own broom horse around thehouseI learned a long-lasting truththe night with the strongest shieldwill win the battleand will win the throneand it wasn't only about how shining theshield was it had to be strong tooto protect the center of heart toprotect the center of mass and the Heartfrom my brother's broomso I want to start with a thank youthank you Googlefor making a child's dream come truefor making all of us the Cyber nights ofthe modern eraand for a new strong and Shining cyberShield but this timeit's an on-cloud platformthat will be the next generation of thenational level securitySolutions and Technologies and willbuild a better sectorial and Nationalimmunityin the incdmaking Israel Defense stronger is ourmissionand they say all the time and emphasizeit's not about the incdit's a joint National and internationaleffortit's a joint effort between thegovernmentbetween the security organizationsbetween the Private Industry like Googleand of course our partners overseasanother concept we are focused on isdigital TrustI want to run with the technology andnot after the technology I want toenable the digital trust and the digitaltransformationbut I want to do it with Google in theright waya secure and reliable cyberspace inIsraelis our purposeto the journey we are doing to theGoogle Cloud we call it the ninbusprojectis cyber the Cyber nights this is ourCentral must and heart we need toprotectand if we think about itwe are all facing the same cyberchallengesthe ever-growing attack surface beingpushed by new technologies that Googleall the time bring to the tableand the growing motivation of ourattackersfacing these challenges what I'm sayingall the time we need to keep workingtogetherto plan and think together and preparefor them I think in the right waytogetherand what I'm telling all the time theincd is willing to sharewe are willing to share our strategiesdesigns Technologies beliefs bestpractices and even our dreamsand I have to admit we are doing ithappily because I really believe in usworking togetherand it's all about building Partnershipsand changing the culture of trustthe more we will talk the same cyberlanguagewe will do a better secure in theIsraeli Nation but this is our case Ithink all overand as you know the bids don't have anybordersso regarding to cyber Shield the more wewill spread the concept of cyber Shieldcooperate investigate share knowledgeand communicate on one globalplatform I think we will secure theworld a lot betteranother challenge its valuesmany core valueschallenge us when collaboration andteamwork are put on the tableconfidentialityprivacy leaders agendaculture Network thinking and evenself-valuewhen I look at these fears andconsiderationswhy not to collaborate and share Iremind myself all the timethere is no other way todayjust togetherthe trust we need to develop the culturewe need to changethis is our responsibility as cyberleaderswe need to show our people the way weneed to show them we trust each otherand trust them for trusting othersthe cybershit project is a part of ourcyber Domea concept to reduce the harm of cyberattacks at scalethe Dom for us it's a new Big Data AIoverall approach for proactive defenseand of coursethe Cyber Shield is a big part of ourDome as a solution based on the GoogleCloud unified cross-sector platformscontain AI algorithmsAutomation and a lot morethis solution I'm sure that will help usto defend our essential organizationsand of course our services as KnightsCentral Mass and sensitive organsand will provide us the ability todetect apts and do a better threatintelligence I hope with Monday and thatyou saw beforein our business in the security side inthe cyber security business we need torun fast and as I said before ifwe want to run faster and we must runfasterwe must do it again together and it'snot about buying two kilograms of Googlefor 2 million dollars it's not a productwe are building here a strategicpartnership that I can say we alreadytook us to a places we haven't beenbefore in a very short timeso I want to thank Google for thisunique partnership and althoughyou are a mega companyI think you move fast and intimate likea startupthe creativity The Thinking Out of theBoxit's amazingso Sunil you are backstage but I want tothank say thank you for your leadershipalso to Dom Eric and Rico Kinney you arefor me a Dream Teamuh of course the Israeli team Boaz orgeneral fear shy and alonesome of them are hereyou become our best Partners so thankyou very muchand finally I saythat by the power vested in USas the ones leading this project weKnight each otheras the Cyber nights of the Cyber shieldand we ride awaycarrying our cyber mission to fulfilltogetherfaster and with trust in our heart thankyou very muchthat's goodyou know you know Gabby obviously has ahuge responsibility on his shoulders buthopefully as some of you will get toknow himhe's definitelyuh very capablepersonin a very serious businessbut he himself is very human and not soseriousso if you find you know if you find himhanging around with a bunch of folksit's very accessible and a great partnerto have you know work with and we fullyexpect cyber Shield to be one of thosethat's not just available for GlobalNations as you hopefully you'll seefurther announcements across the worldbut also in percolating thisbest-in-class solution for ourEnterprises globally as well and that'sone way that we are manifesting that isin this net new service that we talkedabout yesterday where it's sort of likethe OnStar button for your Google Cloudplatform or your Security Services whichis within the context of your securityoperations or your sock and so forthyou're able to double click and call onmandate threat hunting expert on demandwho is already empowered with all thedata around your environment can do theDeep thread hunting on your behalf andprovide you the signals back from adetection remediation perspective in thecontext of your environment and youshould expect to see more of thesecapabilities in conjunctions with ourpart Partners as well to scale acrossour entire portfoliososo clearly obviously you know nopresentation at next is complete withoutAi and to really get into the heart ofAIbefore I we get into the products andthe capabilities I wanted to just take afew minutes to talk about the why andthe what of how we are approaching AI incyber securityand this is important because this issimilarly constructed across variousservices but especially soin cyberso if you if you folks remember the lasttime we had a game-changing you knowsort of secular change like gen AI wasprobably mobile more so than cloudand mobile was the last time where wehad a change that affected billions ofpeople not just Enterprisesand the first instantiation of mobilewas what okay you had this iPhone thatcame out an awesome combination of abrowser phone email and and you couldactually do you knowcool stuff with it mostly take picturesat some point in timebut most of your productivity wasthrough a browser where pretty muchevery site out there had to bereformatted to do a browserand the equivalent of that is like achat bot for Janae like everybody'sdoing a chatbot and it's useful and westill use the browser on the phone butthe real power of mobile was neverreallyyou know you know internalized until youfundamentally built a mobile appecosystem you built an app that youcould swipe Left Right use the camerause the GPS device and so forth andthat's what I call infused by the wayversus an air overlay and if you reallypeel open all of the Gen AI products andthe strategy per se and this is atvarious levels within the product photobut but at least in cyber I'll tell youthatfor sure we have to do an augmentativeconversational assistant in each of ourworkflows which Steph will show youshortly but we're also doing is to lookat each and every portion of ourworkflows for example in chronicle withsecurity operations log parsing shouldbeyou know enhancedcurated detection should be enhancedPlaybook should be enhanced every aspectof your workflow should be enhanced withGen AI in our opinion and and that'shopefully what you'll see through someof our product portfolio capabilitiesbut ultimately our goal is to ensurethat maybe at some point in time you maynot even have a chatbot so that do it isquote unquote invisible within cybersecurity operationsso the way we have looked at by the waythe the overarching you know uh you knowsort of uh challenges ahead of us youknow you heard this so I won't spend toomuch time on this and you'll get a lotmore details around how we're breakingit down across threats toil and talentbut I'll give you a simple aha Missionaround each of them that we've beenworking onin toilwhich by the way plagues many of thefolks in this audience and Beyond or inyour teamswe want to make security funand one of the ways is to just reducethe amount of churn that one has to doin some of the tools that we have outthereand so the the core aha there is look ifyou can generate codeyou should be able to generate thesecurity controls associated with it youshould be able to generate thecompliance controls associated with iteventually that's ultimately how systemswill secure themselves and so that's ourtrue north for how we are approachinginsecurity and the way we are deliveringit is in this three step or three stackmannerthe first part and the lowest layer isthe part that you'll hear a lot moreabout in the upcoming quartersis beyond obviously the governance andcompliance controls to keep vertex AIsafeetc etc which we've already been in playwe are investing heavily andsignificantlyto actually protect the AI supply chainso think about it as what we did forsalsa for a software supply chainyou should look forward to us equal andupdate for the AI supply chain driven byBest Practices but also as productcapabilitiesnow on top of that obviously you'veheard us talk about the AI workbenchthis is the probably the only productcapability within gcp that has a domainspecific llm we've talked about medpombut SEC Palm 2 is essentially you knowthe manifestation that we've gottenthrough trainingthe you know the core llm from Google ona lot of security data whereas totaldata management threat Intel and soforth and then on top of that is how wedelivered first party products as wellas third-party products right and andbefore I talk about a lot of our firstFriday productsthe AI workbench is now being adoptedrapidly by a variety of partners that wewill will showcase where the spirit isto not just leverage first party Intelbut to leverage third-party bestpractices in a collaborative virtualcycle so that ultimately the overallqualityof the Cyber related you knowapplications that are built on top areactually less hallucination more qualityand more efficacy and if frankly even inthe last three four months ofcollaborating with a handful of Partnerswe've made great strides because Googlealone cannot actuallycreate the level of quality that we needfor the Cyber side okayso so then to talk more about thesefirst party apps and to talk to sort ofshow you what exactly is being donewithin each product across the portfoliolet me welcome our wonderful staff heyback on stage Steph[Applause]hey thanks to Neil hi folks as Sunilsaid we're infusing generative Ai andmultiple security products I'll show youtodaywith the aim to mitigate threats reducetoil and Bridge the Cyber Talent Gap andspecifically I'm going to show you threeways duet AI helps customers improvetheir security posture one by generatingAI summaries to describe threatstwo by searching for patterns in yoursecurity data to determine if you'vebeen affected and three by recommendingactions to take both in response toalerts but also to proactively helpimprove security by closing down attackpathsso in this scenario let's say I'monboarding as the newest member of oursecurity team I want to see the latestthreat activity impacting my industry soI'm going to go ahead and check out manyet threat intelligence herenow here in the top left I see thatthere's some recent activity from athreat group called apt-43 so I want tolearn more about that I'm going to goahead and searchnow before I'd have to go through 11572 search results here that's one morethan yesterdaya lot of activity here and figure outwhich of these reports or objectsrelated to my mission decide which coretakeaways are relevant to my companybut now I see that duet hasautomatically generated a summary onthis threat actor from their vast Corpusof Frontline intelligencealso this model is grounded which helpsreduce llm hallucinations and means Ihave accurate summaries which isparticularly helpful for any reporting Imay need to do for my secops colleaguesor CSOso this is how I begin to learn theirtactics such as fraudulently miningcryptocurrency to fund illicitoperations which is bad stuff I want toprevent so here in short duet AI inmandiate provides me a boost in mythread understanding so I can betterprotect and inform my organization andthat's not allI could also check out two moreInnovations in threat intelligence bothavailable now in virustotalthe first duet Ai and virustotal is myvery own malware analyst that analyzesand describes suspicious scripts for meto help me determine whether they'remalicious or benign without meaningwithout me needing to reverse engineerthemso duet here understands more than 100file types and programming languagesincluding Lua Ruby and VBA which I cantake full advantage of to inspect anycode for its propertiesand this helps me to mitigate threatssooner and improve my general codehygiene which strengthens our securityposturethe second is a new form in virustotaldedicated to the global community ofAIML Security Experts to flag explainand contextualize different types ofmalicious softwarethis forum enables me to contribute whatI'm learning and leverage the wisdom offellow security practitioners to advanceour Collective understanding of thethreat landscapetogether all these capabilities help memore quickly identify and respond tothreats which brings me back to myscenariosogiven the Intel I just learned here I'mgoing to go ahead and I've decided I'mgoing to go ahead and search our eventdata in chronicle to see if we have anyevidence of crypto mining attack andGoogle Cloud last weekI'm going to go ahead and generate thatquery now normally I'd have to toconduct this search I'd have to type aspecific syntax it works with Chroniclesunique data model here and practicepatients because frankly since queriesqueries can be large and challenging tocreate remember it's my first daybut now as you see duet hasautomatically translated my naturallanguage input into the query so that Ican go ahead and run that search herewhich is now analyzing petabytes of datafor patterns at a speed I didn't getfrom the Sim my old team used and ifneeded I can edit the query in line andupdate in real timenow I see there's an alert here arelated alert from that search thatwe've gotten existingcrypto mining case here so here's theaffected entity and some of theinformation about it but I'm going to goahead and check out the alert on thisnowhere again normally to understand what'sgoing on in this particular case I'dscroll through all this super importantmetadata maybe check out the Play Booksfigure out whatwhat the finding information here is youneed some tenured in I need some tenureto understanding to really make sense ofthisbut now I can go ahead on the overviewand see that duet AI has summarized thisfor me front and center on the overviewI simplified this entirely for me so Ican see now all of the information aboutthis investigation summarized includingwhat's happened what's being affectedand even recommending next steps for meto take so in short duet has translatedmy search queries summarized informationabout the threat and prioritize an eventto focus on which is saving me fromhaving to deal with thousands of alertsand more efficient search and casesummaries have reduced my toil in goingfrom detection to response when everysecond counts this is Sunil is sayingso these capabilities are currently inpreview and there's more coming thisyearsoon I'll be able to interact with duetconversationally wherever I am inchroniclein this new chat experience duet willassist me in my investigations bysummarizing more advanced securityevents answering my questions on anyalert case event and converting myinputs into Yara L rules so I don't haveto be an expert on that language towrite new detectionsand since duet is context aware andconnected to virustotal and mandian Iget the latest guidance on threats andtechniquesthis is pretty coolplus duet will soon provide me with asimple and intuitive experience togenerate playbooks which are how Iautomate my response workflowand this guidance can be critical to meas a new member of the team to takeadvantage of the expertise already in myorganization and the chronicle platformitself but it's also great for my moretenured colleagues so they can focus onthe more complex challenges as new andnovel threats appear and require newplaybooks to respondso these are the kinds of capabilitiesthat can help reduce the toil of havingto detect and investigate and respondacross my growing attack surface all inone integrated platform assisted by duetAISo speaking of responding I gotta getback to my case here that's what I'mgoing to doback here I saw we've got a couple linkswhere I can pivot quickly to check outI'm gonna check out the potential taxpasses just a second but check out moreon this finding and security CommandCenternow typically in coming here I'd need tohave tenure knowledge again tounderstand what all the super importantmetadata means I might even want tocheck the Json here to review thedetailsbut now duet summarizes the signing forme automatically including why it's anissue and what I can do about itand seeing the criticality implicationsand next steps here to remediate ispretty crucial for me to action thisfinding swiftly and for my teambut I also want to see if we'revulnerable to attack through otherpotential paths so including related tothis affected resource here so I'm goingto go ahead and check out thatand here's the affected resource here'sthe attack exposure for that here's thatresource which again I could investigatethis map here node by node each hasvital info after all here understandwhat they mean determine what toproactively address how and why but nowI hit AI summary and duet summarizessummarizes as this attack path for meincluding what could actually beexploited and how to remediate thevulnerability in this case rotating aservice account key locking down acouple over permissioned accountsso these summaries enable me a newbie towork like my experienced teammates andeven have and even be able to takeaction to improve our security posturein this case shutting down the exploitright awayand even though I've gotten to thebottom of this particular exploit Iwonder what else I could do tostrengthen my security posturewellthis year I'll be able to use duet AI inidentity and access management I am toget access recommendations that helpprevent data exfilte exfiltration andgenerally reduce risky Behaviorso herewe see duethas detected access grants that permitlateral movement which is a tactic Badactors might use to gain access similarto what happened with log4j definitelywant to prevent thatthat's why duet will highlight overlypermissive roles I can adjust to bringus into a state of least privilege it'sthe kind of insight I need to closepotential attack pass before they can beexploitedand given all these powerful newcapabilities I may want to move more ofmy workloads to Google cloud of coursehowever translating my security policiesfrom other clouds can be a supergrueling processso later this year though I'll be ableto upload a file or script containing mysource policies compare policies side bysideand then download a terraform script toapply those policies to my Google Cloudprojectthis means complex policies will nolonger take weeks to translate even witha super specialized understanding ofontologies across clouds justappropriately secure workloadsso in short thanks to duet AI I cancontribute more value sooner as Ionboard to my team and that's a majorboost to my colleagues a setback for theBad actors too which are both things Ican feel proud ofand end scenario[Laughter]now what I hope you're taking fromtoday's demo is that duet AI is a keyaspect and how we're superchargingsecurity and we're all in here tochannel these capabilities to help withSecurity's toughest challenges stoppingor mitigate mitigating Downstreamimpacts from the growth of threatsreducing the toil of detecting andresponding across and expanding attackservice and bending the curve on theCyber Talent Gap so it teams can fortifytheir organizations more effectively andsecurity Specialists can focus on themost complex challengesfinally all of these Innovations areleveraging the SEC palm-2 model which wewill make available through security AIworkbench and is my cue to turn it backto you Sunil thank you Steph thank youvery muchso so obviously a lot lots of thingsthere and once again we have exceededexpectations because we are out of timeso I'm gonna jam through the rest of thestuff quickly uh and you know there'svarious sessions here where we'll doubleclick into each of the capabilities onthis particular stackbut one thing that I want to talk aboutwas the remember the AI workbenchplatform was launched with Accenture asa strategic partner contributing a lotof threat Intel into itbut over the last few months we've hadlots of Partners in a very intentionalway engage with us and if some of youare in the room I really want to thankyou all to enhance the quality of it asmaterially improved and this is a subsetof a broader ecosystem of partners thatis making obviously gcp a lot more saferthan what we could do on our ownnow the thing that just to summarizewhat we've talked about today right soclearly the velocity around Cloudsecurity is not slowed down if anythingit's accelerating and picking up againacross the boardmandian and Google Cloud have reallydoubled down to synergize to create aone plus one equals three environmentforbidden the people as well as ourSolutions out thereacross all of these pillars that wetalked aboutand each of these pillars plus obviouslyto add AI in each of the securitycapabilities have a lot of details in avariety of sessions later today that I'dencourage some of you to attendbut as Gabby mentioned and Kevinmentioned look you know we're stillhumble and hungry we're still open forinput if anything now that we have somesuccess behind us or some greatSolutions and platforms we're reallylooking forward to working with you allboth from a partnership perspective aswell as from a customer engagementperspective so that maybe you know nextyear at this time we'll have many of youas well participating to talk about yoursuccess stories so thanks again fortaking the time and hope you have a restof next okayforeign"
