actuallyturning 25 years old this year so we'vebeen through our share of growing painsas well so far you've heard a bunch ofexciting announcements here at next youmight be asking all right how do thesehelp me out in Legacy land and we'regoing to show you how some of the latestGoogle Cloud features you might haveheard about so far at next can help youdo that too but we're going to need somehelp so we invited some very specialpeople to help us out some of our GoogleCloud Champion innovators over the nextfew minutes four of these amazingChampion innovators are going to helpRichard and me take you on a whirlwindtour of four big areas where newfeatures from Google Cloud can help usbuild our next Legacy but first up tohelp us reimagine what building appslooks like in a generative AI world wehave Champion innovator and workspacegde Alice Keelerautomate everything and if necessary usecode so I'm interested in Duet AI butparticularly duet AI in app sheet likehow can I automate with just those toolsyeah so how about uh incident reportingso let's say for example that I'm aschool resource officer right or maybeeven the shift supervisor on a factoryfloor I might want a consistent way foranybody to report safety incidents ormaybe just near misses so let me see ifI can get that into a prompt that duet Ican use so I need to capture incidentreports each incident has Type statusdescription the date and each incidentshould be assigned to what a team memberright and then all we have to do isClick create app here we go we'veactually got an app yay what we justshipped a web and mobile app and wemostly use natural language right todescribe it so as a developer this isreally getting my wheels turning rightlike how much farther can I go before Ihave to start writing code yeah goodquestion like ideally I shouldn't evenhave to type the incident report that isa great use for another cool thing wejust shipped which is unstructured audiocapture with duet AI this is a minorsecurity incident that happenedyesterdayso we went from idea to app in somenumber of seconds we added these richuser experiences with audio capture andchat but there's one more big featureAlice that you said you wanted to addthere is and that's the ability toactually take a picture of ourworkstation here and see if the AI canfigure out if it's in or out ofcompliance so let's say that I built anamazing vertex AI Vision model to helpidentify pictures of workstations thatare out of compliance actually let's notsay that let's show it I actually havethat app available right now it's builtout in a different Google Cloud projectit's behind an apogee API and it looks alittle something like this and now ifyou pop open this card here okay it'sgoing to take a second for vertex AI toread this picture oh here we got this aman and a woman are posing for a picturein front of a screen that saysbroadcasting on it that's not too bad Ilove this because everything from thecloud function backwards can be owned byme the developer and my team but thisgives me the option to let some of thosebusiness teams put together their owndashboards and reports and so on andlets me Focus focus on where I canprovide unique value that's exactlyright so in just a few minutes what didwe do we shipped a web and mobileapplication prototype using naturallanguage prompts we built an audiocapture with duet Ai and we called outto other apis and machine learningservices on Google Cloudhow do you build a platform where teamproduct teams can develop fast the shortanswer is a combination of vertical andhorizontal ownership they had to empowereach vertical team to deliver a featurewithout this endless matrix ofdependencies and we had to buildexpansible but still shared horizontalinfrastructure that everybody could useso far we've seen how far duet Ai andapp sheet can get you when you want toadd new workflows to existing systemsbut let's be real a lot of the thingsyou might be working on still involve alot more traditional Cloud buildingblocks they're slinging containers yourtweak and release pipelines and we wantto build those platforms as efficientlyand reliably as possible please welcomeGoogle Cloud Champion innovator LucasCarlson I would say the three mainthings that I'm always trying to improvefirst how are applications respond toscaling events how do we better handlesurges in traffic sure second we want tomake sure the infrastructure is easy tomaintain for our platform engineeringteams so they can spend more time doingthings that add value rather than justkeeping the lights on and finally wealways want to make sure that we canbuild experiences that are morepersonalized for our customers there'sactually another really cool featurethat came out of preview recently yeahthat you might want to experiment withit's called CPU boostall right CPU boost allocates more CPUat startup time specifically to reduceyour cold start the initial experimentproved that people like the app we'd fixsome of the scaling but now we want topush it to more places from just oneregion to maybe multiple this is whereCloud deploy can come in it's one of myfavorite Services Cloud deploy alsorecently added the ability to deploy tomultiple Targets in the single stage sofor example imagine deploying to threedifferent regions at the same timethat's super useful but what about somefunctional improvements we got the easystuff but now let's actually kind of fixsome of the app we've noticed that it'sa retail app right so we have someabandoned carts a little more than usualand we want to poke those customers noidea I don't know let's see if theweather Ai and Cloud workstations canhelp us write some code either thecomment just from that we can generateall the code we need to talk to postgresdatabase to Loop through the rows andthen to email each customer that has anabandoned card so let's take a step backwhat we just did here in just a fewminutes we made our application moreperformant with CPU boostand instance configuration we useparallel deploys to actually serve thisin more regions different users and thenwe're really running fully managed Cloudrun jobs without writing a whole ton ofcode that we have to maintainturns out there was a zero dayvulnerability in a little open sourceJava Library called log4jlet me without further Ado introduce youto our next Champion innovator MarkJohnson Mark coming up hereso you know we got to talk aboutsecurity got to talk about security so Ilike to think about s3c in three piecesnumber one how are we securing ourdeveloper environments number two howare we ensuring the Integrity of thebuild process itself and then finallyhow do we protect that app once it'srunning in production so let's beginwhere all good things begin in Cloudworkstations so let me just kick off thebuild of this app here and it's runningand while that's running let's take alook at a previous run actually thatsucceeded so I've got Cloud build uphere and you can see I've got a couplesuccessful runs and when we take a lookat this notice we've got a bunch ofsteps let me pull this out so you cansee it a little bit better that areleading us down to something calledbinary authorization so if I jump overto Binary authorization here in theconsole you'll see that not only do Ihave the policy itself but next to it Ihave something called a testers you saywhat are a testers let me scroll out soyou can see those a little better atesters I like to think of those kind oflike cryptographic Pokemon all right andI'm going to collect those along the wayin order to earn that binary off checkmark at the end of my build process andfor those of you out there trying to besystematic about how you put together asoftware supply chain security flow likethis I do recommend you check out thesalsa levels at salsa.dev they can helpyou identify how mature your securitychecks are and what you may be missing Iknow it's a lot of metadata on each stepbut you do have your salsa build levelfor you here and it's also important tocall out here that all these insightsare also available in new gke Enterprisenow you should see something super coolwhich is our attack path simulation itpicked up a number of things for uswe've got a secure service account keythat's available from the publicinternet I like these little red uhexclamation points here because itactually points to if we have otherrelated vulnerabilities there's kind ofthis fractally integrated set ofproblems in our account we can kind ofexplore that in any direction it's likeChoose Your Own Adventure it's allmapped out for us here in this nicelittle attack path simulation and itbrings us all the way down to our demobucket which is where we have our buildblog stored so all that build metadatawe were creating before is actuallypotentially exposed right now and thisis a good note that we need to fix itI'll be honest I feel like my mind justmelted a little bit here one of mylong-standing forward-wishing looklooking uh just goals for cloud overallto say hey AI just tell me which ofthese containers have vulnerabilitieswhich policies are over permission andjust give me the steps to remediate themdon't make me guess don't make me puttogether a bunch of toolsit really feels like we're starting toget theremy name is and I'm an engineeringmanager on the Google workspace team andthis spring my team wrapped up one ofthe biggest data migrations in thehistory of the planet and this is wherewe ran into the spaniclesspatacles is a cute name we gave ouredge casesbasically these Barnacles hanging ontothe side of our spanner migrationand now we're ready to see how the worldof data is changing I'm excited aboutthis one to help us with that I'd liketo invite one of my friends on stage alegendary Google Cloud Championinnovator miles Ward we figured thereare three big opportunities that arepresent first we have to simplify dataoperations and that's got to includesecurity we've got to put all that datato work be able to use it using thepower of AI and we want our cake and toeat it too we want our choice of thebest open source tools and managedservices so we don't have to do so muchwork so I did spin up we jumped to thescreen a typical data infrastructureusing the analytics lake house jumpstartsolution so to start off with first weactually populate a bunch of those moreaudio files in a cloud storage bucket soto work with them I've gone ahead andcreated a new object table in Big LakeI'm such a huge fan of how this biglength model it simplifies the securityoperations of working with data likethis so I've got a big query functionherethat goes ahead you can see next speechto text function this is actuallytranscribing the data from the audiofile and putting it in bigquery so let'sgo ahead and invoke that so I want torun this function so it's going to gothrough everything in that object tablelisten to the audio and then transcribeit for us it's a bunch of audiotranscription so using this model lookwhere we got all of the audio from thosefiles now right there okay so let's seeif you can get it to find like aspecific type of safety incident likemaybe all the reports that say injury orsomething right because I'm terrible atwriting SQL so when I can just give it acomment and have it give me a querystatement that's uh that's makingeverybody better let's see if we cantransform this data into something moreuseful I want to get out one of thebigquery studio notebooks for thisworkload I get and I hope you are too soexcited about this combination of OpenSource and manage tooling like yep giveme spark is the execution engine ifthat's what I want alongside bigquery asthe data repository or if I want to finetune an llm and pytorch you know Cloudtpus now support that I mean I couldbring in data from Apache Iceberg now ifI want to here's where it gets fun lookunder the hood bigquery studio notebooksare built on top of colab Enterprisethis is the cloud ready version ofGoogle collab notebooks that many of youhave known and loved for years let'sactually invoke the Palm API so we cansummarize Maybe that lengthy summarythere and get back a nice littledescriptionthat we can figure out which factoriesare a hot messoh there we go I think you showed me thelittle magic wand button if we come backwe see there's a summary I'm getting asingle sentence summary of what might bea really long transcription right I'mdoing all this in the data frame againI'm not leaving my tool set so everybodytake a minute to appreciate what justhappened we pulled in that vertexintegration no containers or extra sidecars we didn't stand up some giant modelor run it on a bespoke massive instancein order to get it close to our datait's it's just right there it's waitingin the platform for us it's an API acall awaywhen I started as a search enginemechanic at this little startup calledGoogleum it was natural to try and build it ontop of PCS because their priceperformance was still unbeatable and sowhen it came to copying a new web indexa new search index from one place toother add to another it was really hardto beat the bandwidth of a Honda full ofhard driveswhat's in a legacy today we've seen thatthe way we prototype our apps the way wemodernize our platforms secure ourworkloads even the assumptions we haveabout our data not choices that we haveto be trapped in in the past we canchallenge our assumptions even while wecelebrate what came beforeforeign"
