video games what's what do you sayso innoison take it away yeahforeignso let me start so Capcom is a gamecompany we have created many many gamesand some of the representative gameswould include Monster Hunter and StreetFighter seriesforeignso Street Fighter was first launched in1987 and so it's an IP with a very longhistory but we don't just take this uhsix of the number six game of the seriesso we have ahave additional attachment to this newlaunch and we have actually pioneeredthe genre of the fighting game but atthe same time we have started noticingthat the entryway is getting narrowerfor the newcomers of the the gamesmyselfso the with the nature of the fightinggameum this will involve fighting basicallyone player another versus another playerwill have to do the matching and thefighting and that will create the loserat the end of the game and that's thenature of the contents itself so thatcould be the challenge of this genrenext[Music]so when we decided to launch this newversion of Street Fighterfighter we didn't just want to renew thestreet fighter but we really wanted torenew the genre of the fighting game andmake sure that this genre is going to bemore enjoyable for the players foreignso uh with this IP we have sold thetotal total of 5200 units so far thatmeans that there are very differenttypes of players who would includepeople who used to play but no longerplaying or who just recently startedplaying the series or the type of peoplewho would only enjoy the fighting aspectof the game or people who would alsolove the characters and enjoy the worldview of this contentsforeignso we try to address all of the requestsand the hopes and wishes from all theusers in this new version and we packedthem in all in one game and we I alsomentioned earlier that the entryway isgetting narrower but I wanted to makesure that it's easier and one of the wayto address the complaint was to make thehungering the operation of the game thecommand operation is going to be easierwith the new oneuminstrumentsso um some of the core funds would havethe specific control just for this gamebut we also are offering this moderncontroller version which will allow forthe people who's using a genericcontroller to play this game easily andalso we used to have this the histhat used to require hours and hours ofpractice but we would we actuallyprepared this particular button thatallows for the beginner to also enjoythe special actionso umand when the players are not in the moodfor fighting they can also create theirown avatar and actually explore andenjoy the universe of the gameumand a lot of times the The Gamers wouldenjoy making new friends or online andspend time with them and so we preparethe battle Club this is a digital spacewhere you can make new friends andconnect with themumso I really tried our we really triedour best to incorporate all of therequests and fulfill all of The Wishesinto this game so please take a lookand this is our canvashere we Flex our style[Music]our creativityour skillswe come here to break roomsto Ben mineschange the gamethis is where we make an impression[Music]this is where we make our masterpieceavailable now all right love itso now I'd like to just spend a coupleminutes to talk about uh Google Cloudthe ecosystem for live games and theseare the Technologies empowering StreetFighter 6. so thank you very muchuh first and foremost Google Cloud forgames is an ecosystem for live games uhlive games are everywhere today and thisis largely because the proliferation ofmobile devices about 80 percent of theplanet today uh plays games or has amobile device which means that there'sabout three to four billion people onplanet Earth nearly half the planetplaying games right nowso these types of games have spread fromMobile to now PC and console in fact ifyou look at the highest grossing gamesfrom a revenue standpoint on PC andmobile they're all live games and onConsole it's not far behind in fact ifyou look at the games that the peopleare playing the most they're all livegames as well so it comes as no surprisethat today's hit games like StreetFighter 6 are live so what does it meanto be a live game it means that it's notjust enough to have people fall in lovewith the game but you need them to stayin love with the game live games are allabout providing content updates overtime understanding your playersunderstanding your audience so that theystick around and play for the Long Haulif you look at the future we expectanother half billion new players to comeinto the industry over the next fewyears these players are going to be alittle bit different because half ofthem are going to be playing on morethan one game platformso the opportunities for game creatorsare bigger but also more complex thanever beforeso our focus at Google Cloudspecifically for games is to provide anecosystem for these live games and thereare three core pillars to this ecosystemfirst and foremost are the game serversthese are the servers that allow gameplayers to connect and play together inreal time all over the world and thesehave to be Bulletproofscalable and super super fastsecond are the databases so these arethe systems that are tracking everythingthat's going on in the game so that allof the movements all the accomplishmentsfrom the millions of players are allstored seamlessly in the cloud and againat scale and securely and then finallyanalytics so from an analyticsstandpoint it's really important ifyou're running a live game to understandyour players understand your business sothat you can keep that constant wave ofnew content coming and new experiencescomingso these are the three pillars of ourecosystem for games there are many manyother solutions that we offer for gamedevelopers including partner Solutionsbut if you get these three things rightin a live game you're off to a greatstartso our mission at Google Cloud for gamesis to power everlasting love for yourgame again it's not enough to build agreat game these days and have playersfall in love you need to have a greatlive service platform behind that gameto make sure that game players keepcoming back for more so that they stayin love with your game and it's thismission that motivates us at Googleevery day and I couldn't be more proudto be here on stage with Capcom talkingabout live games in the context ofStreet Fighter I know the very the muchyounger version of me if you could seeme today would be would be very proud sothank you so much for making the tripout here and thank you so much foreverything you've done with StreetFightertell us a little bit about uh whatyou've donedeal with itsweet fighter fix the Google crowd inprevious implementationnext page pleasehere comes a new Challengerseat Fighter 5 had issues with thenetwork and many users were unable toplayStreet Fighter 6 had to have a stablelaunch without major troubleCapcom looked to Google Cloud to providethis stable launch across the worldlaunchoh next page launch was a perfect KOa gke was used to deploy Street Fighter6 ensuring players could always find aserverspanner was used to store game Statesdata ensuring it was always consistentand reliabletheFearless launch was a majorachievement for Capcom andtastement to the scalability andreliability of Google Cloud thank youthank you so muchand so now we come to q a I think we'redoing pretty good on time so we'veprepared a number of questions for ourfriends here at Capcom if there's sometime left over we will be here and youcan ask questions as well once we endthe presentationand let's kick off so first and foremostfor those of us not in the gamesindustry or that don't play games a lotcould you please describe what is Capcomforeignis a game company and we have some uhsomething that we reallyum how do you say treasure[Music]umforeigntake very good care of our fans and wealso want to make new fans and so wewant to make sure that our fans enjoyour games and so we also want to makesure that we always communicateimportant things to our fans those arethe things that you know we take themost energy into yeahuh you may think that I'm just talkingabout idealism or the dreamum and in the end only the Money Mattersuh but seriously taking care of our fanswill also lead to our success that'swhat we believewell as a longtime fan I think you guysare doing an amazing job I've been a fanmy entire life almostagain for those of us not in theindustry or not as familiar with gameswhat what is Street Fighter all aboutumso I already talked considerably on thestreet fighter series earlier so I don'tthink I have to go into the specifics somuch and if you're interested you youknow maybe you should talk to a produceror the creators or the designers howeveruh what I can say here is thatum we really really want people to startloving the street fighter as a gameit is[Music]foreignthe example is that the we do a lot ofcollaboration for this Street FighterseriesThe for example there's a apparel'sbusiness or it could be the the moviesand it could be the toys and we want toincrease the the opportunities fordifferent people to get to know StreetFighters and become a fan of this IP andthen they may eventually start playingthe game itself and that's one way ofmaking sure that we increase fundsokay this next one's a big question whatare fans of Street Fighter alike andwhat do they expect[Music]Edwhat the fans expectforeign[Music][Music]so we havewe have of the Street Fighter across theglobe and they like Street Fighters withall sorts of different reasons and butwe they really love the game they reallylove the street fighter and they wouldgive us all sorts of messagesum and that we share the feelings oflove just as our fans and that's why wewant to respond back with the best gamepossibleand what did you want to achieve withStreet Fighter 6.foreignforeign[Laughter]all sorts of different types of fans andto make sure that they have the greatestexperienceand as the series uh progressedum I think that the gamekind of gained some depth and so for thepeople who have been playing the streetfighters we want to provide a new typesof experience and for the people who gotto know the Street Fighter for the firsttime we want to make sure that thebeginners can have funumum soum I want I so my wish was to make surethat the people who uh haven't touchedthe street fighter Series in a whileredo it and find the new enjoyment anduh also the people who have never playedthe game got to know this and find theenjoyment and so as they play they wouldfall in love with the game withoutknowing that's what I wanted to do andmy confidence is that the the game weintroduced this time really allow fordifferent ways of enjoying and it's okayif you know each person plays a game ina different Manner and that's what I tryto achieve as a developerokayI ask you questions from here so thereare so many options of chrome servicebut uh why Google Cloud hosts do it forthe Sixersforeignso although Street Fighter 6 has anumber so it sounds like it's just asequel but actually our company wheneverwe launch a new title we treat it as anewum content so for this particularproject we have a different Mission wehad a different concept so we decided toselect the cloud with a zero base and itso happened that that the Google Cloudwas the bestasideand since our time is limited I cannotgo into too deep about the technicalaspect but we will have differentopportunities and we also have MrNakajima who was a lead developer so youcan ask him questions as welljust don't challenge him at StreetFighter you will not winokay next question uh socould you tell me the detail of thebattle half so why is that is itimportant to Street 46oh hiumforeign[Music]we care a lot about our fans and ourcommunity and it is important for usthat they enjoy the game and that theyget the best experience possiblehey[Music]and uh for this title there's a singleplayer mode which is a world tour modeand we also have the Dual mode which isa fighting ground and we also have themultiple player uh Hub which is a battlehubisso the battle Hub is not just a digitalLobby this is a virtual space where thepeople who gathered in that space canplay in different ways just like uh theactual game arcadeso how do you seek to further innovatethe street fighters let's seeforeigncupsI knowmy story is tomorrowum so in terms of which direction we aretrying to innovate there are many thingsthat we cannot disclose hereforeign[Laughter][Music]uh so there are all sorts of fans uhthere are many fans and we provide thevirtual space and there are differentstoriesimages freshly launchedbut I really want to provide theopportunity for all the fans tofind the ways that they can do whateverthey want to do and my belief is that asthe series progresses we will make surethat the game becomes better and as longas the series continues I am determinedto take responsibility for providing thebest gameso I really welcome feedbacks from allthe users and playersokay thank you so the next question so Iknow the development process isimportant for the gaming company but uhlaunch is also important so uh how didyou prepare for the launch of StreetFighter 6.again I can't really go into too muchtechnical detail and that's going to bedone by Mr nakazimais[Music]that we try to maximum the usage of themanaged service of the Google cloud andwe try to eliminate the areas where wedon't utilize the managed servicesand Street Fighters 6 is a long uh thecontent that we foresee that many yearsuh the con the content will continue toexist so making sure that the operationis smooth and easy that is veryimportant for usumso taking advantage of the managerservice will lead to more time for us todo something creative so rather thantaking painstaking time doing thedevelopment or the um taking care of theissues or with the operation we can takeuse that time for creative things tomake more fun thingsforeign[Music]I think that way of thinking was veryvery helpful in leading to this success[Laughter]good luck okayso this is the last question so Street26 has a lot of charactersso which characteryou right the bestvery important very difficult questionsyou can extend your rims and you canblow your blue fire and you can teleportlooks goodthousand[Laughter]what is your character what's your mainumit's a very difficult question to answerbut let's see I would pick Kimberlyforeign[Laughter]thank you so much for coming I reallyreally appreciate the time and a specialthank you to our friends from Capcom whomade the trip all the way out here thankyou so much it's been such a pleasureworking with you all so far and I can'twait to see what we're able to dotogether next so thank you so muchthink right there[Music]"
