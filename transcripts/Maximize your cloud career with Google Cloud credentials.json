start of this conversationninety percent of it leaders want togrow their Cloud environments in thenext several yearswhat this means there's so much Demandon cloud so much Demand on the keywordof the conference gen AI right so muchopportunity like so much and thebusinesses want to embrace it from thetechnology standpoint so what does itmean for for us and the talent side ofthe equation rightof leadersfeel that they have a lack of skills andtalent among the employees right so allthis demand for technology but where isthe skill set where is the talent evenmore need to develop this capacity ofskilled individuals who can solvebusiness problems with the technology sovery powerful I think Trends and datapoints we see that we can ground ourtoday's conversation inI also think really interesting datapoint that's outlined here that morethan a third of tech leaders said thatprofessionals with Cloud skills are themost challenging to find right so inthis entire technical skill setecosystem the cloud skills the AI skillswill be so very important to develop andto to provide so that's the space we areinour solution our offer to all of you andto the businesses islet's build this skill set and let'svalidate the skill set with credentialswith certifications so that's really theframeworkof the core technology areas or the keyjob roles that are in demand that weneed to build these capabilities aroundand that's really what the certificationand credentials programs are for rightthey really validate the skills andknowledge that the businesses need thatthe individuals build their careersaroundso specifically the core two credentialtypes that we offer Google Cloud areGoogle Cloud skill badges how many ofyou perhaps earned the generative AIskill batch that we've been
