heard of cloud SQLokay greatum keep your hands up if you're alreadyusing itstill a big portion that's awesome wellso for those of you who have experiencethe good news is that we're going totalk about a lot of new things todayfor those of you who are less familiarwe will still be going over some of thebasics though which is going to be agreat contentand I think it's safe to say that you'rein the right place to kind of explorehow our managed databases deliver on thesessions title achieving strongersecurity maximizing the value of yourInvestments and streamlining youroperationstoday I'll be presenting with mycolleague hi I'm ioff I am from productmarketing for databases at Google Cloudandstarting at Google for first in Googleads and for the last few years in GoogleCloud so I'm super excited for thechance to talk to you all todayso why are we focusing on security costefficiency and simplicitywell we know that there's some of thebiggest challenges you're facing todaya recent survey asked leaders at 250small and medium-sized businesses torate the importance of a variety ofbusinesses business challenges thatthey're facingeighty percent of those leaders ratedmanaging costs as a very importantbusiness challenge82 said the same about keeping theirdata and applications secure and 74agreed about maximizing the productivityof their employeesa problem that can really be exacerbatedby outdated technology and complicatedoperationsnow these aren't probably verysurprising to you but they do paint aclear picture about how importantdigital transformation is to stayingcompetitive and being able to ultimatelyovercome these challengesand gen AI adds a brand new dimension tothis idea of digital transformationgen AI has changed the game in a lot ofways but those three challenges for smbsremain really consistentand I'm sure you're familiar with someof the ways Janae I can improve youroperations not least because of uh thewonderful presentations we've heard sofar this conferencefrom task automation to even codegenerationand we also know that there might besome apprehension to adopting JediSolutionsin recent interviews we actuallyconducted with smbs three common themesbecame apparentfirst we heard a lot about concerns withdata security especially within theprivacy and legal constraints of eachindustrysecond we heard about the uncertaintywith costs with most people assuming ahefty price tag for actually a dollar AISolutionsand last we did hear about concerns withhow complicated it may be to actuallyadopt these Solutions and the need forthe right resources andindustry-specific use cases to get youthereso to solve for these challenges you'renot going to make these huge HardwareInvestments and build on-prem rightwe're looking to the cloudin a session we're specifically thinkingabout databases and how you run yourdatabases in the cloudit's essential that your databases candeliver on continuous availability andhigh reliabilityyour customers expect your apps to workaround the clock and that puts a lot ofpressure on your database experts tokeep the engines of those apps thedatabases running all the timeand behind the need for continuousavailability you need databases thathave security you can trustdata breaches are increasing year overyear as is the cost to remediate thosedata breachesso you need databases that can providereal-time threat detection automated andon-demand backups as well as auditingauthentication and encryptionnext you're looking for databases thatcan provide a strong level ofintegration so if you're usingworld-class databases with tons of datayou want to be able to generate insightsthat can really power your businessyou want databases that can act like aunified data platformwith ML and AI capabilities built inlastly you want databases that go beyondfully managedgone are the days of having an army ofadmins or even devs working around theclock to keep the lights on doingconfiguring patching scaling themselvesthe next generation of databases gobeyond they're helping devs Drivebusiness value and become moreintelligent about their applicationsdatabases and how they're able to managethe dataso that's where Google Cloud comes inour managed database service portfoliois designed to provide coverage whileminimizing complexitywe're in a unique position at Googlebecause of our Decades of first-handexperience developing one-of-a-kinddatabase systems that provide massivescalability reliability and security foryour applications from the sameunderlying architecture that powers mostof our most popular products likeYouTube search and maps10 to 20 years ago the entire Market wasrelational but new types of databasesmostly the node SQL ones you see here onthe righthave gained a lot of popularitybut in the last five to ten yearsrelational databases have been making apretty serious comeback and a hugepercentage of those use cloud SQLthat's why today we're focusing on cloudSQL our fully managed relationaldatabase servicefrom our earlier discussion I know a lotof you are using Cloud SQL already butI'll do a quick overview for those whoare less familiarclass equal is a fully managed databaseservice with full compatibility forMySQL postgresql and SQL Serverit simplifies database management andmakes it easy to set up operate andscale your relational databaseit provides Enterprise grade dataProtection security and governance andis trusted by thousands of organizationsgloballyin fact over 95 percent of GoogleCloud's top 100 customers use cloud SQLand over 1 million gke pops connect toCloud SQLit's built with devs in mind be APIfirst and providing application-centricobservability to your team to moreeffectively monitor troubleshoot and fixissues with your applicationsokaythanks Sarah thanks for thatintroduction and uh with oh it's alittle hard to read thethe textum soum thanks for that and with thatintroduction what we want to do is to goover the main use cases or scenariosthat uh you might find yourself uh whenyou adopt databases in the cloud andlet's uh drill down a little bit intoevery one of these uh fourum for use cases so the first one iswhen you do database migrations and youbasically you do what everybody callslift and shift where you just takebasically the database the rest of theapplication stack and you just move itto the cloud pretty much as is so we'lltalk a little bit about that the secondcase is when you do what we calldatabase modernization so youessentially move the application to thecloud but you take that as anopportunity to make some changes maybeto replace the database with the newerone maybe to change some code and we'lltalk a little bit about that the thirdone is when you're not migrating yourapplication from anywhere you're justactually building it in the cloud andthat's an opportunity to know to add genAi and a lot of other things and we'lltalk a little bit about that and thelast one is when you didn't even writethe application yourself you're justadopting an application from anotherlet's say a software vendor andthe application runs on one of thesedatabases postgres SQL Server MySQL andyou need a solution for running thatdatabase in the cloud so we'll talk alittle bit about that so I think kind ofby definition these are really the fourscenarios is there anything that is noton the list let me know if there'ssomething that's not included here Ithink these are pretty much this ispretty much an exhaustive list and we'lltry to focus more on what's new sincemany of you already know Cloud SQL andthat's what we expected so we'll talk alittle bit about a little bit more aboutwhat's new in the last year or so orlet's say since the last uh Cloud nexteventokayum so let's start uh with databasemigrations we talked about security costefficiency and ease of use so let's govery quickly over these things so forsecurityum obviously the first thing that uh youwould need is uh is a is encryptionacross the board encryption of the databetween the application and the databaseencryption of the data that we store ondisk and the option to also use your ownencryption keys if you want a higherlevel of security or if you're in aregulated industry that requires that soall these options are availablethe second thing is authentication andauthorization so basically being able tocontrol who has access to your dataand for that we generally recommend ourIAM cloud service for managing and youcan also use the built-in security thatexam this in each one of these databaseengines and then finally logging andauditing you can send all the logs tothe centralized log service on Googlecloud and manage and get alerts forthings that go wrong so all of thesethings are much easier to do with themanage database than if you were to justyou know install one of these databasesyourself and set all of that up and setup the encryption and the logging andall these things it's much easier if youjust take advantage of what we offerhereum next uh point we wanted to bring upis around cost efficiency so we actuallydid a survey with IDC last year uh tosee uh how much people are benefitingfrom moving from an identical databaseengine to I mean from a database engineto the same engine in Google Cloud sofor example people who were managingMySQL on their own whether in the cloudor not and then they moved to Cloud SQLand let the product you know just do allthe administration backups and upgradesand all of that andum there and by the way most of thecustomers in the survey were smaller andmedium businesses I think maybe all ofthem except maybe one or two so thisshould be pretty representative of theresults that you can expect to get soum got some really nice numbers some ofthem are here for example 246 Roi inthree years uh meaning you know if youspend a dollar on cloud SQL then you canexpect to get to a dollar 1046 centsback within three years so that plus thetime to uh you know until uh the breakeven was 11 months and there were abunch of other data points in the surveywhich you can just download from thelink that you see here so you know howmany databases can be managed by asingle database administrator forexample which is obviously much higherif everything is automated soum in the past you know oneadministrator I think managed maybe 10databases or something like that and nowit's up to dozens or hundreds ofdatabases per person so things you cantake into account in terms of costefficiencyum the other thing we wanted to mentionand this is actually the first time I'mmentioning something which is new so wehave this these little icons at the topum there is a new edition in case youmissed it of cloud SQL that came out weannounced it about two months ago Ithink called Enterprise Plus and that isessentially for your higher endapplications or the ones that need ahigher level of reliability andperformance so the existing Cloud SQLthat you've been using uh for all theseyears is now called the EnterpriseEdition and that's just that that justremains um as is with no changes nochange in pricing Etcdefinitely that's still a good fit for alot of applicationsum if it gives you what you need youknow you can save the money and use theEnterprise Edition if you want a higherlevel of reliability like four ninesplus performance improvements in readand write in certain cases and longerretention of data which you might needfor security or auditing purposes thentake a look at the Enterprise PlusEdition so again this is an optionalupgrade for those of you who need itum and then finally we talked a littlebit about ease of use already but I justwanted to also highlight the ease ofmigration so um our database migrationservice which is a product that uh youcan use separately from cloud SQL willbasically like we called it lift andshift your databases uh from whereverthey are can be in the cloud can be onpremises anywhere else into Cloud SQL soit will move all your data over and thenyou can cut over when the data is readyand when the two instances are synced soif you're doing a cloud migration take alook at that it's free for migrations toCloud SQL so one one of the nicestthings is that it's completelyserverless so it manages all of themigration resources on its own right soif you need CPU power there's someprogram that's running there and it'scopying the data over all of that iscompletely serverless you don't need tomanage any resources and it doesn't costanything to use itso take a look at thatand then uh uh finally on the topic of Iwould say all of these things securityand ease of use and cost efficiency Iwant to recommend no pun intended afeature called Cloud SQL recommenderswhich is uh built into the product andprovides various recommendations aroundperformance securitycost and availability so for exampleit'll tell you whether you have idleresources that are not in use you knowyou have a database that hasn't beenaccessed for a long time so it alertsyou to that you can shut it down ifnobody's using it it alerts you toPerformance problems and securityproblems like you know really broad IPaccess like you have you know you'veopened up your database to any IPaddress on the on the internet probablynot what you meant so all kinds ofsecurity things like that that you mighthave missed you can get through theserecommenders some of them are in previewsome of them are released so definitelyrecommend it and that's something thatagain this is something that with the uhwith a managed database it's much easierto have things like that than when youmanage databases on your ownum and then uh finally I wanted to uhhighlightum one of our customers called songkickwho has been a cloud SQL uh customer fora long time they've actually migratedtheir databases over and um you can readall the all the details later butbasically we're going to bring someexamples of customers that haveum and that are roughly the size of thecompanies that we have here in theaudienceum okay so with that we want to move onto the next topic which is modernizationwhere you are essentiallymoving your database over but alsomaking some changes along the way soSarah over to you thank you yeah so thegoal here is to transition off yourlegacy proprietary databases andmodernize your applications with opensourceso when you're embarking on aheterogeneous database migrationmigration of course is just half thestory because you'll have to actuallyconvert the databaseour database migration service thatyou'll have mentioned supports thoseheterogeneous Oracle the postgres SQLmigrations meaning you can migrate yourOracle workloads from anywhere to CloudSQL from postgresql this is a newcapability moving from preview toGeneral availability and assists inmodernizing your migrated workloadsthis conversion enables you to reduceyour dependence on Legacy databases andlower costs overallyou'll also be able to tap intoserverless and secure data movement andmonitoringand although this is great there's stilla good portion of manual interventionit's really exciting that we're inpreview actually though with new endproduct capabilities of built-in codeand schema conversionso to double click on that last point ifyou look carefully here you'll see abunch of objects like tables andfunctions here on the left in an Oracledatabase that need to be convertedthis of course is typically quite thechallenge because the two databases aredifferentbut we recently announced this newcapability currently in preview thatconverts them for you this is a big stepin our modernization capabilities mostproducts of this kind have a less thanideal UI and require a lot of extramanual steps so the idea behind thisInnovation is to provide a simple easyexperience to enable your team tomodernize faster and more effectivelyso if you're able to convert most ofyour data what about the restwell even fresher we just announced abrand new gen AI capability that canhandle that for youhere we're using duet AI to look at yourOracle functions and convert them intopostgresqlthe user experience is exactly the sameas the previous feature but this isgetting us even closer to that fullconversion with Gen AIthis is a really cutting edgedevelopment that can help you furtherreduce time spent on migration andconversion so we're really excited tooffer this new capabilityokay thank you very muchum let us go into the next topic whichisumsorry which is uh building newapplicationsum on top of Cloud SQL soum you know the whole topic of you knowhow you build applications in the cloudand how you use a database I mean it's ahuge topic which is obviously much morethan we can come you know that we cancover here so what we were thinking islet's talk specifically about some ofthe main themes that have been in thisat this event and we want to talk abouthow you make your application datadrivenwhich is uh you can look at that in twoways one is how do you use the data thatthe application collects in the databasein order to make you know to give theuser interesting feedback and things youknow they need to know as part of usingthe application and the other side of itis for you as a company running theapplication how you can analyze thatdata and you know get business insightsinto that so we thought we would focuson those things uh specifically so let'sum let's let's start with analytics sobasically in the analytics use case uhbased you would typically have adatabase such as you know my SQLpostgres SQL Server that is that istransactional that the application isbased on and it's saving all of the datain the database and separately from thatyou might have a data warehouse such asum you know bigquery in the case ofGoogle cloud and you would uh want tokind of use data from both of them inorder to get better business insightsand provide better information to theuser so the classic example I think likeeverywhere I look is always everyoneuses the same example is that on thetransactional side you have sales ordersso you know there's some applicationthat's putting all the sales orders intothe database so that would be in thiscase on the cloud SQL side and then youhave customer data which you've analyzedand which who are my best customers andyou know what is every customer done andwho's most likely to buy whatand things like that and that'sanalytics that would be in bigquery inthis example so the question is like howcan you combine both of those datasources to ask questions that go acrossboth so who of which of my bestcustomers has done so and so bought aspecific product so that question goesacross both data both of these datastores right so I want to recommend twoways to do that and some of them havebeen recently updated so you can take alook if you're building anything likethatthe first option is to use what's calledFederated queries where basically youcan run a query in bigquery that willalso look at data in Cloud SQL so youcan query across both data sources andget a result in bigquery and then youknow continue and do your work whateveryou're analyzing in bigquery so that'sone way to do it you can find all ofthat in the documentation of bothproductsum the second option is to stream thedata so it's a little bit like videostreaming um so streaming in the sensethat all the changes that get made inCloud SQL all of those transactions getstreamed almost right away into oralmost in real time into bigquery andnow all the data is in bigquery and youcan just continue with a you knowanalytical query in bigquery so then youcan run any any query that you want soessentially like if you don't know aheadof time what queries you're going towant then maybe it's good to stream allof the data so that you have it all inone place and now you can do queriesthat go across both of these types ofdata so things to uh to think about inyour next projectum second thing we wanted to talk aboutwas gen AI so if any of you think thatyou know you've come here and youhaven't heard enough about gen AI inthis conference then I can fix it nowI'm just kidding soum a few things that are important toknow about building gen AI applicationsso if you write a chat bot and you knowyour first chatbot might look somethinglike this so by the time the chatbotgets to the to the second question itdoesn't even remember what you asked inthe first what you what you talked aboutin the first question right so uh whichuh the capital of which country becauseum the models that you use for Gen AIessentially don't have any memory so youcall them they give a result and they goon to the next call that somebody elsemight call them and you know a modellike the ones behind Bard or chat GPT orall those um those applications theydon't remember all of the queries of allthe people who called them try to thinkhow much memory how much storage youwould need in order they would need inorder to do that so you as anapplication writer you're writing a chatbot you need to handle all those thingsand you need to store all that data so adatabase like the one we're talking theones we're talking about here areperfect for that so that helps you toprovide bothumI would so we would say three things oneis to provide relevant data so this inthis example the capital of Francedoesn't change very often but if thequestion was you know how many units ofwhatever do you have in inventory thenyou know you want to look it up in thedatabase right so you need to provideaccurate information to give an accurateresponse the second thing is to have thecontext right so the chatbot needs toremember what you were just talkingabout and you um and you also want it tobe easy to use and especially like ifyou're a small business you know youneed uh or medium business you need easyto use tools that will help you to dothatsoum you might have heard a lot at thisevent that everythingum in the uh in the in the Gen AI worldis essentially did I click too muchdid accidentally clickno okayumwe're good so uh basicallyum you might have heard that in the GenAI world everything is stored as vectorsso all of the questions all of theanswers all of the inputs intoum into into gen AI models are stored asvectors which you might remember likefrom algebra algebra in high school soum what was what's been added todatabases in the last uh few months andyears is the ability to store vectors topass these vectors alongum in Cloud SQL for postgres weannounced that a few months ago that itsupports PG Vector which is a verypopular package in postgres databasesfor managing vectors so you can searchfor them you can look up information youcan add information to the responsethat's basically how you do the like thelayer under the chatbot in order tostore information look it up and give itback to the modelum and wow this is the Texas is a way tomake the text like to make the slide onthe left bigger maybe because it'sa little hard to see like which slidewe're on sorry about thatumokayumum so we want to mention one otheraspect of gen AI which is also uh beingadded to our database products which isusing um duet AI as the assistant tohelp you to do the develop yourdevelopment work so in Cloud SQL weannounced this was just you know a fewdays ago that you will be able to usenatural language as you're developing anapplication in Cloud SQL to do some ofthe work toum you know to help you with yourqueries and with developing your datamodel as a database developer so you cango and say you know if you have a youknow you're building a game and you havea list of winners in the game and youcan say you know give me the list of thetop 10 uh winners of the game andthat'll generate a SQL query and you canput that into your application if youdon't remember the SQL syntax and thingslike that and similarly it can alsoupdate the data model so you know add amiddle name column to this table andit'll just go and it'll do the theoperation that will go and update thattable so all of these things are comingto duete we showed them for someproducts at this event and we're addingwe're rolling them out to otherdatabases including Cloud SQLand then finally Homedics anotherexample of a I would say medium sizedcustomer that has migrated to Cloud toum sorry that is built-in application inCloud SQL this is not an example of acompany that uses gen AI we wouldn't saythat because it's very new but they'vebeen uh happy and successful uh CloudSQL customer for a whileokay and with that we get to our lastcategory Sarah back to you thank you youhave yes we're at our fourth and finaluse case so this is third-partyapplications we know everybody wants toreduce the time and resources spent onthose TDS database Administration tasksso if you're running your third partydatabase on SQL server for example youneed to not only deploy the applicationbut also deploy the database withconfidence and especially as a small tomid-sized business you'll be more likelyto use maybe this third-partyapplication versus necessarily buildingyour own from scratchand we want to ensure our customers havethe best experience when deploying andusing their partner solution of choicealong with our database services likeCloud SQLthat's why it's super exciting for us toannounce Google cloud ready Cloud SQLthis Google cloud ready designationrecognizes partner products that workwell with Cloud SQL and I've met a coreset of functional and interoperabilityrequirementsyou'll notice there is a lot of databasetool vendors on this slide if you'recurrently using these tools to manageyour databases the good news is thesetools will continue to work the way youknow them tooand the idea behind this initiative isto help our customers reduce costsassociated with product evaluation andfocus more time on modernizing yourdatabase Solutions and applications thatwill drive faster data to value for yourbusinessand that brings us to the end of ourpresentation today thank you all again[Applause]thank you"
