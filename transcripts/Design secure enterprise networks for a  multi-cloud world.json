Guptagroup product manager with Google Cloudnetworking I have an incredible line ofspeakers here with me to share the stageand we'll make sure that the next 45minutes are worth your time and we willmake sure that you get to the party ontime all right do I have everybody'sattentionokay awesomeso you've heard about cross CloudNetwork in the executive Keynotesearlier in the weekso in this session uh we would like touh you know go a bit deeper into whattrust fund working is what cross CloudNetwork can do to transform how youbuild applications how you deliver thoseapplications in a secure Manner and howdo you optimize experience for your endusers as you build and deliver theseGlobal applicationsyeahso here is our line of presenters I'mjoined with some of my esteemedcolleagues we have some partners andcustomers as well uh who will join thestage and they will talk about theirexperiences uh working with us andworking with our Solutionsso let's just start with some contextand a lot of this is probably a recap ofuh you know what you heard in theprevious sessions we had an arc 201 thismorning where we where we talked aboutsome of the key challenges that we arefocusing on as we are thinking throughbuilding this cross-cloud networkingplatform right so a lot of you havemoved your applications to the cloud andas you did that you built networkingsolutions to connect your on-premnetworks to your Cloud Networks and asyou added more clouds these networkingSolutions became complex so thesenetworking solutions could be likeyou've built collocations you've builtother Regional aggregation points or youknow whatever your choice of thenetworking solution wasand from a security perspective a lot ofour customers they started withdeploying their on-prem firewalls intothese co-locations where they were doinginter-cloud multi-cloud connectivityand for the cloud workloads you knowthere was a choice you could go with thecloud native providers uh you know NATOsecurity controls or you could gothrough the operational complexity ofdeploying these third-party virtualfirewalls into your Cloud environmentsso in either case uh networking waschallenging it was expensive and from asecurity perspective you lost visibilityto your traffic as that traffic crossedthe cloud boundaries so this is one atthe core of you know some of theproblems that we looked at as we builtthis platformsecondly when you know you want todeliver these platforms now you have tobuild your Global front ends so whatthis does is it opens up a huge threadsurface for your applications which arenow exposed to internet-based threatsand which as we all know these threatsare increasing both in volume andsophistication as the Bad actors outthere are increasingly using AI basedtools to create a new variant of thethread every few minutes so how do wemake sure that you know as you aredelivering these applications over theinternet you are staying ahead of thoseBad actors in terms of securing your ownassets that are running in these publicCloud environmentsand finding your Workforce right so weall are familiar with the growth in thehybrid Workforce and we all know that alot of you have uh adopted best of breedsecurity providers in order to secureaccess for those mobile users to yourEnterprise environments so while youknow the secure Services its solutionsthey provide you with the best of leadsecuritythe one challenge that you know a lot ofcustomers have told us that they havefaced is around application experiencebecause the SSC providers are usinginternet-based connectivity to connectback into your Enterprise applicationsafter they have inspected the usertraffic coming into their environmentso if you kind of put all of thistogetherwhat you see iswork of multipleoften built together by using solutionsfrom different vendorsit is very complexyou see inconsistent security it is veryhard to manage your security posture inthis kind of an environment and plusyou're also dealing with you know thesoaring costs of this networkyeahso what if you could build yourapplications by using any service thatmet your needs in any environment thatyou wanted so consider a scenario whereyou built an application in Cloud a andnow you want to use bigquery or spannerservices to further enhance thecapability of that application or youhave your data on-prem and you want touse that data to train your aim andmodel running in gcp right what if youcould deliver these applications to yourGlobal users and you could turn on MLbased security out of the boxand what if you could do all of thiswithout impacting the applicationexperience for your end users and thatis really the goal for us as we thoughtthrough building cross Cloud NetworkplatformGlobal networking platform that offerson-demand any to any connectivity tobring these distributed applicationscloser to each otherthe ability to turn on ML based securityfor any traffic flow app to app user toapp app to internetand to provide that optimal experiencefor your applications when thoseapplication backends could be storecould be running in any Cloudenvironmentso now let's take a deeper look of atsome of the key attributes of thisplatformso we understand that youyou might like to be logged in by goodenough vendor Security Solutionslike some of our other Cloud providersare forcing you to doour philosophy is a little differentwe believe in giving flexibility andchoice to our customers to be able tochoose which security provider they wantto work withand this is where we are investing veryheavily in developing very deepIntegrations with a broad partnerecosystem so that we are able to offeryou these third-party services in Googlecloud in the same manner as we offer anyfirst party serviceour latest addition to our partnerecosystem are sassy providers Prismaaccess from Palo Alto networks andbroadcom semantic secured web Gatewaysolution where you can now turn on sassyservice within your own VPC in gcp as agcp native service without having to gothrough complex routing changes toenable these services for yourenvironment and we're extending the sameIntegrations across our NG firewallplatform uh NG firewall Partners we haveexisting Partnerships with sd-wan uh andother uh industry leading routingPartners so you have the flexibility tobring in your traffic in any way usingour Partnerships turn on any third-partyfirewall solution or uh SSC solution inour environmentwe also know that as you deploy yourGlobal front-ends for serving thoseinternet based applications you want tobring in your choice of API security youwant to bring in your own bot managementsolution or any other third-partyservices for that matter for your owncustom needs your own compliance needssecurity needs or any other businessneeds and this is where we areintroducing data plane extensions intoour CDN and load balance of productswhere you can either customize usingsome simple lines of code if if that'sthe way you want to goor you can work with any of our thirdparty partners and insert those Servicesvery easily as you roll out this Globalfront end with gcpso quick quick questionwho can tell me which gcp serviceprotected against the largest DDOSattack that we have seen in the last 12monthsI'll give you a hintthe customer got got impacted withbroadcomCloud armor perfect thank youCloud armor was the first Cloud nativewav service to offer ml based DDOSprotection in the industry to protectagainst zero day DDOS attacks and wecontinue to invest in the space bybuilding more ml models to provide youmore coverage for different types ofattacks that you see you know when youare deploying these applications anddelivering these applications over theinternetbut we also know that security is thebest of breed market and there areexisting Pure Play vendors who haveinvested years and years in buildingthat threat until and building bringingthat threat Intel into their productsand into their Solutionsso we are also investing in partneringwith the market leaders to bring intheir services into our environment as agcp native serviceNG firewall service that we announcedthis week is a classic example of ourpartnership with Palo Alto networkswhere we brought in their Advancedthreat protection as a native service ingcp within our Cloud distributed Cloudfirewall stackthe other cool um the other cool youknow aspect of our securitycapability as part of this platform issomething that the security teamsstruggle with a lot in terms ofcompliance auditing and overall managingand monitoring the network securitypostureso with all these distributed uh thiswith all these disjointed tools and uhproducts it's very very hard for asecurity uh a security team to know whatthe security posture is of this hybridenvironment so with our odd levelpolicies non-security teams canMonitor and maintain the networksecurity posture that is acceptable toyour organization for your line ofbusiness and they can audit uh and theycan uh you know plan for conformance tocertainum standards that your business requiresthrough our odd level policies and ourpolicy different constructs and they cando so at scale because we do not requiresecurity teams to be requiring routingdesign changes to your network if youhave to insert something simple as alayer 4 or layer 7 firewall in yourtraffic so any security control that youwant to turn on in gcp Cloud you can dothat with the security policy withouthaving to ever rethink about yournetwork designand while you do all of thisyou can be assured that it would notimpact the experience of yourapplications that could be running indifferent environments so cross Cloudnetworks makes Google's Planet scalebackbone available for you to use andbuild your Enterprise Network on top ofthatand with our extensive peerings with ourisps SAS vendors our broadest presenceacross more than 200 countries andterritories we provide the bestapplication experience for anyapplication that you're hosting inGoogle cloud or in any other environmentwith optimal application experienceand Google's intelligent routing willguarantee the best path to steer yourtraffic anywhere in your environmentso with cross Cloud Network you caneasily consume any gcp service to buildyour distributed applications anywhereand we provide you a very scalableservice based networking architecture tobuild these applicationsyou can deliver your distributedapplications with ML based securityturned on by default with a cloud armorserviceand you can standardize on your securityprovider for Workforce security be itSSC or any other stack that you that youwish to use to secure all your hybridWorkforce and at the same timeoptimizing the experience for yourprivate applicationscross Cloud network is realand our customers are already using itto accelerate their business goalsso I would like to invite Tom and Victorto tell us more about how Priceline isusing cross Cloud Network to resolvesome of these challenges and we'll gothrough the detailsthank you Manishaso good afternoon thanks for joining usum that was a great review of the CrossCloud Network I have the privilege ofsharing the stage here with Tom todayTom is a principal network engineer atPriceline and Tom has a lot ofexperience building networks and hasbeen on a journey to actually takePriceline into cloud in the last fewyears Tom you want to tell us a littlebit about Priceline yeah thanks Victorhi everybody thanks for coming outtonight Priceline is an online travelagency who's been in business for thelast 25 years we help our customersexperience the moments that matterthrough great deals on hotels flightsrental cars vacation packages and morethanks thanks Tom so we're going to lookin more detail at the cross CloudNetwork and we're going to look mainlyat three use cases we're going to lookat building distributed applications asManisha alluded to we're looking atbasically combining the best of anyresources you may have in any of thesedifferent networks that we'reinterconnecting and then we'll talk alittle bit about how we actually takethose distributed applications anddeliver them out on the internet andlast but not the least what we do toactually secure hybrid Workforceso with that in mind let's go into thedistributed application and how weassemble this so at the foundation ofdelivering these distributedapplications is connectivity so thefirst thing that we need to optimize ishow we actually provide thatconnectivity and we're evolving ourinterconnect product to give youcross-cloud interconnect which isbasically a point-to-point connectiondirectly between Cloud providers so youdon't have to manage a router in acollocation and hop through that routerto interconnect Cloud providers we goback to back it's a fully manageddelivery system where you can actuallyget a letter of authorization from thepeer provider and Google Cloud will takecare of all of all the umall the setup for you now why is thisimportant and why is this relevant wellfirst we want to simplify what you'redoing in those collocations but moreimportantly by going back to back youcan enable maxic and now you get privacythat you didn't have before in theseconnections because you're bypassingthese uh routers in the way your latencycould presumably be lower but whatreally makes it lower is the fact thatthere's a global footprint ofcollocations where you can actuallycreate these connections and you cancreate connections where you really needthem where they really are going toreduce your latency and lastly we canguarantee99.99 availability for your services sowhen you look at that whole combinationyou're now looking at a very trustworthyset of connections that start makingthis multi-network network networks behave as if it was one backbone andin one backbone you can do things thatyou couldn't do before now you've gotlatency considerations that thatprevented you from doing things beforethat you can actually overcome privacyand so forth sothat's the very heart of this now onceyou have this available your developersare going to want to create services ontop of this and one of the key tools isload balancing we've extended our loadbalancing to actually include hybridresources resources that are in otherclouds by using what we call the Hybridnext the Hybrid next actually caninclude in the back ends of the loadbalancers basically resources on all ofthese other clouds nowthat is not sufficient because we wantto make this Global so we also haveintroduced the global backends whichmeans our backends can now cut across amultitude of regions so all the benefitsof actually Health checking on theresources are now extended to resourcesthat are in other clouds over these fastlinks so now it starts looking likeyou've actually expanded the scope ofyour cloudall in one and lastly you're going tohave to have access to private servicesor to apis in general right and we wantto do that in a private manner we don'twant to go out to the internet to get tothese services that we've gone throughall the work to actually create thisnetwork so with PSE you can actuallycreate a private presence for all theseservices and access the services fromwherever you may be in this Federationof networks whether it's from on-premanother cloud provider or natively fromGoogle Cloudnow once you've assembled your servicesyou can also choose to publish them forconsumption by other organizations andyou can basically attach PSC as a frontend to the applications that you'vecreated with resources that aredistributed across multiple cloudsso very interested to hear how Pricelinecan leverage some of these toolsyeah definitely so Priceline started ourCloud Journey several years ago and youknow right away we saw the benefit ofleveraging the interconnect product lineto help us scaleum our infrastructure building a securehybrid Cloud architecture rightTransforming Our workloads with thepower of Google Cloud's technologyattached to our data centers I'm excitedto hear that you're including the crossCloud connectivity in that piece we haveworkloads and other clouds that'schallenging to manage that connectivityand I believe we'll be able to leveragethat ina ton of use cases as soon as I starteduh start my way back home the benefitsof encryption with maxic is somethingthat we've had to do internally fordifferent Regulatory and compliancereasons we handle a lot of personal dataand payment data and go through a numberof regulatory and compliance exercisesso definitely we'll see the benefit ofthat my infosec team I'm sure is goingto be excited to hear that that's apossibility for us with Google cloud andobviously you know the predictablelatency and dynamic scaling of thatNetwork fabric is very important youknowright away from the beginning of ourmigration we had large-scale datatransfers and how do I enable teams tostart transforming their workloads rightaway and being able to meet that scalingwithout having to invest a lot of timeand energy andumbuild new relations with a whole bunchof different partners that'll reallyenable us to continue to flex out ourinfrastructure so go to your point threehere PSC and even PSA has been huge inour Ai and ml enablement for Pricelinewe'reyou know right now building out a ton ofgenerative AI features including achatbot where you just brought to Marketcalled Penny which will help customerstransform their travel book experiencegiving them ways to personalize theirtravel experience and help them findgreat discounts so that's been reallyawesome it's been obviously a huge topicthroughout the past couple of days soit's been you know really exciting beingable to leverage things like vertex Aiand Bard to help us with internal searchforthe uh crazy amount of documentation andthe uh you know separated data sets isalso very important soumyou know the the combination of thecross-cloud interconnect the PSC beingable to connect my data sets and otherclouds is a really powerful storyum continuing with those themes ofresilience and performance powering allof that I think it's going to provide agreat value to us and your othercustomersso we can go into our next slide here wecan talk a little bit about I'm excitedabout Penny yeah it's very cool I wantto I want to see that weprobably need Penny to push on this bythe wayhere we go yeah absolutelyumso you know Victor and I have beentalking about this for a while andthought it would be a great idea to giveyou uh some understanding of thearchitecture at Priceline we have amulti-regional architecture withvpcs and uh you know we operate out ofseveral regionsum you know part of a great part of thatarchitecture includes the load balancerswith global access being able to makesure that our workloads are availablewhere we need them to be leveraging theinternal health checks and smart Networkrouting to complement the applicationrouting has been critical to the way weoperate our our stack it's definitely ahugely important part of our disasterrecovery and business continuityworkflow as well we're able to shifttraffic in and out of regions takeregions in and out of serviceand the global back end solution thatVictor mentioned in the previous slidewill be a great complement to that nownot only do I have front ends that areglobally available but now I can chooseback ends from other Cloud providers andother regions and how do I tie thosethings in where it makes the most senseyou know gives me great flexibilityagain with the ability to rely on theresiliency and the health checks thatare coming with the cross-cloudnetworking solution so it'll continue tohelp us accelerate in our migrations andintegration into Google cloud and givesus new ways to think about Dr and BCinstead of failing at a region level Ican probably fail to service levels Ican probably put workloads in otherplaces that would you know maybe be moreoptimal for our product stack or for ourcustomer experience so a lot of greatflexibility a lot of flexibility yeahyeah I'm looking forward to working onthis with you sowithout security nothing happens rightno no plane is left off the groundwithout securing it and and this is nodifferent right so Malaysia shared withyou a little bit of what we're doing interms of integrating natively fullyfunctional uh firewall Stacks so our ourCloud firewall is evolving to basicallybea fully uh fully featured NextGeneration firewall is actually poweredby our partners Palo Alto in the backend so it's a Palo Alto firewall that isactually plumped for you just like wePlumb your native Cloud firewall so youdon't really see it you set your policyand the policy will apply to theworkloads that are involved right sothat's the kind of cloud model that wewant for these for these firewalls andas as you look at this we're basicallybringing a ton of networks all togetherand there's perimeter firewalls at theedges of those networks right so how arewe going to do this in a practicalmanner so this is a tool that comes intoplay to actually allow you to do this ina way that is actually Cloud friendlyversus having to do a lot of PBR andstatic routes and all sorts of reallyfun stuff when you do it once but thesecond time around it you don't want todo it anymore right so so that comeswith its ownpolicy language and we extend our Cloudfirewall policy to actually allow you todo next Generation firewalling there andwe understand that you probably have abig investment in your your existingpolicy language and tooling andIntegrations and so forth so for you tobring all that over and still get thebenefits of that native Plumbing We havebasically the Network Servicesintegration manager or affectionatelyknown as nsip and nsim allows you tobasically bring bring your own firewallsthere is a series of partners thatactually participate in this program andthe firewall will be discovered all theresources in Cloud will be actuallybuilt for you and you you are left withthe things that you care about the lifecycle management of the software on yourfirewalls all the policies on yourfirewalls and the integration with yoursystems so this this is basically howwe're planning on securing all thetraffic to and from the workloads in inthe distributed app Tom what do youthink do you think this is useful foryou guys yeah definitely I mean this isgoing to be I think a pretty powerfulshift in traffic inspection and defensefor my workloadsum you know at next there's been a lotof Buzz around the ngfwum and I definitely see that it has aplace in our architectureum there are seven inspection isimportant for some of my most secureworkloads as well as the AI driventhreat intelligence that comes with aplatform like Palo Alto the URLfiltering DNS security you know manygreat options and features availablethere and to your point uh you know thisbecomes more than a workload ProtectionService you're talking about being ableto build perimeters in the cloud thatmakes sense Priceline manages a lot ofnetwork perimeters and this gives me anopportunity to consider centralizingsome of that making my life a little biteasier and more uniform as far as how doI allow things to talk to my cloud andwhat can I do toum continue to build that securityposture that makes the most sense to howwe're developing our tools you know andthen you made another great Point takingadvantage of existing tooling and theInvestments That companies have made inyou know deploying your own Palos and uhbeing able to Leverage The apis that thevendor exposes to build Automation andtooling and making you know operations alot easier is definitely critical sosimplified management reducing ourcomplexity they're all powerful storiesto to tell here fantastic soum tell me a little bit about how you doit today yeah so we've we've had somescarsum yeah so we leveraged the nativefirewall in Google and that's beenawesome allowing us to adopt microsegmentation and transform the way we doa lot of our policies but we did this wesaw that there was value in bringing anext-gen firewall to Google and deployedvirtual Palos and it's been a huge stepin our security posturewe identified the need for URL filteringand that threat analysis and mitigationthat we talked about but it didn't comewithout complexity right there's a lotto manage when you do something likethis there'srouting and multiple vendors loadbalancers lots of different pieces thatyou have to manage on top of thelifestyle life cycle of the virtualAppliance right there's firmware tomanage and patching and you know makingsure that you have all of your securitypolicies and posture and configurationlined upso looking forward to see how that getssimplified with next-gen firewall andglad to see that the Google Cloud teamhas provided a way for customers to moveforward on this in the interim fantasticwell it's a journey right so we weprotect workloads today and as we moveforward that Transit traffic will alsobe natively natively enforcedso I'm going to shift gears to theSecond Use case so we talked aboutdelivering the application on theinternet and what we're going to do forthat so now that we've built thisnetwork and it has all the bandwidththat it has you got the latency undercontrol you could see that you may haveweb applications that are in differentCloud providers or maybe on-prem andyou're probably running a dedicatedfront end for each one of these and youyou could conceivably think well what ifI brought it all under one umbrella andthat's exactly what we are opening theopportunity for you to do so the globalfront end is at its heart has the globalapplication load balancer the globalapplication load balancer is distributedworldwide and it can advertise a singleunicast IP address for your applicationout of dozens of different pops aroundthe worldthe result of that is that you can getto your application without playing anytricks on DNS Geo localizationyou have one IP address that is validacross the world and shortest pathrouting is actually going to get you tothe front end in the pop that is closestto you so we optimized that leg of theof the connection with just standardrouting mechanisms and then once you'reon the global load balancer that Globalload balancer is actually running healthchecks on all of these services not justto the different Cloud providers but tothe different regions on the differentCloud providers and on-prem Facilitiesso you have full knowledge of what thebest place is to actually serve thatapplication fromso that's the second leg optimized sonow you've got the optimal path to thebetter place to to service theapplication from and if you have staticcontent which we all do then we offloadthat to the cloud CDN that is co-locatedwith these load balancersso that optimizes your traffic the nextthing that we need is basically securityManisha talked a little bit about thisand how we have a an extensibleframework where you can actuallygrow grow your security stack andcustomize it right so the load balancersare based on Envoy proxy infrastructureand the Android proxy infrastructureallows to use service extensions and westart with Waf services and distributeddenial of service attack protection butnow you have an open environment whereyou can actually include bot protectionsand API protection sopretty powerful any thoughts on how youcould benefit from this so oh absolutelyI mean the Google Cloud load balancerand Cloud armor are critical to the waywe deliver our products to customersglad to see that the cross Cloudnetworking is integrated into this aspart of the full picture being ableagain to attach backends that are inother Cloud providers and surface themthrough a unified front end with GoogleCloud that will continue to accelerateopportunity to integrate Services whilemaintaining the benefits of the gclbright that anycast iping and theapplication routing features as well asthe layers of security enhancementsbeing able to leverage Cloud armor withits ml enhancements as well as thesystem extensions I think we'll besomething that we'll definitely want tolook intoyou knowproviding DDOS protection on-prem and inother networks can be complicated andI'm hoping that this will be a great wayto to do that with a lot less complexityso I'm sure my SRE team will love tohear about all of this they're going tohave plenty of ideas about how we canstart bringing some of this into ourproduct portfolio well we'll for sure gotalk to the sret yeahright right after this soso secure securingsecuring access from the internet superimportant but also we have all ouremployees are now basically living theinternet right so the story has changedfrom uh it's I go to work I'm on aprivate Network I go home and if I wantto do some work I have to VPN into theprivate Network so no matter what wewere keeping people on the privateNetwork that all changed and itaccelerated with covet where theinternet was the the network right andas a consequence the risk profile of ofour our employees our users basicallychanged and what the security industryhas done is basically they've enhancedthe security Stacks to include featuresthat Control Data leaks can includeother features that are relevant to theto the public access of all of theseresources and basically the the stackthat resulted is what is known as thesecure service edge stack or SSCand those Stacks have traditionally beendeployed in their own Pops in their ownlocations on on the internet reachableover the internet but they are alsoseparate from the data center so ifyou're accessing a private applicationthose tags after processing and securingeverything have to basically encrypt thetraffic and tunnel it back and there isa performance cost to that encryption inthat tunneling there's also performancecost to that detour that we take so whatwe're doing is basically bringing thosesecure Services Edge Stacks with withpartners and bringing them into Googleright some of them already run on GoogleCloud but but what's new here is thatthe traffic that comes off this securitystack is now natively in your VPC it'spart of your network so there is norequirement for encryption you'rebasically on a on a fast connectionnative in Cloudand now you can actually treat it in thesame way as you treat the nativefirewalling right so so this gives us alot of advantages in terms ofperformance of applications thatactually are accessed from the publicnetwork also for users that are in needto access SAS applications that are outon the internet we'll go through thisstack as well so now you have theflexibility to stitch based on policythe traffic through these services andwithout having to create any externalcomplicated networks and this is a keypart that I would like your uh yourthoughts Tom on what your journey hasbeen like in actually simplifying thenetwork that you had to build beforeand bringing that into a network that isConsolidated or simplified yeahdefinitely and you know as you statedthe conditions with covid and migratingto a hybrid Workforce we had to rethinkhow we were performing and providing VPNservices for our our staff right we wentthrough a major Wan consolidation overthe past year where we adoptedPrisma access as part of that solutionum because you know managing VPNhead-ins and Transit networking whilestill maintaining a high quality userexperiences obviously comes with a lotof challenges especially as thatWorkforce stretches and starts to becomeInternational so we wanted to adopt theSSE for benefits of reduction inmanaging that Hardware reduction andRoute complexity being able to leveragethe features of malware protection andURL filtering and data security as wellas being able to took all of this intoour Cloud Network fabric it made a tonof sense right so the journey that we'relooking forward to as the secureServices Edge is brought into Googlewe'll be focused on continuing tosimplify that management I can considerdropping some of that Transit networkingand simplifying that so that my sitesand my users connect directly to myprism Edge within Googleyou know that comes again with thebenefits you stated being able to droplots of ipsec tunnels so that I can takeit full advantage of the line ratespeeds and being able to deeperintegrate those Services into my cloudstack so I can surface workloads that myusers need to access every day in aagain a predictable latency experiencewith all of that bandwidth there's a lotof parts there that you know definitelymake sense as well as continuing toexpose more PSC and Google API drivenservices so that we can continue tobuild cool new features for our productsfantastic so do you think you'll missyour old Networkuhwe'll see let's see now how aboutumexperience application experience do yousee this actually improving it orhow how do you see it yeah absolutely soum you know I think this is a a goodsummary of being able to bring all ofthese cross-cloud networking Solutionstogether right so the hybrid WorkforceNow gets to benefit from the cross-clouduh interconnected Network architecturebeing able to have the performancebenefits from that the connectivity intoother clouds workload availability beingable to access the workloads I need themto wherever they might be as well asmove them around with whatever makessense in my stack with the global backend and again the global access productuh the performance benefits of thesecure Services Edge being regionallyavailable all of my distributedInternational Workforce will connect toPops that make the most sense for them Idon't have to back all traffic acrossoceans andgive you know peculiar localization uhartifacts as people are accessing thingsover the Internetum you know it'll be closer to them sothat I'll translates into a betterexperience for them as well as the richSAS pairing fabric that Google Cloudprovides right I have a lot of SASSolutions in my network architecturetoday and being able to continue toextend those benefits as a part of thatis great and then again we're talking alot about how do we make our liveseasier we've all managed Hardware we'veall managed life cycle of thoseappliances this gives us the ability tofocus on delivering features and focuson how do we continue to improveproducts instead of just managinghardware and Transit fantastic wellthank you so much Tom for all thosewonderful insights none of this wouldhappen without strong Partnerships andto tell us a little more about thosePartnerships I'm going to invite anupamand Anup to the stage so that they cantell you all about the great Palo Altoand Google Cloud partnership thank youthanksgood afternooncan you hear me yeah perfectthat was a very crisp articulation ofthe value proposition of cross lawNetworkso I'm going to inviteanupam for and thank him for being herewith us to share some of the histhoughts on our journey together sobefore that I would really like to thankPalo Altowho has been a long time customer andpartner of Google Cloudanupam we have known each other for morethan 10 years now first as friends thenas colleagues and now as partnersrepresenting two industry leadersour partnership I don't believe has beenstronger ever beforeyou heard about the cloud ngfw that welaunched as part of this partnershipdelivering 20 times the efficacy thatother similar Solutions in the markethaveas the product leader for Prisma sassywhat do you think are the synergiesbetween Google cloud and Palo Alto yeahfirst of all thank you for having me uhgreat to be here Tom great articulationof prismaccess thank you uh look Prismaaccess is Palo alto's Cloud level Sashisolution which protects all users andall applications with a consistentsecurity and policy stack all usersmeans hybrid could be remote could beBranch application could be privatepublic SAS infrastructure as a serviceand doing that with a single policy anda single security stackand what we're doing is we are providingsecurity and access without compromisingon security or access and the way thatis done is we focus on our corecompetency of just security and leverageGoogle for its hyperscaleruh the whole idea is to get the trafficwe host our service on Google Cloudwe get to Google Cloud as fast aspossible as close to the user inspectthe traffic use Google's premiumbackbone to get as close to theapplication as possibleand then egress out and what that doesis it allows us to have a securityprocessing SLE of less than 10milliseconds and that's really possibleby bringing principal access and GoogleCloud togetheris real it'sliterally about 16 months back there wasa fiber cut in Greece which caused ahuge impact it had Ripple effects fromEurope all the way to Australiaand a lot of SSC vendors that build thedata centers and fibers Bond their ownare actually an outage lasting hoursin our case our outage was less than sixseconds which means it was notperceptible to the user and that wasdone because we were leveraging Google'shyperscaler Google saw the fiber cutthey moved to a different path and therewas no impact to our Pro to our servicethat's the power of Google and Palo Altocoming together to offer this Cloudsassy solution didn't you have a Blog onthat yes I did I did absolutely and Ithink that was the time time whenreturned to office was becoming a thingAnup and I got back at Palo Alto and wewere discussing look this Cloud thing isreal like Victor was saying everythingis in the cloud people are working fromanywhere a lot of customers are usingmulti-cloud Solutionshow do we take advantage of thisinfection point multi-cloud and hybridWorkforce to provide a moredifferentiated solution for the customerdo you remember that conversationabsolutelyas you heard earlier the on-prem toCloud migration is almost behind usgen AI is changing the way our customersare thinking about innovating into thefutureapplications and data are distributedwith cross cloud dependenciescustomers are Global and the workforceis hybridby bringing two solutions like Prismaaccess and Google's Planet scale Networktogether we are able to now offer asolution that is extremely difficult toreplicate in the industrywith cross Cloud Network solution forhybrid Workforce we have a solution thatallows our customers to consolidate thebespoke networkshaveconsistent best of breed securityand enhanced application experience alltogetherbut I don't believe this is it anupam wehave to continue down this journey andif I were guessing we will bebrainstorming again for the next wave ofinnovation and I have a feeling that ithas got to do with something to do withAI and co-pilots something that your CEOnikesh is very hot on and I promise

malware and they are tryingto use all those artificial intelligenceto create new attacksand for security vendors to stay aheadwe got to understand interpret thoseattacks and provide the right protectionfor that and this is where the power ofPalo Alto security stackand the data that we get from oursecurity stack because of our points ofpresence across multiple thousands ofcustomers and Google Cloud's AIstrengths comes to play when you putboth of these together now what you cando is you use that data to reallyunderstand and that that data is justnot the data that you're coming fromyour customers the data that you alsocoming from the dark web and really usethat data to understand what are the newsecurity threats and vulnerabilitiesthat can be launched against you andbuild

so as a summary cross Cloudnetwork is here it is real and thissolution offers up to 35 percentageimproved application experience up to 40percentage lower TCO for not having tomanage your own networks that providethe cross Cloud connectivity and lastbut not the least security is built inand it is best of breedforeignNetwork you have a open platform uh withbest of breed security that is built inthat provides any to any connectivitywith high performance uh underlyingNetwork it makes the access to Google'sPremium One first party services likevertex AI spanner gke extremely simpleand efficient so
