like low doubledigits is really only online and I thinkthere's a great opportunity for us tobuild out amazing experiences forretailer again alsoTina said around different IndustriesTelco cpg Etc to to build out digitalexperiences that are amazing andstunning and so we do a course tools iswe're providing a possible Commerceplatform that gives all of our customersand retailers the opportunity to buildthese tremendous and flexible andscalable experiences and so we havecustomers like Lululemon at Tum Ulta beauty Sephora that arerequiring more from their digitalbusiness they're requiring moreflexibility they're requiring morescalability to again build these amazingexperiences and so we're providing themeffectively the the infrastructure to dothat and we're doing under the hood iseverything that we've built our entireplatform our entire capability everysort of Commerce feature that we'reoffering is natively built in GoogleCloud so we'rein Google Cloud we're built a cloudwe're a first-class citizen so there'sno compromise that we're going to do andso when we're looking at at this worldof tremendous growth and when we'relooking at the last three or four yearswe've seen a lot of course pandemicssupply chain issues and the onlyconstant remains changed and so we'rebuilding out these Commerce platformsfor our retailers and and otherbusinesses that we do business with withthat in mind to Future proof them notjust tofuture proof them but effectively tomake them future ready and so we'relooking at that flexibility andflexibility is not just the technologyit's also the organizational design thatwe're putting behind that and what thatmeans isI think previously we've been living ina world where it was always businessversus it business had an idea and itjust needed to do that and figure outhow to build it and and then there wasthis huge Clashgetting onto the road map and sort ofbuilding out the specific feature whatwe are seeing now is almost likeproductization of of teams all the wayfrom merchandising managers businessanalysts all the ways to qas and CloudEngineers so I think it's reallySynergy of of business and I.T there'sno more fighting going on it's reallyself-sustaining sort of environment andvery few silos that that remain theother notion is also and this is kind oflike the myth busting that we'reproviding is this whole notion of buildversus by I think 10 years ago we werealways sort of under the impression ifwe can't build it ourselves we have tobuy it from a vendor and usually it waslike Legacy application a monolithicapplication that we needed to buybecause guess what 10 15 20 years agowhen all of these companies were foundedor ipoed we didn't really have a cloudinfrastructure providers the way that weknow them right now so everything from afrom an architecture perspective wasbuilt very very differently and so nowwe can effectively offer both we canoffer end-to-end Commerce platformseverything from customers pricingpromotions catalogs you name it but alsowe have customers that just consume veryfew apis from us run their businessesso the way that we're looking at it isreally like a build and buy notion andyou can build everything that you seemto one the other thing is also becauseyou can pick and choose you have fasterdeployments because the teams are set upbetter you can deploy features faster wejust did a total economic impact studywith Forester and the the understandingand the insights that we've gained outof that were tremendous and one of thegold nuggets was that something thattook you for four months previously isnow only going to take you a couple ofweeks up to four weeksum so that's a 75 reduction in actuallygetting a feature by opening up a newchannel acquiring a new brand andgetting that online so it's reallyfundamentally amazing what we can dohere from an ease of use perspectivewe're also looking at a world where wewant to make everything easy tointegrate uh it was like a low code nocode kind of like interpretation themeaning there and and we want to do thatwith our ecosystem partner so we'rereally unlocking that ecosystem withoutspending a million just buildingIntegrations because just having anintegration available it doesn't reallymean that it is composable so composablereally means to us that you you havefeatures or the tenants of being Cloudnativeum and and a lot of the other thingsthat I'm going to talk aboutand again companies choose us to buildthese tremendous experiences in a moreflexible wayum but they want to do that not at thecompromise of efficienciesum or and and they want to do that atlower cost again previously you've builtand you bought these amazing Legacysituation Legacy Commerce platforms butyou effectively bought the wholethe whole gamut of features andfunctionality and they were not alwaysup to standard or best of breed thinkabout your iPhone or your Android deviceyou're probably only using 10 or 20 ofthe capabilities there that's the samenotion with these Commerce platforms youmight have a Content management systemyou might have payment integrated butdoesn't really mean that it's best ofbreed or really helping you to achieveyour your objectives there so for usit's if you would just want to use anorder API you can do so you just want touse our product catalog you can do soand so really building that out andtherefore also being at the advantage ofa lower total cost of ownershipum as as Tina mentioned we were thefounders of Mach we were pointing thisterm initially we always build out oursolution because we knew there needed tobe something better where we needed tosort of live and breathe this notion ofmicroservices first really encapsulatingbusiness capabilities our entireplatform is built in an eye Firstfashion there's no other way tocommunicate with our platform we haveover 300 apis again product catalogscustomer data promotions Etc name it andthat's the only way that you can talk toour platform and build everything thatyou wantum same notion we were built in thecloud for the cloud first class citizenin the cloud so we're entirely Cloudnative which means we can unlock theentire Google ecosystem whether you talkabout Vision apis Google bigquery uhpreviously you had to like downloadexport and upload again to like do somelittle crunching you don't have to dothat anymore because all the productslive in the cloud in the Google Cloudand sofinal H here is headless really meaningthe the separation of front and thenback end and that's again what we'vepioneered because everything that yousort of initially understood of retailto be was just like the website rightthat's how everything started out to beyou're going into the typical experiencelooking atumI don't know looking at a a Retailer'swebsite you're looking at the productcategory page product detail page youyou sort of went to the checkout and youchecked out the card and so I thinkthat's the typicalmotion or customer Journey that we'vebeen used to I think what really changesthe underlying capability because we'rea cloud native in that aspect and againbecause we're headless the head can beanything it could be a device it couldbe a kiosk in a McDonald's when you goin and order it could be a magic mirrorthat you use with AI and VR it could beanything you you want to beand effectively you're just calling anAPIum I'm going to speed up a littlebecause the last of youum valuable minutes at the beginningwhat it comes down to under the hoodit's we're so much faster three timesfaster with deployments with migrationsjust because we're uh we're leveragingeverything that's built in the cloud wecan come to a positive RI much muchfaster five times in about three yearsand much much lower total cost ofownership and it wouldn't be um a Googlenext sort of presentation without afancy architecture diagram so I sort ofembedded this just to understand or orhelp understand how we're build and setup I think the keynote or the key pointsto take away here is really the notionthat everything that we have lives inGoogle so we're talking about productswe're talking about customer data we'retalking about card data we're talkingabout order data everything can besurfaced and accessed through the apisthat we're providingand and that makes it really reallypowerful even from a from a workflowperspective right just a very simpleexampleumthe way that we are saving and storingdata everything is embedded Google Cloudso no sort of media libraries that arehosted somewhere else or on-prem or nearErp everything sits in Google everythingcan be accessed changed inquiredum so if you get a customer requestevery every bit of data sits in GoogleCloud that can and therefore be actionuh even if there's like seasonality orPeaks Etc everything can be loadbalanced using the like native GoogleCloud functionality and so if a customerrequests like is this is this itemavailable is this item available in mystore is the store available to send itto me out of store or does it need to besent out of a distribution center or awarehouse all of this data is availableand can be accessed and then obviouslyfrom a resolution perspectiveonly when certain criterias and thebusiness logic checks out that's when acustomer will get their their inventorythat they were looking forand I just wannacall out sort of two customers that wehave that have been tremendous Partnersnot only for us but a Google perspectivebeing out of beauty and an LLB and Ithink the customer example here isreally arounduhum a story where Ulta beauty I meanthey're doing about five billion dollarsin Revenue one billion of that is inonline onlythey're having about1100 stores across all 50 states and sowe're we're helping them to really boosttheir their business their digitalbusiness we're helping them really tellthat omni-channel story because as youcan imagine they have so many differentproducts so many different categories somany different brands that they carryand we're helping them make sense of allof that and again with the help ofGoogle Cloud as well and so it's it'sreally important for us that we'rehelping thembe more flexible be more scalable orwhatever the seasonality is it's nolonger Black Friday Cyber Monday we havea Telco customer that makes more moneyin the day when the new iPhone orAndroid devices are being launched thanactually on Black Friday Cyber Monday sowhat is that seasonalityand that we can help themum act on same with LLB and I think theycome from athey come very sort of traditional it'slike catalog-based business modelum they were really focused on in-storeexperiences again we are helping themnot only in store but we're also helpingthem with their online channels they'vealready embarked this notion of aheadless customer Journey uh before theyeven talked to us it was a great exampleof traditional retailer being open forkind of like unlocking their businessfor freedom to experiment and then doingnew things and I think Commerce toolsjust gave them that extra Edge to reallytransact on that and and so we're reallycombining the different experiencesphysical stores and the onlineexperiences but then again because we'reheadless we can do so much more we cando client telling can help the storeassociates so all of that can just beaccessed with the apis that we have atour disposal and effectively help LLBand other Beauty and Sephora and othercustomers really Excel with with theirbusiness[Music]digital experience and that has to dowith data and information silos so Ithink data Silo is not only betweensystems and between teams as well cancause friction for customers acrossliterally any industrythings that we all encountered a brickwall when dealing with customer supportonline or when experiences differ verydrastically across platforms and modesSocrates can you discuss how Quantummetric is helping Enterprises tacklethis challengecan you guys hear meokay so I'm going to first introduce youto Quantum metricuh soyeah I have to first figure out how thisworks okay so what I want you to knowabout Quantum metric is two thingsnumber onethe largest bankthe largest Airlines the largestretailers the largest Telecom providersthe largest Healthcare companies gamingcompaniesall use quantum metric to deliverdelightful customer experiences in theirapplicationsthe number two unique point I want youto remember isthat each of these customers who uses usyou will see that delivering digitalexperiences not just one person's job Iam the chief paragraph officer atQuantum but it's just not my job todeliver best experiences I need myengineering counterpart I need mymarketing teams I need my customersuccess teams it takes a village todeliver that and and that's what you seeover here that like a very bigdistribution of teams and how we getusedso what are all theseokay so what are all these customersusing Quantum metric for so imagine youbuilt an app you built an app forsomeone like either an employee or acustomer and you build them up becauseyou want them to get some stuff donesome tasks completed what does the tasklook like for a bank it could bedepositing depositing a checkat an Airlines it could be making areservation or changing your seat at ane-commerce company it could be buying apurchase or returning somethingat a Healthcare Company it could befinding a doctor or an appointmentand any time when you are deliveringthese digital experiences and yourcustomers run into problems we help themidentify why they're getting stuck whythey cannot get those tasks doneand we don't just stop by just tellingyou that these are the friction pointsbecause like look all of us get fiveescalations a day over herethe question is how do I prioritize andunderstand why this friction point ishappening and what we end up doing isnot only we identify the friction beQuantified for you and Associate abusiness value with you that these manyusers are impacted this much revenue isimpacted these many calls are happeningto call center in a variety of ways andhowever you're tracking a businessmetricand the reason we are able to do that isbecause of our roots are in sessionand for those who are not familiar withsession replay like you have watchedSteph Curry takes a jump shot you canwatch a replay of itthe similar thing in the digital worldwell if a user is using your app websitehe asked he can replay how that user usethat particular applicationand because we have all of this datathis data across all userswe can activate that data show you thefriction points and then quantify themfor youokayso let's get into it and I want to tellthe story from the lens of Home Depotjust to show our fans how many of youdid remodeling during the cover timeI see a lot of hands raised up so whileI was doing remodeling I was using HomeDepot and look we think digital issimple but digital is inherently complexand the complexity is growing year overhere and I want to tell that story tothe lens of Home DepotI have bought on Home Depot on their appwebsiteI've picked up in store I've had thingsdelivered to my house changed things inbetween I've used everything so acustomer like me is expecting Home Depotto deliver an omni Channel experienceand a seamless experience that I shouldbe able to do whateverand then one of the things that we didwas we started mapping out for allretailers Like Home Depotwhat does digital look like what is itthat they care about what experiencesare they deliveringand by no means I'm saying this is acomplete test but these are kind of jobsto be done for a modern retailerwe counted at least 60 of themand think about the challenge of digitalthat these 60 experiencesyou have to deliver on webyour native applications sometimes kioskas wellif you are the person who's managingthisthe question you should be asking ishow do I stay on top of all of thesedigital experiences that they arealreadyand I can tell you there's not enoughtime on the daya budget in a company that you can hireenough people spend enough time to stayon top of all of these thingsand and this is the and when we went andtalked to customers like Home Depot thefeedback which we got from them was canyou help me build a product which helpsme get started fasterhelp find insights fasterandraise the bar on my teamwe came up with this product this islive right now we launched it earlierthis year called Atlasso for each of these micro experienceswhich I talked to you about and in thiscase you're talking about checkoutfunnelat the very top I'll tell you out of thebox what are the kpis you should careaboutand how you should monitor them whatquestions you should be asking whenthings go wrong so that this becomes areally good assistto your digital team as the debugproblems they stay on top of problemsone way I think about it right now thatthis is what I would think about a Do-itor a co-pilot before all this Jai camein because this is a really goodadditional assistfor anybody who's managing the checkoutfunnelso well guys like these and this is whatwe call as a guide so we built guideslike these for all the 60 use cases inretail which we showedbut we didn't stop therewe did it for all the verticals we arein today that if you are using Quantumand if you're using Atlas I can get youstarted in analysis and in making anddeliveringbetter experiences for your customersright nowcan you still hear mehelloall right I think we're going to move toa quick discussionwith our two guests Karthik and Michaelhere can folks hear me noI'm so sorryyes oh amazing it works okay all rightso we're going to move to a quickdiscussion with our two guests kartikand Michael here so as you've probablyseen in the keynote with Thomas andSundar this morning it's all about Aiand generative Ai and as we know uh withAI and general AI coming more to thethat makes breaking down data silos evenmore imperative just with the scale andvolume of data coming in so onover to Michael First In your experiencewith your customers what really isneeded to break down silos so thatcompanies can realize the vision of AIso I think at Commerce tools we have avery pragmatic approach when it comes togenerative AI we think of ourselves asthe the underlying infrastructure thatreally Powers the Commerce enginewhen I think about generative Ai and thefirst applications that we've seen it'sall around product recommendationsreviews things of that nature almostlike 10 15 years ago where Big Data camefirst into play and I think it's thequestion is really around data and Ithink we really want to dissect what isfat and everybody jumping on the Gen AITrend versus what is an actualapplication right now we think a lot ofapplication is in the promotion engine alot of application is in the contentengine none of which we dowhat we want to do at Commerce tools iswe want to look at ways on making ourplatform better for the operationalusers the backends the developers theengineers we want to introduce a lowcode no code kind of like environmentwhere we can helpour users our customers to really usegen AI we actually want to use gen AI tobuild Integrations for us so if you wantto use a Marketplace offering if youwant to use a Content management systemif you want to use a search engine wewant to tell gen Ai and prompt it andsay build this integration for me rightthat's what that's where we see the biggame changer for usbecause we are the transactional enginethere's very few decisions that arehappening on our side we effectively arejust order takers but we're amazing atthat so when we're talking about gen AIin the context of content we want thecontent management system to take overif we are talking about it in a searchcontext we want Google we want algoliawe want Constructor to take over rightlike really build that AI in thoseapplications and that's what we reallymean with composable I think there's alot of myths that needs to be bustedaround composable and I think we want tofocus on what we do really really wellwhich is the actual transactional engineorchestrating everything under the hoodbut we really think as you build outthese best of breed applications theyshould own their part and then the sumof its part effectively builds that thatamazing and tremendous uh sort ofbusiness experience and I think that'swhy we want to take a pragmatic approachabout it that's why we're very much Techfocused on that and we have a hugeecosystem that builds in that umlike the Gen AI aspect uh from a from apartner perspectiveI love your point of view on this aswellsolook I'll go back to our first slide interms of how many different teams areusing usand already today in the quantum productitself they can collaborate across salesand marketing and all these other placesand that's because we can identifyfriction and we can tie to a businessvalue and now because it's right you canprioritize it you can align teams on itand it helps breaks like data silos in abig way now when I take it one stepfurther and I go to atlasone of the things which I've heard overand over again and as we have gone andspoken with customers on generative AIisyou need a data Foundation to go togeneration Ai and what Atlas does islike one of those data foundations foryou that it tells you what are themetrics to matter matter for each ofthose experiences what you should betracking it tracks all of those thingsout of the box and breaks it down likehow it like by different dimensions likeplatforms geographies so on and so forthso now you have a very good dataFoundation to build upon and and you canrun with itforeign but then I also want to talkabout one of the assets which we havewhich we don't talk about much which isthe session replayso if you used a session I have theentirety of that session to see how youinteracted with that application andtoday I think we are probably activatingone percent of the dataso imagine with the help of vertex AI ifwe if we can light up more of that datamaybe 30 40 50 percentand we can still quantify all of thosethings how easy we can make things forour customers and I wanted to tell thatstoryfrom the lens of this flywheel over hereso today at Quantum we get data from webwe get data from mobile both mobile weband Native apps we also get data fromconnected devices like kiosks so likeall of this data is coming inthe first task iscreating events out of the data so thatI can make sense of that data so I cantrain vertex AI to understand HTML andCSS and say like this is an add to cartbutton and this is the value of the addto cartI can train vertex to understand thatthis is what an error looks likeand not only that vertex can find thaterror in multiple languages you alreadysaw in uh TK's keynote today that likevertex supports like about 140 oddlanguages so I can automatically tag thedata and activate for youthenI can process the data and make itmeaningful for you and lots of differentways so the two ways which we have beenexperimenting at our end is one iscalled session summarization that I cantake the entire session replayand I can summarize it so imagine youcall a contact center and Tina I'mspeaking with Tina and I tell Tina heyTina were you trying to order an iPhonerose gold color and you're running intocheckout issues and Tina says yeswe can resolve a problem faster withempathyand all of that is done because I canprovide that agent with a sessionsummarization which llm like vertex cangenerate like really really easilynext up is once I've processed andlighted up all of this data how do Iactivate this data so we have talkedabout I can think about activation intwo forms one is offline analysis oranalytics as we think about like wheremy users coming and going and anddropping frombut I can also use them for real-timecustomer rescue and real-time customerActivation so for example with one ofour customers there are a lot of accessinventory and they said that when I seethis inventory in somebody's shoppingcartand you see that customers struggle canyou throw in a pop-up give them a couponcode or a fast code to call a contactcenter so they can get their purchasedone we did that based upon that signaland they drove like 40 plus conversionsduring those promotion timesnow that signal can come in a verydefinitive way through gen Ai and vertexso this is now all of this is generatingmore data which we capture and this ishow I would describe a flywheel whichbenefits all different teamsthank you Karthikum and next um I would love to inviteour speakers to present the top one totwo with key takeaways they would likethe audience to take away withum when it comes to leveraging the bestof open data Cloud solutions to helpEnterprises continually deliver uponthat seamless digital experience soMichaelsure thank youum I think a couple of two key takeawaysnumber one is I thinkin light of the the question that wejust sort of answered I think the notionof composable the notion that we'reworking with an API first application Ithink that is the best foundation forgenerative AI because if that data isavailable in one locationum sitting in Google Cloud it can beused in the entire ecosystem so not justthe Google Cloud ecosystem not just theCommerce tools ecosystem everyindependent software vendor that we'reconnecting withhas access to that data and therefore Ithink it would be amazing if whetherit's Jasper or chatgpt when you can justprompt Commerce tools and we're buildingthese connections for for chat GPT andJasper where we can prompt it and giveus that information in terms ofinventory product availability productdata and in general so I thinkthe the key takeaway from from me hereisthat composable and API first is theamazing and best foundation for anythingAI or gen AI for the future that's onestatement and and that's wherePartnerships like with Quantum andGoogle come in like super super handybecause they can take that dataavailableanother big thing iswhen we look at our customers and howthey get started managing data is thefirst step in their digitaltransformation because a lot of themstruggle with the data model and thedata Concepts from their legacy vendorsand so the first thing that they'redoing is they're cleaning up their datathey're looking at their data model andwe have a super flexible data model tomake that available if you skip thatfirst step whether you use Big Data genAI or any sort of big memory kind oflike play you just have data fasterand it doesn't actually help you inmaking decisions driving customerexperience Etc so figuring out what thatdata looks like and how it can bemassaged and crafted and is availableit's sort of my key takeawayand then I think for for you specificbusinesses I think the third and finalkey takeaway for me ismake sure that you're not jumping on afad and just because everybody's talkingabout gen AI that you want to apply thatand use it I think building out a teamto even look at generative AI is also amistake in and of itself because itFosters more silos so I think Gene AIshould beum a method a practice it should be partof your DNA it should be part of each ofyour teams and how you look at that itshouldn't be a department in yourInnovation group or strategy group orsomething and so I think be pragmaticabout it how and where you want to useit and then find applications that aremeaningful to you and I think those aremy three key takeawaysthank you Nick any more key takeawaysso2 over here and both of them come fromcustomer conversations so our customersare so the first takeaway is customerwants products and solutionswhich are outcome first and not featurefirst right yes thousand people canbuild funnels look at Journeys but to dowhat to understand a checkout funnel tounderstand like can I change a flight orwhy your users might be dropping from achange flight or why people while makinga transfer on a bank cannot make atransfer and my call volumes are goingup in the contact center because what wefail to understand is our customers haveto take those features and Stitch ittogether at their end to deliver thatsolution and that is time consumingthey often do not have the time or theresources to get that things done solikeI would urge all products to be likeoutcome firstor a feature firstthe second is we we talked a lot aboutcollaborationand and I want to hit on thatcollaboration Point again but from twoangles first is internal collaborationthat look any product which creates moresilos is not a great product because ourcustomers are asking us all of us andwhen I say us I meaneverybody who is supporting thatcustomerthat can you enable collaborationsbetween my marketing team and my productteam my product team and engineeringteam and so on and so forth so internalcollaboration but I would go one stepfrom there and and Michael hinted tothat it's like look they're usingQuantum but they're also using Commercetools they're also using algolia orBloom reach or other companies overthere so the collaboration also comesfrom taking this data from differentsources being able to join them and drawinsights from all of thatand with that in mind I think one of thethings that we have been able to do withthis Google partnership and thispartnership on style cells iswe are launching an isv Commerce Networkuh which is with Google's help so Googlehas their Quantum metric is theirCommerce tool is their kin and Carterand Bloom read are there so that liketogether when we join forces and we havemore solution focused we can help ourcustomers move the wall much faster muchfurtherthank youso I thinkI thinkumif anyone has any questions contactMichael and I will be off to the sideafter the session's overum so for anyone interested in learningmore about tools and Quantum metricSolutions are on the Google CloudMarketplace so I invite you to scan theQR codes and learn more about thesolutionsand finally the team that Karthik justmentioned Ken and Carter Commerce toolsBloom rage and Quantum metric we're allhosting an intelligent experiences afterdark happy hour at the canopy at theHilton tonight so welcome you again toscan the QR code RSVP and join us overthereall right feedback is greatlyappreciated I know we have sometechnical difficulties so feel free tofill in the survey on the app as wellthank you very much"
