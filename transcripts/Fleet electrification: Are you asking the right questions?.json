attention but uh thanks somuch for being here everyone my name isDenise Pearl I'm part of the ecosystemand channels organization of Googlecloud and I manage a program calledGoogle cloud ready sustainability soduring the show you guys may have heardabout other designations within ourpartner program Google cloud readybigquery Google cloud ready SovereignCloud these are specific designationsthat we award to partners with domain orsubject matter expertise in order tohelp our customers basically isolate theright partners for the right problem andso I'm here today joined by Mike andShane and I'm going to allow them tointroduce themselves and Shane I mightgo to you first because just want topoint out that Deloitte is the firstGlobal Systems integrator that's joinedthe Google cloud ready sustainabilityprogram so I'm super thrilled to be herewith you today thank you I want to tellthem what you're up to absolutely so Iguess it's still good morning dependingon the time zone good afternoon ShaneMulder Shane moldenhauer I'm a partnerin Deloitte Canada I lead oursustainability and climate uh practicespecifically focused on transportationdecarbonization and I lead our assetFactory in a sense for buildingtechnologies that apply to our specificclient needs and one of those largestneeds is Fleet electrificationspecifically so really interested to getinto that conversation a little bit moreand share on what we've been doingwonderful and Mike you want to telleverybody who you are and what you doabsolutely my name is Mike Branch I headupdate in analytics an AI at geotab soI've been doing that for the last sixand a half almost seven yearsum and just very quickly geotab we weprocess data from about you know 3.7million connected commercial vehiclesacross the globe so we're looking atabout 50 billion records coming in uh ona daily basis across the whole ecosystemso I'm really excited to work veryclosely with the folks at Google andDeloitte towards Fleet electrificationon my team I've got a number of dataanalysts data scientists and Engineersproduct folks all looking at we you knowmy whole mantras it takes a villagereally to raise any data and AI productsso that kind of falls under my umbrellaat geotep wonderful so what we wanted toshare with you guys today is somethingthat we're talking about inside myprogram something called ambition loopsand the idea is that customers startedcoming to I think collectively all of usabout two years ago with a reallyfocused conversation on sustainabilitythey wanted to do something in regardsto sustainability in their organizationbut I think they were all asking uswhere do we start what do we do and soagain we created this program insideGoogle Cloud Google cloud readysustainability and it is this showcasemoment to Spotlight these Solutionsthese industry value networks that havecome together technology systemsintegration Cloud infrastructure inorder to specifically address aparticular sustainability businessproblem within our mutual customers andthe one that we worked on together withgeotab and Deloitte is around Fleetelectrification we heard prettyconsistently from a lot of our mutualcustomers that one of the things theythought they could quickly do wasElectrify their Fleet and change thesustainability position within theirorganization and so we wanted to cometogether today tell you a little bitabout that story and maybe give you afew moments of introspection about thisjourney Lessons Learned and things youcan can consider right moving forward soMike I said like you know a couple yearsago these people are coming to usthey're like hey I've been doingtelematics now I want to think aboutsustainability the CEOs and CEOs andCFOs were starting to join these Fleetconversations and telling us like youknow the boards are asking us to dosomething about our business in thesustainability area how can how can wedo that with our Fleet we we've heardthis thing about electrification so whatwere you hearing is it pretty similaryeah a lot of the whys behind it there'sa number of reasons rightum so there's uh a number of governmentincentives that exists today right to beable to move your Fleet from IceVehicles electric vehicles so thattypically is is a big incentive forthese fleets to kind of move thingsforward increasingly you havesustainability as a mandate across theboard right we're seeing Chiefsustainability officers being more andmore concerned about how they can drivetheir prerogatives throughum and one of the interesting things isif you look at where emissions aregenerated from from you know buildingsfrom industry from vehiclesthe the commercial fleets across theglobe stand such they can make such abig impact that's rightum a third of uh you know Transportationmissions come from commercial fleetsand so unlike you or I you know Ichanged my vehicle maybe once every fivemaybe ten years right uh these and somepeople don't even have them anymorethese fleets are changing their vehiclessometimes on an annual basis and there'sa cycle right so as you're trying tomake that decision of you know which newvehicles you're going to purchase let'smake them sustainable let's see how youcan move towards electric vehicles so ifyou look at the ability to actuallyimpact change from a statementsustainability perspective wow what animpact you have with with commercialfleets so there's kind of tax incentivesthe government incentives there's thatsustainability approach but there's alsofrom an operations perspective you standa chance to be that much more productiveas an organization right we're seeing uheven zero emission zones start to comeacross uh the the globe where in thefuture you're going to have to have oneof these EVs and so you need to startright now and figure out how you canmake these changes so these are some ofthe reasons why we're seeing folkstrying to look towards you know how canI take my fleet right now and movetoward toward EV yeah I think that Shanelike when what Mike was just describingyou've got you know these companies thathave these corporate fleets and they'restarting to think about electrificationbut that decision is is sointerconnected with the societies andwhere in which we operate right like Ican't just decide to overnight Electrifyunless I've addressed EV charginginfrastructure or thought about like yousaid tax incentives how am I actuallygoing to do all of these things and Iknow that this is an area thatdeloitte's been Keen to help our mutualcustomers actually lay out that overallthought leadership and plan obviouslybringing in key technology but I thinkit's it's a bit more than that so if youwant to talk about what you guys havebeen doing in electrified Fleet yeah forsure so if we look at our typicalcustomers I say that be in threedifferent points of maturity along thecurve on their electrification Journeythere are those that haven't started atall there are those that have kind ofdipped their toes in trying to figureout what to do they bought one tokenelectric vehicle and they've parked itin the garage for two three years Ihaven't touched it since because youknow they don't know how to use it andthen there's the other side of it whichis we're really committed we've done itwe've got vehicles in our Fleet we'vegot charging infrastructure in place andthat's exactly kind of where Deloittesteps in is because we have all theseclients at different maturity levelscoming to us and asking us specificallywe need helpalong the path either they started ornot and so we built a tool setleveraging fantastic data that we getfrom geotab in our alliance with geotaband leveraging the power of the gcpplatform to build a tool set calledelectrified Fleet that tool set has beenfundamental in bringing together verydisparate sets of data but also creatinga source of Truth which really has beenthe significant key piece for helpingthem feel comfortable with what we'rerecommending is actuallyyou know they can apply it in practiceand it's sort of I I mean I hate to sayit but auditable right verifiable Ithink that's such a key component partof the Google cloud ready designateNation as you both know having gonethrough it it's this validation that thetechnology that there's domain expertisesubject matter expertise in some casesclimate science backing it and that thethe raw data informing this or the youknow transform data that will help thesecompanies make these decisions is againpacked and and sort of uh verified so wereally appreciate the work that you'redoing thereum I I think just for everybody in theaudience to understand I don't thinkthat the telematics data alone is what'sgoing to get us you know to fullelectrification right Mike I mean whenwe started helping people like you saidyou can't Electrify the entire fleetovernight right so you were saying thatsome people start they often start witha telematics questionum I'm just kind of curious like we'veobviously been in meetings where peoplemaybe have deployed geotab already butsome of them have not like what do youtell customers that don't even have thetelematics data to inform it or they'vegot other types of telematics data howdo you get them going yeah you knowoftentimes we always say like ourmantras you you can't manage where youdon't measure so you have to absolutelystart and and one of the things is likeit's it's nice to show studies of whatother fleets have done but the only trueway that you can know how to transformyour own sleep is by starting withtelematics right and so uh I I think byinstalling you know it might be in a POCright you start with a geotab devicecombined with you know deloitte'selectrified solution it takes both thedata and the interpretation of that datato actually transform your Fleet andwhat we find is that by understandinghow your Fleet moves and what becauseeach Fleet is different right you've gotfleets in the government space you'vegot heavy duty fleece light dutycommercial fleets they all operatedifferently and you want to know what'sthe potential for not justdid that archetype of a fleet totransform but your Fleet you'respecifically so by having these deviceson your fleet vehicles monitoring howyou're moving you know how often you'reidling how often you're going ondifferent grades it's so crucial I meanit really does start with the dataum and and as we've been looking atpulling in all of this datait's not just enough to say that youknow I'm capturing speed right or I'mcapturing you know RPM or I'm capturingstate of charge well what at whatfrequency at what Fidelity all of thesethings matter because you have to builda solid foundation of data quality to beable to do something that's right rightI mean weum we have our electric vehiclesuitability assessment right uh whichDeloitte leverages as a toolum in electrified and what we what we dowith that is we look at what is thesuitability of the vehicles within yourFleet to actually move toward electricvehicles taking into account a wholeslew of things the temperature the gradeof the road right the types of vehiclesbecause not every vehicle can beelectrified at this point but one of thethings that's really exciting to me isthat you know you look uh pre-pandemicmaybe around 20 or during the beginningof the pandemic 2020 2021 we did a studywith Enterprise Fleet Management rightand it was this this Mass ElectricVehicle suitability assessment so welooked across their entire fleet of youknow over a hundred thousand Vehicles wesaid you know what what is thecapability for us to Electrify basicallyand at that point in time was about 13of the fleet could actually move to uhto EVS that was due to the EVavailability a whole bunch now so muchhas happened since then that we ran itagain this year 45 right so therethere's such a an ability for thesefleets to start moving towardselectrification and we're going to seemore and more of that happening with thetotal cost of ownership coming down forthese vehicles but you know to yourpointthe data is certainly one point thequality of the data but then it's theinterpretation and that's why workingwith folks like Deloitte to help ourcustomers through that whole transitionphase is so important yeah I thinkI'd love to give some metrics becauseyou I I remember that story and I thinkI just watched your CEO present at thesupply chain just to double click onthis because often we get askedquestions about like how do we invest inthese projects and I think that what youguys demonstrated even with 13 of thatFleet there was something like a 30million dollar operational savingswithin that org over four years so I Ithink that there is sort of thisperception that investing insustainability is somehow you know notprofitable for organizations and I thinkwhat we're seeing is thisinterconnection absolutely betweensustainability and operationalefficiency but I I think Shane you knowone of the the things that always popsinto my mind when Mike tells thesestories is like I said we in order tomake these electrification decisions itis the vehicle it's in some cases theload the type of vehicle the driverBehavior the temperature it's also thiscommunity like charging infrastructureand like how do we I mean that's reallya big part I think of how it's extendinginside Deloitte you're not just thinkingabout electrified Fleet but you'rethinking about grids and things likethat do you want more Cooks in thekitchen exactly you want to share alittle bit more detail it is a bigdecision it's a big interconnecteddecision I think to make that happenyeah it's a little bit more of a complexquestion so a typical Fleet transitionis my vehicles are aging out or I'mexpanding my business procurement goesout and buys Vehicles Whoever has thevehicle that's the right size and that'spretty much the consideration does it dowhat I needed to do from a loadperspective or a people carrierperspective and so now you have asituation where you have a client sayingI want to ElectrifyFleet procurement goes out and sayswanna buy EVS it's not that easy rightthere are so many different types ofvehicles you have to consider thingslike range but also battery chemistryyou have to consider the operationaltemperature for where you want tooperate those vehicles and then thecharging infrastructure which oftenseems to be the downfall of a lot oflarge corporate customers that want todo it is because the public charginginfrastructure doesn't exist to actuallyrun that Fleet so now you have to kindof roll backwards and consider well myfacilities management group might havesome ideas around what our actualkilowatt usage is at a specific locationso if I go to them and say I want toinstall you know 10 DC fast chargersthey might turn around and say that'llkill the entire plant's usage so youhave to bring in more people into theconversation than you usually would andthen you have you know you've got atop-down approach as well happeningwhere the board is setting goals sayingwe need to do X Y and Z in terms ofsustainability what does that translateto in the fleet side and often theresponse is well we don't reallynecessarily know we know how much fuelis spent and we know our vehicles travelthis far per year that's that's aboutthe metrics that they often have andit's definitely not something that theycan then huge and turn around and sayyou know 45 or a fleet is going to betransitioned yeah I think what the thereal way that this comes together in mymind is just thinking about the userJourney the day in the life because Ithink sometimes these conversations arehappening with it from a Google Cloudperspective we're talking to GoogleCloud users and you're logging into theGoogle Cloud console where none of thisdata exists right but in some casesyou're very familiar with bigquery whichis where a lot of your events go I knowyou're connecting into bigquery as wellfor the data aggregation lots of bqgisfunctionality happening there everythinghappens somewhere so a lot of thelocation stuff happening within bigquerywhich we're very grateful for and thenof course you guys for the most partgeotab for a lot of years has beenspeaking to the fleet managers right andso but like Shane's talking about whenyou start talking about procurementboard level decisions Etc we reallyneeded that election certified fleetlayer that dashboard where differentteams can interact with the data nothave to be an expert in bigquery or inFleet Management so it's I I just Iwould love for you to talk a little bitmore Shane about like what what the userexperience is when they log intoelectrified Fleet like what kind ofthings what different types of userswould be connecting there and what typesof decisions can they make well actuallywhat I'll do is I'll tell you a bitabout a client story that we havebecause it'll kind of translate this orgive people a connection point to it wehave a really large customers of ourspure later in Canada it's a last miledelivery company they are a long-termgeotab customer and have had you knowtelematics in their Fleet for thelongest time they had a board leveldecision made that they had to reducetheir gear nascarian missions I think itwas like 60 percent or that they had toreduce no sorry 40 that reduce theirFleet for their or for the leader forthe entire organizationwhich on paper translated to 60 of theirFleet had to be switched to electricvehicles so now you have I think it'salmost 5 000 vehicles that have to bechangedor considered to be changed to electricvehiclesstep one is which vehicles should Iconsider which could even because theseare not your typical passenger car theiryou know class two Vans class three vansum and the supply chain is reallyconstrained the charging requirementsfor these are very difficult topassenger vehicle so they came to thelight and asked Can you guys support uson our journey we know that you have atool set available to do exactly that sowe went in and did a full evaluation ofall other fleets so we looked at asix-month period of data including theambient temperature so we did a bit of aseason fromum kind ofwinter into spring so we could see thetemperature variances for the entireoperations across all the countryand it was really interesting to seebecause the initial ninja reaction whenwe gave them the data was well theselocations make sense let's do it butthen when we brought the facilities teamin they said well all of these areactually old buildings they don't havethe ability to do that so now we have tostart planning into our facilities teamso you haveelectrified Fleet is broken into fourdifferent personas you have your Fleetyour Fleet operations and Fleetprocurement core people you have yoursustainability people that consider whatare the impacts and which kind ofvehicles would have what impact acrossyour greenhouse gas emissions reductionand then you have your business side soyour financial planning because one ofthe outputs is a seven year procurementplan so which charges do I need to buyexactly by when and how do I kind ofspace that out with procurement ofvehicles because some of the DC fastcharges the lead time is eight monthsbut some of these commercial vehiclesthe lead time is 12 months so you almosthave to buy the vehicles and then theinfrastructure but neither arrive for avery long time and so it's beeninteresting and then the last one is isthe pure Facilities Management sidethese are the sites we've identifiedthis is how many Chargers and then theykind of give us inputs around this isour current capacity constraint for thislocation what can you do with thatcharging infrastructure and then how canwe put the vehicles into them as well soit's multiple different personas thatproject was a huge success we supportedthem in identifying exactly how manyvehicles to transition and we're happyto say that they're going to be removingabout 80 000 tons of greenhouse gasesfrom their Fleet over the next few yearsso that's uhvery nice it's a great story yeahbecause it tells it it's exactly what wehave seen from all of our customers it'slike we haven't I we have a board leveldecision we have a fleet that doesn'tnecessarily know where to start theyknew what they needed to do they alreadyacquired some Vehicles they were testingit pure later is very Progressive aroundtheir green strategy and but they stillneeded that support on like how do I howdo I do this by 2030 because they haveAmbitions to be completely Net Zero by2050. that's right yeah it isinteresting because we we see these likepublic commitments about Net Zero transyou know transition and I think theseboard members feel obligated or c-levelexecutive feel obligated the consumersthe customers are asking for it but thenwhen you go back down into the org andtry to understand all of the data that'srequired to actually get you to Net Zerooftentimes in Old traditional ways ofaggregating data or viewing data the oldsheets way of doing everything what youfind out is by the time I could view allthe data that I need I've already missedmy 2030 goal so I think you know usingthe power of cloud to aggregate all ofthat data you mentioned both of you havesaid about weather yeah and it's beeninteresting to me in the program that Isupport just how often people ask forweather because it's such an incredibleimpact on some of these decisions thatwe make you know both like theefficiencies of vehicles and then thecharging infrastructure itself so yeahMike I think one thing that I'd love todouble click on with the fleet managersif there's any of them in the audienceare watching right because these are thepeople that you've been coaching upShane just mentioned all of these otherexternal people that are going to becalling them for help what would yousuggest us that they think about as theystart to grow and update theirtelematics infrastructure their FleetManagement Solutions yeah no I thinkagain the the focus on on data qualityis so important andum you know at geotab we haveum we're connected to uh we have we haveEngineers who are consistently reverseengineering getting the right signalsfrom the EVS that exist out there wehave new EVS being introduced into themarket uh every single day right and soum for for data quality to be reallygood you have to be able to extractthese signals whether that come from thevehicle itself or from an oem Cloud toCloud connection so as you're thinkingabout that that transition to EV tosustainable I think very very carefullyabout not just whether you're getting asignal what Fidelity what is the shapeof that so how good is the data qualitythat you're getting from the vehiclethat is so so so Paramount rightum and then yeah we leverage a ton ofGoogle Cloud to be able to process thisdata at scale right you think about thedata coming in from the vehicles rightGPS data at scale marrying that andsnapping it to the right roads to makesure that you can understand the gradepulling in temperature data as well tooright so we've got the ambienttemperature coming in from you know 3.7million commercial vehicles so we havehyper local temperature and weatherlocation but you're snapping that all tothis road Network so we leverage youknow Google bigquery bqgis and all thisstuff and pull that all together I thinkbqml as well bqml as well too yeahum but yeah the whole stack is reallybuilt on on gcp Kafka kubernetes to pumpeverything into that big query platformand then really excited about a lot ofthe work being done now on vertex Ai andand how we're taking that to the nextstep in leveraging gender Beyond yeahthere were these questions I thinkcoming up you know we start to thinkabout gen AI the ability to actuallyinspect this type of telematics data andask questions like which one of myvehicles are you know the largestproducers of carbon emissions or thingslike that and then you can sort of againI think one of the things to take awayfrom this value network of the peoplesitting on the stage here is again youknow directly being a BQ consumerhearing things like bqgis and bqml someof these terms I think for Fleet peoplecould seem a little abstract so it's sowonderful to have a company like geotabthat's just built on top of it producethis my geotab layer so you can actuallyjust see the things you need to seeright and you don't have to benecessarily an infrastructure and thepartnership that's why I think thepartner that's these industry valuenetworks the partnership amongst thethree here has been what's allowed us toaccelerate right think any one componentwouldn't have allowed pure later toachieve that that dream right absolutelybut you have all three componentstogether in that valueso I I'd love to just kind of and wewant to save some time for questionsfrom the audience but I would love toask you both like um again maybe uh ifyou were to give one two one or twopieces of guidance Mike or just lessonslearned from your point of view I thinkum don't be afraid to start now rightand start with collecting it because youmay you may not be able to transition toEVS as a fleet right now just because ofvehicle availability but what you can dois start your journey towardstransportation decarbonization and thatmay come from you know reducing idlingin certain areas by changing driverBehavior right on maybe class eightheavy duty Vehicles where the charginginfrastructure isn't there necessarilyto support thatum but yeah start now make sure thatyou're collecting the right data becausethat's going to inform all of yourfuture decisions and there's nothingstopping you from starting now justbecause the EVS don't necessarily existfor your affiliate there's other waysthat you can move towards Transportationdecarbonization it's such a great way aframethat work in general inside companiesand just like sometimes it's a team ofone yesterday I was on the stage withthe chief sustainability officer fromPalo Alto networks and we were talkingabout them collecting sustainabilityinformation across their org and I saidwell Vince you know your team he goeswhat do you meanI don't have a team it's me but he saidI have these people throughout theorganizations which you know Logisticsis going to be one of those contributorshe said I have this community that'sbeen established across the org andthey're now starting to work with theirdata with this lens right and what wesee which is really fascinating amongstagain just I think our community ofsustainability leaders people in ourcompanies want to help so I I love whatyou said we recently did a Harris pollinside Google across 1500 Executivesspecific to sustainability because Ithink one of the other questions thatwe're getting right now is with all theeconomic headwinds everything that'sgoing on are people still working onsustainability does it still matter andI think what we saw was althoughsustainability went down in ranking it'sstill in the top three the otherinteresting thing that came out of thatstudy was that they may not saysustainability they say supply chainresilience they say adaptability rightthey say viability and so uh you knowjust thinking about that as we show uptogether and talking and Servicing allof our mutual customers I think we haveto be listening for those other keywordsand then like you said individuallylooking at the data that we have andthinking about how we can apply it tothese new use cases Shane I'd ask thesame from you like what uh what LessonsLearned would you offer to everyone Ithink Mike's on the right track which isstart nowum they're collecting good data is goingto help you because it sort of thesource of Truth really is the criticalpiece that gets buy-in from the rest ofthe business talked about theauditability Assurance piece likeknowing what is being recommended startswith having a good set of data we oftenfind a lot of our clients you know youtalk about the the CSO having it being ateam of one but having Champions aroundhim and I think it's going to be thesame for the Journey of decarbonizationthat people will start growing but theyall will have disparate pieces of datato input kind of bring to the table butI think it starts with a good data setit starts with and and honestly likeI've been working with geotab for a goodnumber of years now fantastic product itdoes stand Above the Rest in terms ofdata quality right and so for companylike ourselves it needs to have thattrust it it's it's really good workingwith the part-time that we can trust thedata all the time and know that what'scoming out is is is literally whathappened so the vehicle did do thisexact motionum these were the emissions this was theodometer and the external temperature soum building platforms on top of that forus also uh but start with start nowstart with the data collect someinformation at the very least you knowto your point you can start with otherdecarbonization activities like idlereduction driver training programs thoseare gonna move the needle that's rightand collect all theRoman tool yeah thethe up and said okay it's stillimportant they said you know we're a bithesitant to come out with these publiccommitments like we used to be becausewe did it we didn't have the data tosupport it we got some backlash from ourconsumers from our customers so nowwe're a little nervous about steppingforward and the the last question that Ithink Google really reinforced what canwe do to help and they said give ustools to measure it give us tools wherewe can go verify it and I thinkaspirationally that ask makes sense Ialso think what we're seeing from aregulatory structure is it's it is youknow sustainability data and financialdata they're intersecting and the sameobligation of how you do financialreporting and how you do sustainabilityreporting they really are comingtogether so like you said I one of thestories that Mike shared with me aboutthe different Fidelity of geotabtelematics that I love was when we talkabout driver swerving because I used tocommute a lot right and you were likehey if you had another telematicsprovider that that person could beswerving in the road right going 80miles an hour swerve but come back inand have really appropriate behavior youdon't have the right telematics that'sclicking out you know on a second bysecond basis connected to all thosesystems you would have missed it and youknow what it seemed it seems so uh maybesimple and trivial oh yeah what if Imiss a couple uh points here and therebut it makes a huge difference yeahespecially across 3.8 million exactlyadding this stuff up at scale and so theway that we just for those who aren'taware the way we kind of tackle our ourdata collection is through curve logicright so we're not necessarily capturingdata every second or every two secondsor every five seconds it's on thesethese error bar thresholds right so ifI'm driving down the highway or the orthe freeway you notice at a specificspeed I'm going to be collecting fewerpoints but if I happen to like jam onthe acceleration pedal and you knowoverpass and collecting more pointsalong the way soum it's based very much on these airthresholds those are so critical fordata and especially in this world of youknow generative AI where Data Trust anddata quality is so important people wantto know what actually did happen peopleare making decisions purchasingdecisions hiring despite this like thereare some serious decisions people aremaking based on this data and you haveto get the quality right so to thatpoint we do spend a lot of time on dataquality from the vehicle all the waythrough to the Myriad of pipelines thatwe have runningto get the data that is required to makethese decisions and if you look at thebroader impact on sustainability andcarbon inventory that companies or GSGinventory the companies have to nowsubmit to regular Regulators the SECwhoever the body or local taxauthorities are these things matterthat's right like if you get it wrongthere is actually going to be a Falloutif it is not correct I told everybody Ifeel like we're at that sarbanes-oxleymoment for us in sustainability whereit's starting to become very legitimatebut you guys thank you so much for allof the information that you provided Ihope these were great examples I'd loveto leave a few minutes for questionshere before I let you stand up though Idid want to let you know there's asurvey we'd love to get your feedbacklove to hear if these stories matter toyou if these ambition Loops that we'redescribing right if you can take actionon them so please provide us somefeedback but if there's any questionsand I will tell you that you gotta leaninto that mic for us to be able to hearyou so we'd love to see Chad I know Ican always count on you for a goodquestion we don't get it thank you somuchlean in there I'm not kidding hello umyou gave an anecdote of a company who uhwas looking to Electrify and youinitially gave them a number I think itwas in the low teens you said and thenlater you uh revised that number to bein maybe it was the 40s can youelaborate more on what led to that largeincrease in the recommendation was thatbattery capacity or vehicle availabilitybe it primarily vehicle availability iswhat that is what led to it right and soit's specific to that company would yousay that just a larger trend for acrossI think it's the worst thing that is alarger Trend so what we did it wasn'tjust for that company so if you look atyou know Enterprise Fleet Managementit's a it's a cross that the entirespace over 100 000 Vehicles went intothat study so it's not just one customerbut it's across the entire kind of um ahold of vehicles there and so from about20 20 to 2023 that's because of vehicleavailabilityyou were able to see that that increaseyeah thank youthank you for the question yeah thankyouhey good good morningum so just quick comment maybe notnecessarily question or maybe partiallyquestion is and you brought up the pointlike start small maybe with um idle timereductions Based on telematic data ormaybe route planning or you know there'sprobably there's dozens of ways but theother thing that you didn't really hiton and I think is also important is theScopes two and three reductions bymaking the choices you'll make withelectrifying your Fleet or maybe evenyou know going hybrid for your Fleet sobecause those especially if you're goingto talk about reporting and meetingsustainability goals for yourorganizationuh you know full life cycle emissionsfor example or your Scopes two and threeare going to also make an impact andthat will you know the decisions youmake on your Fleet will impact yourScopes two and three yeah and it goesalong thanks for the question it goesalong the line of the broadersustainability goals that institutionshave so look at a company like Walmart alot of their providers they're notconsidering their suppliers uh scope twoemissions as their scope three emissionsand they're actually going withproviders that have the ability to givethem that data as a source of Truth andreally be able to tell that story aroundhow the supply chain impacts somebodylike Walmart scope three so yes it youknow within the work that I do a lotwith other carbon inventory programsstop thinking about electrificationdecarbonization whatever it is as just apure cost center there is a profitCenter not just necessarily monetarilyright now but if you look at EVoperations over time cost of operatingin EV Fleet reduces over time butthere's other things carbon taxes in thefuture that might impact you as well butthere's a brand reputation that goeswith it as well if you start making thatcommitment to decarbonize your Fleetyour fleet's often the first thing thatpeople see about you you're on thehighways you're driving around you havebranded vehicles that impacts yourshareholders uh view on you as well soyeah scope T scope 2 in terms of yourbusiness and how you operate that Fleetlet's go through in terms of how thatdata impacts others is is significantlyimportant as wellI might add local head pleasesir and with larger organizations youknow scope three for exampleand on an individual level is very smallbut when you get a large Fleet you knowthat scope 3 is going to add up veryquickly and certainly should be part ofyour reporting yeah I think I think oneof the things to go look at potentiallyas well and again partnership with withDeloitte is from a Google perspective weare also thinking about uh justmodernization of the grid because a bigpart of the dependency here is like justdo we have the grid infrastructure tosupport it Google itself is like we'rein our third decade right of working onclimate action and and we were reallyfocused on data center efficiency so youknow obviously we went 100 renewable butnow we're working towards carbon freeand what Google is thinking about islike in order for our data centers to betruly 7 by 24 by 365 green energy We'veGot to Now inject Capital perhaps intothese areas where our data centers willbe right to build out solar windgeothermal Etc we have to work with theutilities in order to Green up theaccessibility to this energy and thisall impacts the charging infrastructurewhich is a dependency for you so again Ithink within Google Cloud at leastwithin our program we're bringing someof those energyyou know providers the flexi Dows therent energies the electricity Maps leveltens right all of those areparticipating in Google cloud readysustainability as well and we'll beshowing up in like future Solutions youknow that are coming out from Deloittearound like electrified grid and thingslike that so they'll all come togetherlike Shane said because I think I've hada lot of chats here at this the showabout scope threereally hard really really hard and Ithink we just have to address it withhumility and I think that the number onething I take away is it that we all asindividual organizations clean up ouract around scope one and scope two thenwe all clean up each other's scope threeright so great question thank you somuch just to build on that a little bitas well too you know you also have tolook at the power of this data at scaleso some of the things the work thatwe're we're doing uh within our geotabintelligent Transportation Systems lineof business is taking this aggregatedata at scale anonymized working withfolks like uh National Grid to look atthe Confluence of okay well I need tounderstand where the high voltage powerlines are coming and I need tounderstand truck movement patterns to beable to properly position charginginfrastructure for the future as welltoo so it's not only at the individualFleet level but now how do you take thisdata at scale aggregate privacycompliant work with you know the grid tobe able to figure out you know what doesthat deployment of the charginginfrastructure need to look like so veryexcited to continue to work withDeloitte and this is where all thebigquery nerds in the room were like Icould join this table with this tablewith this table right chat and ask thatquestion so thank you so I see my friendNick right yes yes how are youum I wanted to ask if you could speak alittle bit more to how you bridge thegap between uh board or executivemandates and individual employee buy-inand in particular what role data andanalytics plays in that such a greatquestion it's a great questionum I'll take one one stab at it so oneof the things that I've always been ahuge proponent of is like get the dataout of Fleet right like so often ourcustomers are the fleet managers and ourmission is to get outside of the fleetorganization and to the board level tomake sure that the right decisions canbe made I mean there are a few tacticsfrom a technology perspective that we'reusing to try and enable that and thegoal is to get it into the systems TheBusiness Systems within thoseorganizations that those Executives relyupon on a daily basis so um simplethings that you can do from a technologyperspective is make sure it's easilyintegratable right so you know we've gotdata connectors that that take that datafrom our Fleet platform and move it intoall sorts of bi platforms that theorganization is already using so thatthose those c-suite Executives who arelooking at these dashboards or who havethese dashboards displayed to themthey're not five steps removed from thedata which exists in the fleet platformright so getting it into the Enterprisedata strategy for these largerorganizations is one thing that is goingto highlight the importance of the dataat the c-suite that's only one step butthat's something that I've found hasstarted to resonate more and moreI think I think you know I'll justreinforce what I what I keep saying I Ifeel like uh you know obviously I run aprogram that's called Google cloud readysustainability and I think a lot oftimes when c-level Executives hear thatthey put me in a certain category youknow the projects that I'm going to workon the impact that we're going to havethe things that we're doing but when youapproach them and you start to talk moreabout long-term viability of theorganization right and it depends onwhat company you work for but I wouldsay that across the board everyorganization that we talk to isconcerned in one way or another aboutraw materials for their products they'reconcerned about logistics they'reconcerned about you know climate impactsto their organization and so I think wewe collectively as a group need to getbetter at translating thatsustainability actually meansoperational impact to these businessesright and it's people like you that thatlive and breathe this right that knowwhat's happening within your org you'rebringing a sustainability lens to it andyou're providing that translation if youcan take what Mike said about the datathat exists in the fleet put it into abusiness system and actually produce areport that says you know hey we couldpotentially save millions of dollars byelectrifying our Fleet you know throughyou know operational savings carbonemissions reductions or whatever thatthat to me is a sustainability story butwhat an executive hears their right islike operational efficiency I'mperforming for my shareholders Etc sothat would be some of my feedback whatabout you Shane yeah I think I meangetting the data out is criticalum not just putting it into bi platformsbut also putting it into your Erpsystems to be able to start havingpeople held accountable for some of thecommitments that they're makingum is is key there's some greatconnectors the lights built as well forsap article workday those kinds ofplatformsum that definitely can support that Iat the end of the day there's a lot ofupskilling that has to be done inEducation that has to be done on whatthis data means and what the impact isacross businesses for sustainability foryou know Capital Performance is a bunchof different areas but yeahgreat question thank youand Chadoh you know we're all in trouble rightyeah thanks Dee's for adding me for aquestion so uh I do have one and we'vetalked a lot about some happy thingslike hey this is the you know lean inChad the operational efficiency that youget or the savings that you getsustainability gains you get but Iwanted to ask about some uh unhappythings because when you think about theenergy transmission lines all the wayfrom generation to consumption liketransmission lines Just EnergyDistribution Systems and whatnot if youcreate a lot more Demand by positioninga network of charging stations aroundnow the you know the energy companieshave to supply those and then thetransmission supplies have to supply theenergy companies Etcso where does the story getsad again like where's the are therebottlenecks between energy generationand consumption what's the next problemthat we need to be thinking aboutassuming we've solved all of the stuffthat we've talked about here which wehaven't but what's the next one that wegot to worry about great resilience yeahand I think Chad it's such a greatquestion because like I said when we didstart to think about out you know goingout and making recommendations aboutelectrification it naturally led us toexactly what you're talking about we'reactually we could in some cases besetting people up for a non-satisfactoryexperience because they actually can'tget to electrification right just simplybecause of the grid infrastructure butinside Google as you know we've beenworking on 24x7 clean energy and wedidn't do that alone we've been workingwith various Partners again uh thinkingthrough partners that do actualum in some cases the first place tostart in my mind is to actually makemore energy available full stop isprobably just to optimize what we'realready usingso going into major energy intensiveassets and evaluating them again throughdata and saying can I just get them toperform better use less energy whichfrees up energy for the rest of usthat's point one the second point ismaybe start to talk to the utilities ina different way about how they collectdata meter data management Etc about howutilities are actually working a lot ofthem don't even understand the scope orthe requirements of the green balance onthe grid so maybe optimization of thesehigh energy intensive assets work withutilities to get better visibility intothe brown green balance and then startto move people onto this conversationabout Renewables I think that Google'sjourney is a great one for people towatch because we had that problem rightlike we wanted to make our data centersyou know we wanted to have this amazingstory about energy reduction andpotentially 100 renewable but when wewent out and looked at where ourexisting data centers were and where wewanted to build it didn't exist soGoogle actually had to go out and docapital investment actually support thebuild out of solar wind geothermal tosupport our own facilities and part ofthat frankly wasn't just Capitalinfusion it was policy we had to go workwith local policy makers to make surethat if we actually dispatched thisgreen energy could we buy it againinterconnection with the utilities andthen I think once that happens you startto understand okay I've got therenewable energy sort of build outhappening which is accelerating and Ithink you guys are tracking a lot ofthat at Deloitte and then the finalpiece is now I start acquiring therenewable energy and we start to getthat balance and so outside of this workalthough they're interconnected we havethis carbon free energy Journeyhappening with a bunch of other partnersthat are feeding into something likeelectrified grid from Deloitte whichshould hopefully continue the story chatbut it's such a great one that you raiseand it goes to the scope 2 and scopethree right scope one we may be able tosolve for I can't solve for scope twoand so I start cleaning up the gridslike you're mentioning so excellentexcellent observation and hopefully thata bit more detail you know is provideyou a bit of hope that we're thinkingthrough it but Shane I know like I saidI see Jamie in the audience thiselectrification of the grid is a bigdeal for you guys yeah it's a hugeconcern for us again the cleaning of thegrid immigrant well cleaning of thegreat great resilience ensuring that aswe make recommendations forelectrification and decarbonization wedon't inadvertently actually create aproblem and so we've been workingtirelessly with some of the localutilities across Canada and and in theUS as well to understand where they areand so grid planning happens 50 yearsout but if you look at the curve fortechnology adoption and electricityusage we're actually a little bitdisconnected from those 50-year plansand so we're trying to support them inthat aspect of let's bring multiple datasets the its platform of geotabs arefantastically important one because itgives us an understanding ofTransportation corridors once you startgetting into you know DC fast chargingof heavy trucks that's going to put amassive draw on on networks and usuallythere's not a significant Supply alonglarge Transportation corridors becausethere's gas stations you don't have tothink about that so all of these piecesinform a new asset where we've developedcalled electrified grid which doesexactly that takes into considerationthings like heat pump adoptionum like renewable use transportationelectrification and helps them plan fromthe endpoint so building endpoint allthe way back into the distributioncenter and transmission Network tofigure out where the failure pointsthat's right that will occur along theline well you guys this has been afantastic conversation full disclosurethese are two of the best partners thatI work with every day and so it's greatto be on stage with youum thank you so much for the audienceparticipation we hope you enjoyed thecontent and enjoy the last day of nextthank you[Applause]thank you"
