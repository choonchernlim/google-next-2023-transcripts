    "transcript": "foreign[Music]everybody thank you so much for comingtoday we're here to talk abouttransforming analytics and drivingInnovation with sap and Google Cloudhopefully this is where you uh wanted tobe today uhI want to introduce myself I'm MikeGraber I'm director of hyperscalercustomer engagement with sap and I havemy colleague up here Siva Siva do youwant to introduce yourself hi everyonemy name is siwa I'm part of Sap'splatform adoption and advisory team sowe work with sap and Google customers tobring up the Technologies to build theTechnologies and helps all the customerproblem and now we are very excited toshare this with you today great thankyou Sivaall right so as far as the agenda todaywe're going to do a little you know dothe intros we're going to talk a littlebit about sap btp in general if you'rethinking about integrating with sap aline of business applications like S4 orsuccess factors or any of thoseapplications you'll want to go throughbtp so we're going to have a littleintroduction on that we're also going totalk about data sphere the new productthat we're releasing that integrateswith Google bigquery which is fantasticand then we're going to do uh we'regoing to talk about some different usecases and things that we're thinkingabout that customers can do with thisand then finally we're going to talk alittle bit about the architecture Ithink we've got some challenges with thedemos today but we'll be available toshow you the demo after the the sessionand then finally we're going to go intoa little bit of roadmapso with thatlet's talk a little bit about the thelandscape and the ecosystem that we'redealing with today a lot of customersare investing in artificial intelligenceright it's a big topic obviously here atGoogle next it's it's a huge topicthe big challenge is in order to do AIyou need access to data and you need tobe able to get at the data in ways thatthat can train models and can do all thethings that that our customers arewanting to dowhat we're announcing or what we'retalking about today is this newpartnership that we have with Google andspecifically a new adapter that allowsus to integrate with Google bigquerywhich we think is groundbreaking andgame changing the idea of being able totake a pedoscale database like bigqueryand marry it up with the sap ecosystemis an incredibly powerful thingso let's talk a little bit about justbtp at firstso btp is Sap's platform for doingIntegrations extensions and analytics itis something that we've been investingin for quite a number of years thisrepresents a massive investment not onlyfrom being able to integrate with othersystems and extend the sap ecosystem butit's also underpinning all of ourproducts so it's it's something thatwe've been working on a platform thatcan sit underneath our products andenable us to do a lot of really greatthingsit is athe other great thing about btp is thatit also gives us the abilityto to sit on top of Google Cloudplatform so the idea that you can takeyour btp services and run it on top ofof Google cloud is another great thingthat enables uh that enables us to dosome some great stuffso bgp in general if you think about oursap line of business applications theysolve a lot of problems right but theydon't solve every problem nor do theygive you the ability to to necessarilyinnovate on top to do things that makeit specific to your company and that'swhere btp think of it as The Last Mileit's the last mile of being able to takeyour application and extend it andchange it and do things with it to makeit fit your Enterprise and fit what itis that you want to doso you may be asking yourself withbusiness technology platform there'sapproximately 94 different services thatwe offer with this platform now what'sinteresting about this is a lot ofcustomers ask me they say Mike when do Iuse btp and when do I use Google Cloudbecause there's a lot of very similarServices if you think about it we have adatabase right with Hana Cloud you'vegot a database with uh you know withbigquery or Google SQL right you alsohave you know various different dataLake technologies that are similar asyou go down the line you're going to seea lot of similarities in terms of whatthese products dowhat we're suggesting to our customersis is why would you use btp instead ofjust using hyperscaler technology likeGoogle Cloud platformand the reason you would use btp isbecause we can do things with theplatform that tied directly into what wedo that then ties directly into whatcustomers can do that are unique becausewe own the platformthings like for example we're notlimited to publicly facing apis we haveback planes where we can move data outand cache things from sap applicationsthat customers can then take advantageof so as we look through this and as wethink about where you would use btp andwhere you would use Google Cloud there'sa governance model that comes thatbecomes possible where you usesap applications or use btp to connectto sap applications and then you thenintegrate out to the greater Enterpriseecosystem and that's where we seethere's a lot of really great potentialfor tying in what btp can do with Googlecloud and and thus the announcement ofwhat we've announced with them to beable to do so generally speaking if youlook at btp and you look at thedifferent capabilities of what weprovide we have the ability through abunch of different services to be ableto connect out to Google Cloudcapabilities to be able to integratethat and in order to get to the sap lineof business applications we provide thatframework that allows you to connect outand see all of these differentcapabilitiesso let's talk a little bit about datasphere data sphere is the product thatwe are that basically to get at all sapdata you go through data sphere to getat it and data sphere provides a numberof different services that uh that we'regoing to talk about here today it givesyou the ability to doself-service data Access Data DiscoveryAdvanced orchestration to be able tomove data and process data the way youwant we have processing and persistencymodels we have data governance and wehave data ingestion capabilitiesthese capabilities give you everythingyou need to build what we're calling abusiness data Fabric and this businessdata fabric is how you will feed dataout of sap into other systems and infact what we're doing with the GoogleCloud uh big query capability is beingable to takesap applications move them through datasphere take the data outand what we're building is an adapterthat leverages the BQ streamingcapabilities of of a bigquery and beable to stream data in near real timeinto bigquery from sap this is a firstit will be released in in Q4 and thatand that adapter will give you theability to then tie into all of the datathat you want and be able to extract thedata out from bigquery and and sap datasources such as uh you know Hana or Hanacloud or or BW and be able to get thatdata out and be able to in real timereplicate the data over to bigquery wethink this is a great scenario for beingable to enable a ton of new applicationsand new solutions that weren't possiblebeforeso the other thing that I get questionsfrom from a lot of customers is when doI keep data in sap and when do I move itto the to uh to Google Cloud to bigqueryand why would I use which scenarioswould enable that so the first one Ilike talking about is if you're dealingwith huge data volumes say for exampleyou've got an iot situation where you'removing lots of telemetry data and youneed to be able to have a pedoscaledatabase like bigquery to be able tocapture that data but then I want to beable to mash up that data with data thatsits at sap maybe it's sales data Maybeit's marketing data and other thingsthat are stored in sap if the data isgreater than say 100 million rows youprobably are going to want to move thesap data to the to bigquery becauseyou're going to need low latencycapabilities to do analytics on it andthere's lots of use cases where that'sgoing to be necessarybut sometimes that's also not the casewhere you need to move the data ifyou've got accuracy and complianceissues so for example gdpr and cdprmpersonally identifiable informationif you keep that data inside the sapecosystem it's very easy to manage thatso if some if a person comes to you andsays I want to disappear from yoursystemsas long as it's an sap we're really goodat managing that but as soon as thatdata leaves sap it's up to our customersto figure out how to deal with thatright they have to manage those thosesystems at that point and a lot ofcustomers don't want to do that sotherefore we provide the ability to doFederated access to go back and pull theinformation when you need it by theapplication and you don't have to movethe data out of sapanother use case we come across quite abit is what we call data right back ifcustomers are doing a lot of planningscenarios and they want to be able toplan and see what's going on but thenyou you know so you're disconnecting thedata you're pulling the data out but asyou're planning you need to be able toget access to real-time informationabout what's going on that's a scenariowhere you're going to want to useFederation you're going to want to leavethe data in sap and those use cases makesense to leave it that way and thenfinally there are going to be timeswhere you have certain tools that youwant to use like for example vertex AIwhere you're going to want to be able topull the data out and be able to haveaccess to those those Advanced miningcapabilities and not necessarily leavethat in sap so there's lots of scenariosthat you're going to come across whereyou're going to need access to sap datain real time sitting in the Erp andother times you're going to need thedata and pull it out into the intobigquery in order to do something ininteresting with it and so we believethat the Better Together story with usand and Google Cloud platform is such apowerful story because it provides theability to get real-time access to datawhen you need it how you want to be ableto get at itall rightI'm now going to turn it over to Shebathanks MikeI want to talk to you about some of theuse cases and what customers are doingwith this architecture and the newconnector that we havelet me startlet me start with Richmond Richmondmanages many luxury Brands across theworld they are using sap and Google databoth data sphere and bigquery tointroduce new products to the marketthis helps them to connect the inventorydata and sales data coming in from sapsystem with their marketing data and themarketing spend data coming in from theGoogle and then be able to correlate andthen get insights so that they canoptimize their marketing spendaccordingly as well as they can improvetheir supply chain as wellHeartland they are using sap and Googleto process claims where they're bringingin data from sap system and thenconnecting with Google vertex AI tointelligently process claims as wellAlta Beauty they are using it forintroducing new products andrecommendations to customers they haveover 3500 skus coming in Brands and skusthat they have to manage over millionsand millions of customers so based onyour click-through patterns that areavailable from the Google analyticscorrelating that with sap data they areable to better recommend products totheir customersrodden and Fields they are able to getthe channel inventory from their Channelpartners and able to bring that into sapvia bigquery and they are able tointelligently alert and predictinventory so that they don't have accessinventory sitting at any given Channelpartnerso what can you do today there are manyareas where you would be able to bringthe sap and Google Technologies togetherstarting with planning you would be ableto bring in weather data on third-partynon-sap data from Google bigquerydirectly into your planning solution viadata a sphere and then be able to youknow simulate on what type of weatherpatterns would impact your sales andyour supply chain as well you'd be ableto use it in the marketing like with theexamples that I shared with you you canextend it for your Omni Channel your uhLogistics as well as your lob use caseas well you'd also be able to use sapdata directly in vertex AI for machinelearning other and expose it to yourapplications and all your Downstreamactivities this is really powerfulbecauseEnterprise data which sits in sap anddata sphere is now possible you it'spossible for you to access on Googlesite on Google data on the consumer dataand the third party data that sits onbigquery you are able to access itwithin data sphere as wellnow how do you get startedfirst connectivity you would be able toconnect all your existing on-prem Cloudsystems onto the business data fabricpowered by data sphere once you connectthe data be it on-prem or Cloud then youwould be able to seamlessly access thisdata set across your landscape that'sPro supported by the business datafabric so you'd be able to use it in SECfor analytics planning you'd be able touse it in bigquery for the use casesthat needs data set from SAP systems aswell then we also have prepackaged usecases which comes with its own model itsown predictive guidance and templatesand workflows that helps you to jumpstart and Implement use case on top ofthe business data fabric so all you needto do is just follow the guidedprocedure and you'll be able toimplement these use cases as wellonce you have the foundation thebusiness data Fabric and the you knowimportant use cases up and running thenyou can start innovating so you'll beable to do machine learning you'd beable to bring in generative AI use casesand so onso what are the packages that areavailable I'll go a little deeper on thespecific use cases and packages in thelater slide but the use cases haveeverything that you need to get up andrunning so right from connectivity toyour on-prem or your Cloud Solutions oryour lob Solutions and on the Googleside with the cortex framework fornon-sap data set it has all the modelson the dashboards and the workflows andthe reference architectures andpractices all included in those usecases the one of the examples that wehave is the sustainability use casewhere you'd be able to bring in sapsustainability control tower solutiontogether with the uh the third partydata set that tracks all your CO2emissions and everything and be able tovisualize that in sap analytics cloudonce you have everything in place thenyou will be able to use it for theInnovative the same platforms samemodels everything you'd be able to useit for the Innovative use cases be itmachine learning and generative AI usecases you heard a lot of announcementsthis morning on the generative AI you'dbe able to reuse all of that data withinyour compliance and the governanceParadigm in with together with yourgenerative AIso these are some of the use cases thatare available today with everything thatyou need to get and up and running sothis goes across the board so this hasplanning use cases supply chain planningfinancial planning it has categorymanagement retail Channel inventory andchannel management and also a few otherchannel inventory related use cases uhlike sell through and uh sell throughuplift and the channel inventory fromyour third level of channels as wellso each of these use cases are some ofthese use cases are specific for certainindustries but some of these are thatcut across the yellow bees as well andthe planning also has planning templatesthe planning model and brings in thebigquery data along with it forinfluencing your planningdouble click on two of these use casestoday and then share some details thesupply chain planning use case that youhavebrings in vertex Ai and Google bigquerydata like weather patterns into your ibpdata set to be able to intelligentlysimulate your planningone of the biggest challenge is thesimulation in planning right so youshould be able to simulate what if theweather pattern changes what how wouldmy forecast look based on my currentscenario so you would be able to do allof these on the fly with data sphereright so the federal connector thatexists today would be let you accessyour ibp and sap data directly withinvertex AI without having to go throughall of the Transformations because thedata is already clean so you would beable toyou know forecast each of the skus thatyou need to predict directly from withinthe ibp planning use case so this is areally powerful one and you don't haveto use these use case answers you'd beable to customize it as per yourbusiness need so all of the every everylayer of the use case is flexible andyou can customize it all the way fromthe data model onto the machine learningmodelthe Second Use case I wanted to talkabout is the quality management use caseso Katina X is a Consortium of theautomobile manufacturers partmanufacturers as well as many technologycompanies so we sap worked with Katina Xto bring in all of these different dataset that might be sitting across many ofthese companies to identify the qualityissues of the parts ahead of timethrough this solution the automobilemanufacturers and the partsmanufacturers are able to identify thequality in the parts almost 10 weeksahead of time that the intelligent parthere is when you try to analyze the rootcause of why a part is failing you wouldhave to simulate the environment inwhich the part is operating for examplebringing in the weather pattern was ittoo hard for many number of days like ithappened in Phoenix couple of weeks agoor is it extremely cold situation whereis this part is failing so you'd be ableto bring in this weather patterns fromGoogle on to the data sphere and you'dbe able to simulate it and identify theroot cause so this is a very excitinguse case that we have built togetherwith the Consortium membersnow uh the demo that we have today thereis some connectivity issue so it's notworking so I have this working live demoin our laptop so we'd be able to walkyou through as well but I wanted to walkyou through the entire solutionarchitecture and what can you do todayif that is one point that I want youguys to take away that is data sphere isyour gateway for accessing compliant sapdata no matter where so it could be fromthe machine learning vertex AI formachine learning from vertex AI it couldbe from GCS for replication with CDCcompliance or it could be for Federationwhere you need to bring in bigquery datainto the data sphere so data Federationreplication with change data capture aswell as for machine learning you wouldbe able to access over 65 000 CDs viewsthat is available as part of your sap S4system and many more that are availableon the other systems as wellas well as you'll be able to access allthe dsos that are available on the uh BWfor Hana system as well and be able toyou know manage one with one layeracross all of your systems so you'll beable to track your lineage or datalineage on where is your data goingDownstream if there is any change inyour Source system you'd be able totrack all the way to your bigquery uhand uh bigquery system even if you justreplicate the data set directly you'dalso be able to use your custom CDsviews as well available in sap systemaccess to via data sphere so data sphereis One Stop Shop for all of your sapdata needs and then it has some thespecial connectivities with bigquerythat helps you solve the businessproblemso demo not working because of theconnectivity issues so we'll beavailable after the session so you candirectly show this demo right off of ourlaptop so just let me know if that'sinterestinglast but not least the roadmap so wehave already released data sphere andSac analytics cloud in gcp today inNorth America so you we have many moreregions coming in in Q4 in just fewweeks from now it will be available inEurope as well as in apjwe also have the connective connectorsthe both the replication flow connectorto GCS as well as the Google bigquerystreaming connector available in fewweeks from now in Q4 we also have manymore regions planned so that you havethe choice of picking the region whereyou want to run your data sphere in 2024so if any of this is interesting andthat is also pilot program by the wayfor these connectors that are uh beingbuilt so if you're interested in joiningthe early adopted program let us know wewould be happy to work with our partnersat Google and then be able to get youonboarded as wellsothat's it for today so we have the demorunning so do let us know if you areinterested we can just walk you throughthe demo as well"
