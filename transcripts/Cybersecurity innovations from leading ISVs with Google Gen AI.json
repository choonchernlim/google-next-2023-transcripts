    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thank you everyone for for coming to tothe last session of the conference uhit's great to see everybody here we havea very exciting panel today we haveleading experts uh in AI in in securityindustry who will kind of walk usthrough uh how security and gen AI iscoming together and solving customerproblemsum so I'll start with with theintroductions uh with the panelists inthe end we will also leave 10 15 minutesfor questions so we'll be kind of happyto take any questions you haveum the only request will be kind of gotowards the mic as you ask yourquestionsum so first I'll start with how we Ithink with Paulo Auto networks we haveuh had a relationship for the last sixyears we started you know with initiallygetting their VM series firewallproducts onto Google Cloud then therelationship grew into having their SASServices cortex and Prisma access onGoogle Cloud we've been working veryclosely together to solve problems forsecurity practitioners and it's great tokind of keep working with Palo Alto onthe Gen AI space as well to bring theInnovations into the market so how ifyou could introduce yourself and yourrole at PollardHowie a senior vice president ofengineering and AI machine learningas you know as we you know going todiscuss the generative AI stuff thissession you know we are going to do alot more stuff with Google you know onthis type technology perfect thank youthank you and Ashwin next to uh Harvey Ithink Ashwin is from Talus we have beenworking with Talus for many many years avery important partner on the keymanagement external Key Management spacewas critical for Google and tellers towork together to make sure folks who arein more regulated kind countries whohave Banking and so forth to bring thosesolutions that we did many years ago wealso work very closely with them onSovereign Cloud use cases as sovereigntybecomes important and part of whatcompanies need we collaborate veryclosely on that so as soon if you couldintroduce yourself and your first of allthank you vineet for inviting me up tothis panel great to be here and thankyou everyone my name is Ashwin kamarajuand I lead worldwide engineering for abusiness line called Cloud protectionand Licensing for a company calledphallus and and we're part of a broaderGlobal business unit that does digitalidentity and securityperfect thank you thank you and movingon to Joe I think Joeum works for broadcom semantic and we'vebeen working with semantic for many manyyears as well uh as you guys may havealso heard semantic moved uh almostcompletely onto Google clouds all thesemantic Services now run on GoogleCloud we have been collaborating formany many years on building the nextgeneration of services and innovating inmany different areas in security so uhthanks to the semantic and broadcom towork with us on the Gen AI space as wellso Joe yeah your introductions yeah JoeChen semantic enterprise.com uh superexcited to be here uh I think we are Imy team approach on my LED semanticendpoint uh protection straightintelligence and the semantic secureresponse team we are engaged withcustomers in attackers 24 7.um and we also you know kind of takepride in uh interning Math and Scienceinto into action ball applications soI'll be excited to be part of this nowperfect thank you so I think jumpingstraight in on the meat of thediscussion is you know what use caseswhere gen AI can deliver the most valuein security there are many many areaswhere Jenny I can help so starting withyou how we you know what use cases andproblems you're looking at with Jenny Ican really help and what kind ofsolutions you're thinking of bringing tothe marketsure so just to set a stage a little bitpalato network is the largestindependent cyber security firm on theplanet as a company we have multiplepretty wide security products inparticular there's a you know moretraditional networking security but youknow zero trust The Sassy kind of theform factors and then there is a cloudsecurity right and then there is a sockplatform for the security the stockteams and then you know there are abunch of other things so when it comesto generative AI the way we think aboutgenerative AI is that you know we wantthe generative AI to redefine reimaginehow customers are going to interact withour productscustomer interact with our products youknow in many different ways you knowfrom the day they are evaluatinginstalling configuring configuring theproducts all the way to you knowtroubleshooting you know maybe customersupport you know there's a whole lifecycle right and we wanted to really youknow redefine that customer support isone of the use case that probably a lotof different Industries everyone istalking about that's an easy one so Ican start with that right you know todayif people want to fire a ticket theyneed to get a lot of the informationsright you know with the generative AI wewanted a customer to be able to you knowuse natural language interface uh prettyyou know simplified view right you knowand then there's more magic them youknow by the by by the generative AI nowgenerative AI as opposed to moretraditional AI one of the things youknow the the big difference of thegenerative AI is has a lot of the logicor has the you know the reasoningcapability and it has the programmingcapability so it's not just you knowpeople call it a large language modelright you know language model it'sactually in some ways a misnomer becauseit's not just for language or naturallanguage it's actually doing a long morethan that you know reasoning capabilitythe automation so in particular rightyou know if customers having some issuesyou know we want you know somecorrelation to be that we want somereasoning to be done we want that to bedone behind the scene for customers sothat you know a customer don't have tostruggle okay looking at this statslooking at that stats let me actuallyfigure out what do I do you know howshould I you know what should I tell myvendor you know all that kind of thingsso that's just the customer support soit's more than just a give you a chatbot right you know a natural languageinterface there's a lot of the reasoningcapability we leverage so that's just uhyou know that that's one uh the otherthing is you know theum most of our customers they use ourwhether data lake or whether they have alot of telemetry they have a lot of theconfiguration they have a lot of datawith us and we want them uh to be ableto talk to the data you know almostdirectly so that they can see what's thevalue today or in the past there'salways some workflow right you can clickthis button you go through some workflowyou see hey how many threads I have inthe last 24 hours you know all that sortof things however those workflowsthere's a limited workflow and how tonavigate them it's it's not necessarilyeasy right you know probably all of youat some point of your career you use theMicrosoft the world at some point rightand you know you probably only use onepercent of the feature or ten percent ofthe feature at most and same thing withany other Enterprise software productincluding the cyber security so wewanted our customer to be able tonavigate our products easier so that youknow maybe a lot of the the workflow isalready there we can help you tonavigate uh via the natural languageinterface maybe the workflow is notthere but we have the Telemetry therenow you have an interface to the productso that you can actually talk to theproduct you can talk to the datadirectly figuring out you know we wehave one customer you know the other dayasking us hey you know you know we havethis product called Aiden basically adigital experiencesort of the monitoring and themanagement sort of the software uh veryvery useful for people to know what'sgoing on right with the zoom you know uhZoom call or some security issues healthor that sort of thingum the customer wanted to know hey formy all my customers well all my users inLondonuh you know tell me you know what'sgoing on sure we actually have aworkflow doing exactly that but what ifthe the custom my users in London andyou know those people who work from homeyou know we don't quite have theworkflow you know doing that in the pastyou know the customer has to talk to theproduct manager who product managertalking to the you know engineering teamprioritize that you know maybe have arelease in three weeks three months orsix months depending on the life cycleof the product uh that's that's thatthat's that's a process now you knowbecause we have the you know the thedata already there and then we have thisgenerative AI layer right you know theco-pilot or assistant you know theindustry people call it the differentways we haven't officially launched theannouncement that's why I want to sortof stay vague on the naming part but youknow that the co-pilot concept you knowhas been there right you know havingthat co-pilot thing you know between thedata and then the user now you canactually talk to the data directory youget a visibility you need to you get aninsights directly that's a huge hugeRevolution it's amazing to hear you knowthere's so many different use cases insecurity where Jenny I will help youknow everything from reducing the toilthe tasks that are repetitive maybebetter security detection use cases arethere as well as well as what how he wastalking about bringing expertise througha llms that is harder to get by hiringmore people so there are many many areasit's great to hear you know Paulo Altois looking into such a broad array ofSolutions on Jenny we can get you thesoccer sort of the use case a little bitlater but you know I already give twoyou know very concrete use cases justnow right you know one is the customersupport or how to speed up speed up thesupport and then the other one is forthe user to you know talk to the datadirectly but it's more than that rightyou know that you think you think aboutthe day zero day one day and experienceevery single step of the way you aredoing if you have the assistant orco-pilot assisting you you know so manygood things could have happened perfectthank you so Ashwin um Howard's kind oftell us thinking about there was anannouncement on Cipher trust alreadyusing a gen AI so it'll be exciting tohear what you guys are thinking surefirst uh let me start with what ourportfolios like at least in our businessline uh so we have data securityproducts which is a lot of theencryption and key management and thatsort of addresses a lot of thesovereignty requirements we haveidentity and access management as wellas software monetization which does morelicensing and title management Revenuein scienceuh we've been a great partner right forover four four and a half years we'vebeen on a journeyboth in terms of our services beinghosted on gcp as well as go to markettype of Partnerships and uh as a companyour parent company Talus operates theSovereign Cloud for Google in France Ithink there was a session a couple ofdays ago and also we are leading uh sortof a company in data security and youmight have uh gone to a presentation acouple of days ago on the keys to thekingdom yeah those are encryption Keysuh but uh beyond that we have a deviceto Cloud strategy so we offer Hardwaresoftware and as a service uh type ofproductsandwe started thinking about generative Aiand how that can be used in variousaspects in our business line and similarto what hubby said uh first you knowthere was a project in marketing then wethought about customer supporthow do we use it in our products andalso how do we think about Cloudsecurity posture management right forall our public facing cloud servicesand in marketing uh you know the projectthey chose was how do we use like theinformation we haveto actually create a superior customerexperience like a buyer's guidetargeted for their industry right orvertical and and that's what we'reworking on so it's really aconversational info bite that we'rebuilding that'll tailor to the customersquestionswe haven't yet started anything in thecustomer support area that's that's nextbut what I want to talk about is reallywhat are we doing in the product spacewhich is a little bit more uh complexand and how do we actually make thatavailable in the products to provide adifferentiated value proposition so oneof the products we have in our portfoliois uh in in the cipher trust platform isa data Discovery and classifications sodata privacy sovereignty all that isextremely important in the face of agrowing number of regulatoryrequirements not only here but all overthe world every country is very veryserious about it and we are have aproduct that provides the discovery ofthe sensitive data you know on all ofthe customer data assetsand classifies that in you know intobased on info types right is this PCIData or is this HIPAA data is this piifor various different uh reasons andthat information can be used by the CSOor the compliance officer to find outwhere they have vulnerability in termsof exposed sensitive information andremediate that rightso how do we do that so we've been usingregular Expressions which is kind of awell-known uh you know search or scanmethod to do pattern matching and thenderive where the sensitive informationisbut it fails when it gets into complexvariations across different types offiles and repositories and we want totie it all back together right like aperson's information is in very manydifferent repositoriesso that's when we started exploring uhyou know named entity recognition typeof techniques machine learning and howdo we build some models and one of thesort of problems we have is we don'thave enough of a corpus of data right totrain our models and we definitely haveto ship with some pre-trained models butalsocreate a framework in which customerscan start training new models on theirdata and another challenge we face iscustomers don't like their data to leavetheir premise right or at least theywant to know what are the guard rails inplace is this being meeting all the dataresidency requirements is it not goinginto some other country we have toaddress all of those and and that'swhere you know I think we had uh ahamovements and looked at generative AIfrom Google and and we kicked off acollaborative project and uh we're stillearly but we had some great uh you knowearly uh success we leveraged the vertexAi and the model garden and the featurestoresand the llms there to pre-train our ownmodels right and and so that we cancreate that Pipeline and then we cantake that model and deploy it on the endpoints with our customers right uh andso in you know the successes we actuallybuilt a classifier text classifier modeland and we of course being early we raninto some bumps right the vertex AI uhembedded text processing engines onlyparse text pure text or tabular dataright whereas in reality you have dataand you know so many different formatsright whether it's PDFs or excels or anyof these things right so we workedaround it uh and uh we used an Apache uhticker to actually be able to go as partof our data preparation and and and sortof prepare the embeddings and all thatstuff so that was one and we of coursegive feedback and you know because wecollaborate and help Google also toimprove based on customer requirementsuh we also sort of experimented withdocument Ai and and sort of thelimitation was more PDFs only our imagesonly but we started looking at that aswell and how we can use that and I wasat the one of the sessions a couple ofdays ago and very excited they're thebuilding generative AI applicationextensions right sothe llmssort of have stale data presumably rightbut how do you provide more real-time orcustomer related information context tothese llms so they're allowing us appdevelopers to actually write apis thatthe llms can callso they can complement whatever theycome up withto have better more insightful contextright so we're looking at all of theseand you know the journey continues rightso thank you and there's a lot ofexciting Innovation happening and Ithink the key is you know workingtogether there's Innovation that'salready on the table there's moreInnovation that will come out of Googlethat will help but the key is you knowfor the security practitioner we aretrying to work with the key players inthe industry and figure out how can wetake security in the next level how canllm reduce the effort it takes to kindof secure your companies and it makes iteasier and so you can do more with theproducts than Investments you alreadyhave right right with that Joe I thinkthere was exciting announcementsyesterday around semantic using gen AIso why don't you tell us a little bitabout the use cases the problems you'resolving and how surethis is one use case uh actuallymentioned I I kind of resonate with melike in the in the age of Google nextCloud you are also solving some problemsand some of the hardest on-prem problemsright so like you you know supportingon-premise certainly not a hindrance butalso like you make sure these largeInvestments were regulation privacy it'sa large concern you know working alongwith them so that's that's certainlypart of our consideration so not toolong ago I said we were not too long agouh maybe it feels like years now if youin the age of gen of AI there was blackhat here right so you attend here it's alot of excitement every single companyhere has been on Jennifer AI somehowsomewhere at their booths right largelyleads to a demo to a sales team right sowhen we return the teamwith internally in the organization yousee the same thing Engineers excited pand excited right customers asking aboutit customers expect us all of us to usebetter breed right also expects us touse latest tools right so you have toreally respond and see how we'rethinking about it and now see at aposition as a security Avenger we havemany challenges wein some ways our infrastructure softwarewe enablethe largest Enterprises some of themhave larger development houses you knowthan us right so how do you make surethey can safely Leveragethis technology now is ubiquitousincluding the attackers right ubiquitousto in such a way that they can use itsafely do they have concerns about dataprivacy you absolutely do same thing wedo hallucination yes we all do right soin on one end we are providing solutionand daily prevention at the rtlp cloudproduct uh also young announced uhyesterday right but to provide asolution without actually using it andexperimenting and do yourself it's youknow it's it's a it's not the bestapproach right so certainly as Engineershow do you harness all the energyinternally now you also leverage yourbest right so we we made a BET right onGoogle's uh platform it made it prettysimple so all the concerns aboutgovernance tongue said pages and pagesof lawyer paperwork we because our datais already on gcp Fast Forward gettingvertex engine we're ready to able to uhstart experimentationhaving access to a sec Palm we were ableto uh proceed with experiments right soin the caseyou know we kind of went into this withicewide open knowing thatin that training data without ourtraining data may not perform the bestright so like I think we the humblyapproach of working together givingfeedback we are improving I think Iwould say we help improveyou know Google's uh um version of uhSAC bomb that's that's providing to usin turn that enables us to do betterright so aside from a product forcustomers now let's talk about theproblems that we are also trying to tryto resolve ourselves internally we needto get better we need to be able to bemore efficient right so we can go tacklethe biggest problems and I think thatthat's a very good angle of you as acustomer of Google Cloud are also a verybig customer so as a consumer of cloudservices these companies also have toprotect their own environment so thatperspective will be very interesting aswell that's right I I think you knowit's a it's it's it's the the problemwith separate security is it's a fairlydurable one it's a challenge where youyou try to you're constantly trying toimprove your protection for ourcustomers without your trainingcarefully with all the guardrails youdon't have false positives right that'sthat's the forever that's it you wantyour disposition from machine learningyou know which I think we're it's thatspread and butter for us now like youknow 75 of all these positions today oneway or another across a portfolio that'sAI based right so now how do you tacklelast percent with Jennifer AI right howdo you do that further more so youautomate more so our our humanintelligence around the globe the guysare working 24 7 is able to tackle thelast bit last bit last bit it's a youknow it's approaching Infinity that'syou know that's I think that's a hardand challenging portion of the theproblem soum so I you know it's uhit's a it's not a product but today youknow the largest customers whether usingsassy or a semantic sassy using our ourendpoint using DLP using cast V whateverright if you were to submita a Nile C to cementia day the responsethe description you get back may beassisted by gender of AI that we haveput in production okay it's it's a it'sa you know it's limited use but we wantto make sure we're doing this right uhmake sure we're not we're not causingfalse positives or issues in your mostcritical infrastructure right I thinkthat's actually the key of understandingas part as we grow with the largest inthe pricesum so now it's exciting to hear even thekind of feedback loop from customers andhow it gets embedded into the productthat whole thing will get speeded upwith an AIum it's so exciting I think the securityindustry as a whole and how customersprotect their environments will becompletely different in a year with GenAI kind of powering and helping in manydifferent areas yeah so one commonquestion hobby that we get and folks arelooking at is the size of these modelsright as you know a lot of companies arelooking at building these models andthen eventually the security teams thatthat are in the room as well will belooking at how do we protect thosemodels so how are you guys based on youknow you guys are heavily involved ingen Ai and AI work how are you seeingopen source models versus companieslooking at a platform like vertex tobuild their AI Solutions how is thatevolving yeah that's a good question soyou know just like any computer scienceproblem right you know you kind of uhyou look at it probably it's not like awood size fits all right you know thereare very very sophistic things youprobably need a Frontier Model A largemodel the the large Foundation modelfrom Google you know of you know open AIof the world to help you to sort of giveyou that Frontier performance but thenthere are you know other use cases rightyou know smaller model maybe sevenbillion parameters or smaller thatthat's sufficient enough to to do whatyou want to do it's almost like you knowif you look at a computer or a PCthere's a you know Intel CPU and thenthere are gazillion chips right it's notlike one CPU does everything so so theway I look at it it is is there is aneed for the Frontier Model to havebetter and better performance that'swhat we are working with Google team alot right on the daily basis you knowpushing back and forth you know andhopefully you know get get better andbetter you know for our solution and forthe Google model and then you knowoverall for customers to have a bettersolution but then you know they'realways you know plenty of use cases thata smaller model open source model wouldbe uh would it be sufficient you know weare also you know even for open sourcemodel we work with Google hopefullyGoogle is going to you know scale theoperation influence of those you know uhopen source model as well so so I see aneed for Frontier Model to you knowAdvance you know even 10x from here onin the next few years but I also seethat an open source model as as you knowas is today it can already solve a lotof the you know interesting problemsyeahperfect and Ashwin there was kind of inyour world you see a lot of on-prem andcloud and hybrid world so how would thisadoption of gen AI evolve in in thiskind of mixed environment world as wellyeah so I think we'll be looking athybrid uh models right some it's sosensitive and so secure not only in insort of the business line I work in butour company does a lot of Defenserelated work as well so we haveclassification of the security level sofor that we almost have to say hey thellm and the entire data repositorieswill be on-prem but they'll be sort of amore of a tiered hierarchy right wheresome of the data can reside in a cloudAI platform such as vertex Ai and andwe'll leverage that so we're still earlyin how we actually go to the extremelevels of security and assurance and andI think Google is also working on highassurance workloads and how to handlethat so we'll be collaborating andthinking about those things yeah perfectperfect Joe your perspective well I likewhat uh how is one notion around uh noone-size-fits all uh I think that's thethat's the impetus of uh you know kindof the problem and especially thelargest Enterprises the sophisticatedenvironments they're in they're alldifferent so I'll say you know kind ofsince the since the since theacquisition broadcom semi anti we wereable to kind of look at this customizedsolution in such a way that provide atailored suit for every single customerit's a tailor-made custom solution whatwe call we call adaptive security it'sgot to be Taylor fit to me the customersin need that's different that's uniquelyyou know that's different that's uniquefor their environment right so that'sreally beautiful and I I think havinggenerous AI only accelerates our abilityto be able to make that tailor-made suitand do this so much faster for ourcustomer I I you know I I think that's ait's a key enabler uh for us to besuccessful perfect I think anotherimportant topic and top of mind forfolks now is that the developers havestarted building gen AI applicationsadopting gen AI in the cloud as wellnow they have the security practitionershave the task of securing thoseapplications so how are you guysthinking about what Palo Alto would doto have solutions that protect theseapplications that are being built andare powered by Gene Ai and how does itkind of pan out between a platformapproach versus companies may decide tobuild their own models how wouldSecurity address those different kind ofuse cases as well yeah I think you knowthe generative AI technology has evolvedvery fast in the last half a year or soright you know ever since you know thething uh it didn't came out last yearbut you know sort of get a popularityyou know since end of last year I thinkthat's probably true to say and uh a lothas happened in the last half a yearalso right people most Enterprises wentfrom didn't know anything aboutgenerative AI to right you knoweveryone's talking about genuine awarewithin roughly half a year or so so Ithink it naturally first thing you knowpeople a lot of customers our owncustomers are apprehensive but hey youknow you know this thing you know whatif the sensitive information got leakedor whatnot a day first thing they ask ishey is there any way to block the accessto it right not necessarily that thebest thing to do in the long term butthat's sort of immediate sort ofreaction from some of the customers sowe give them that choice our NGAfirewall you know has that functionalityso that if you really want to do it youhave that capability to do that rightbut what you are asking is you know morelong-term right you know it's actuallyyou know this is a more just a one sortof a black and white solution but youknow but in the long run we want in theworld so here's how I see it right youknow everyone who has heard aboutco-pilot you know assistant right youknow Bots you know chatbots or whatnot Ithink you know in in a few years I thinkin a few short years like five or tenyears likely in less than five yearswe're going to have you know lots oflots of co-pilots right you may haveheard a co-pilots from some majorcompanies in your here at the concertfrom us you know hear from you know manyother every enterprise software everypotentially security company will havetheir co-pilot and in that world righthow do we make sure that you know thoseyou know first class citizens you knowyou know that the co-pilot will be saferight and uh that's a that's a big dealright you know because we are we're youknow it's like a cloud that came in thelast decade and now we are trying toprotect the all the entities on thecloud same thing with the co-pilot rightyou know when the co-pilot became thethe first car citizen over the next fewyearsum today it's in the PR but you know inthe next few years it will be in the inthe in the deployment and how do weprotect them how do we make sure thatthey are safe really you know a lot ofnetwork being the you know the largestsecurity company it is something thatworks you know and uh one thing I wantto say is you know for our own you knowthe uh generative AI solution co-pilotor system like a technology we are goingto announce or launch or you know uhgive to their customers we'll do a lotof the red teaming and all those thingsourselves right just like you know it'sa new platform and it's a new new entityand then a lot of those Technologies aregoing to be relevant for you knowgazillion other core Pilots out there sowe wanted to sort of be you know um uhyou know give that as a product to ourcustomers as well so it will come youknow but yeah I think it's a fastevolving space yeah I think we'reworking very closely with the keyplayers in the security industry tryingto kind of come up with standards aswell so as folks are looking at gen AIapplications and trying to figure outhow do I secure it there are morestandards that they could follow morenist like standards or other alliancesthat companies form so it becomes easierto protect gen AI applications as theyare built so ashun what are you hearingfrom customers and what are theirconcerns how are they thinking aboutsecurity of the apps that are coming outthe door very quickly yeah I mean it'sit's still early all right and uh so faryou know not too much in in terms of uhspecifics about hey how how is generatedAI going to impact the applications yeahor how are you securing it for us we area security company as well right and adata security company secured by Designand privacy by Design are core tenets ofwhat we doso I think what we have to answer tocustomers is an extension of our dataprivacy policies and disclose you knowhow we are using generative AI in in anyof the services or products and what arethe guard rails we have in place becausethe customers will ask right but it'salso a sort of a leap of faith and and atestament if you've been to the expohall you'll see companies like DeutscheBank who's thereshowcasing how they are building theirown apps right so so I think they willnaturallybe a lot more uh cautious and andthey're making that leap of faith andactually experimenting with these uhgenerative AI models and we will supportthem right and and the feedback that weget will actually Implement take it backto Google as well right and togetherwe'll put enough rails and make surethat data privacy data residency typesof requirements are always met rightyeah perfect enjoy any things you'rehearing from customers still early dayssome initial feedback on customers whatproblems they're thinking about yeahI'll give you two examples One externalmaybe we'll enter all these questionsall right the external one will be HeyJoe uh largest banks hey uh is itpossible for your web categorization toto categorize all the all the URLs thatwe can possibly be related to open aigenif ai use cases so we can apply apolicy whether allow or deny right sothat's that's a very real one so theycan apply policy so that exists today inall the networking uh related productsoffer estimated Tech so that Itself bythe way we are applying Jennifer AI topeople that help us categorize categoryof URLsumand two internally internally I think Ithink the largest security problem islike you know it's uh you know years agoyears ago we either target attackstarget attacks the most sophisticatednation state attacks right semantic cameout with stocks net paperum internally was with a question wealways ask and say how do we how do weproduce and replicate the generativemodel of the brains of Leon or Machuwho's in the audience with us and EricChan you know the guys that use data tobe able to the first one to to kind ofdisclose this nation-state attacks righthow do I do that so so that you knowit's it's that's a big question andthat's the approach kind of we'rethinking about so with the most complexproblems that you know these mostsophisticated attackers will alwaysemploy the you know the the mostexclusive tools and we're fairly happythat we are you know we're writing on onleveraging on some pretty greatpartnership so here so we think we'regoing to do uh we're gonna do well yeahand the internal thing is is coming up alot right becausewe have all the developers or yeahanyone else who wants to use uh you knowgenerally where I generate the code orcan we use that you knowis a little ambiguous right what is thecopyrights and all that stuff so got tobe very careful uh and and are we oursister would be concerned about are wesharing our confidential informationto uh you know these platforms Innovait's a great thing I think you guys youknow building your own SAS Services youhave to kind of think about protectingyour own assets as well so you're almostdog fooding your own products rightbefore they go out so I think theInnovation it will help speed up theInnovation because you're kind of goingthrough that customer life cycle on youmix it makes it more real right yeahit's a sheer problem sure challengesyeah so I think uh we'll leave fiveminutes for questions but one last roundof uh question that may be interestingsoI'll go Joe starting with you this timeany one area that you feel securitypractitioners would be delighted if youlook you know a couple of years outwhich problem do you think will be mostimpacted with what gen AI can bring tothe tablecustomizationcustomer ability to to do very timeconsuming complex descriptivecustomizationuh oh my Engineers will say you knowthat especially the guys are really goodat reverse they're really good atAssembly Language but they're not goodat English but you know they will beexcited that they will take over thejobs that they don't really enjoy doingand so they can focus on uh you knowother things more important jobs but Ithink customization to allow an Adaptiveworld where the adversary is alsoconstantly evolving with the newesttools I uh you know I look forward to uhkind of see what what's to come therethere was some discussion in theindustry it will be interesting world ofllms trying to attack an llm trying todefend as well so yeah it's a very veryinteresting world yeah I think there's alot to be sort of thinking about rightuh I think you nowhave to bring this whole AI platformsand nlms into your threat universeuh you know the attack vectors are goingto change so you're going to have thingslike data poisoning or if all the datathat you're trying to use to train themodels is going to be poison yeah rightor there's model stealing that'shappened that could happen uh there aresort ofyou know all these new threat vectorsthat are going to come into playand I think for security practitionersuh and and I'll just quote what Googleand others are doing alreadycollaboratively to create a secure AIframework right I think they have somegooduh sort of recommendations and how doyou want to uh sort of extend whatpractices you already have thefoundations right the shift leftsoftware development pipelines to threatresearchto be inclusive of these AI platformsinclusive of the large language modelsso that you don't have uh you know thosebreaches happening right in theseplatforms so these are new platformscoming into your threat universe so Ithink some standards and collaborationwith mist and all that is alreadyhappening and I think there'll be somegood good recommendations thatpractitioners should uh how what shouldsecurity practitioners should be lookingforward to in the next next six months12 months yeah yeah yeah so I think youknow with the generative AI conversationin the last you know many months rightyou know a lot of people are asking heyis the security or actually not yourmother security just professionals jobsare going to be gone or replaced allthat sort of things right so to answeryour question I think for the quiteforeseeable future right you know in thenext two or three years I actually seethat as security professional's life isgoing to get better and the betterbeforeI even get you the water better and thebetter I give you one stats right in thein the last five or ten years or so at agiven time uh there are approximatelyfour million security professionalopeningsum unfilled meaning that you know we weneed a lot more Security Professionalsbut we cannot feel the job that's itthat's a constant stats in the last fouryou know uh five or ten years and evento fill that hole right you know we needa not a lonely you know job beingreplaced or not you know one of theproducts in my team in my organizationis the AR Ops you know the the the ideaof the aops is to to to replace a lot ofthe repetitive stuff that people aredoing right you knowum the the mission we have is actuallyreally to reimagine how people are doingthe cyber security think about all thesort of the oh this you know the the uhthe CPU is busy or that there is a debtissue I need to replace a part I need todo I mean we want the AI to you knowknow this information ahead of you sothat the tickets are filed or the issueis remediated before you know you evendo this right so that you can focus onthe more higher level uh the the morebusiness related work you know giventhat there's so many unfair you know somany openings out there you know peopleare doing repetitive stuff right youknow I think life will be better nowthat being said just like any technologyCloud you know the uh the degenerativeAI you know the technology will be usedby the good guys by the vendors you knowcan be used by the bad guys so I'm notsaying that everything will be Rosy justbecause we leverage this technology weare going to you know make your lifebetter you know the bad guys are goingto you know also giving more and morechallenges that's why the cyber securityworld is going to is an evergreen youknow interesting industry right but thatbeing said I do I do fully anticipate alot of the stuff like my own team isdoing it with the AI office with theAdam with the other the the automatedstuff right you know it's going to makeyour life uh far better and and more youknow you you can resolve issues uhfaster perfectly reduce toil right yeahyeah thank you I think this was veryintriguing discussion I think I'mlooking forward to you know how thisevolves and how we collaborate thank youthank you thank you
