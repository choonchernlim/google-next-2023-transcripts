for the sixth year in a rowI am super super excited to present toyou together with my customer and mypartner and my friend sentio theirincredible migration to Google cloud andthe adoption of its broad Suite ofTechnologies uh maybe if you can give mea quick introduction to our audience andand break down digital termmy name is sentel I'm the CTO at digitalturbine digital turbine is a companythat's in the mobile advertising mobilemonetizationecosystem and we Empower and enable appPublishers and advertisers and brandadvertisers on our platform so if I if Iwere to like take a step back andplaying what digital turbine is aboutrightwe have built a network of partners thathave adopted our technology on mobilephones and when I say Network orPartners these are mostly mobilecarriers and oems mobile oems that haveadopted our technology on their devicesand we have over 800 million phonesmobile phones that have our technologyon those forms right and so when youhave that sort of a reach right youactually enable monetization at scaleright and not only are we on devices onmobile phones but we are also in appsI'm talking about like scale where youknow we have a 5 billion app installsthrough our platforms so far right Imean this is like you know massive scaleandum when if you look at it through thelens of an app publisher right if youhave a digital product right the biggestproblem that you have is how do you getyour digital products on a mobile deviceand because of the network of partnersthat have adopted our technology weactually enable these digital productsto find their way onto you know mobiledevices and then in addition to that youknow with app advertisers and brandadvertisers we essentially create acompelling story nowumif you are a mobile app publisher rightum one of your biggestcosts is marketing sure how do you findyou know users the user acquisition is avery you know big host for a mobilepublisher and then um you know becauseof of how we have built thatnetwork of devices that we have itactually allows you to find your wayonto the device but then if you look atBrand advertisers you know it's notabout distribution of apps right butit's about brand lift brand awarenessright and being able to tell acompelling story and the in-app presencethat we have allows the in-app and owndevice presence that we have allow us toenable brand advertisers to tell theirstories in a creative way through ourplatformso you're this connective tissue betweenour application developers Global Brandsand all of the telcos that are requiredto bring their products to Market ifthat's the scale of what you're buildingwhat's the scale of what you have todeliver in order to make that real rightthe systems for that have to beincredible absolutely right uh thenumbers that you see up there are justyou know some examples of actual actualnumbers from you know one of ourplatforms right this is not all of theplatforms that we haveum you know just looking at things like10 terabytes of data a day that wegenerate one billion uh ad Impressionsthat we serve on a daily basis and thenone trillion outgoing transactions perday right that's the type of scale weare talking about on our systemsum at any point in time you know justone single platform of ours runs thirtythousand to fifty thousand cores rightat any point in time so that's the typeof scale that we are talking about rightand we need this type of scale when weare talking about you know at scale adplatform right the ad exchange thedemand side platforms that we have andthat combined with you know knowhundreds of millions of devices and youknow appsthe in-app presence that we haverequires us to you know build scale andsupport a certain level of complexityand sophistication of our platform andwe need them these are the kinds oftraffic numbers I remember from being agoogler yeah so seeing it in athird-party system it's it's it's prettydaunting that's it's really anincredible achievementI you know what was the opportunity infront of digital turbine that thatsuggested Google was the way to goum being uha company that participates in theAndroid ecosystem right uh we felt itwas strategy it was like reallyimportant for us to be close to Googleright um from a strategy perspectiverightum and so that was I would say one ofthem one of the motivations right whichis hey let's get close to the companythat you know plays a major role in howthis is ecosystem develops and have theability to kind of participate in howyou know uh the ecosystem and thetechnology that powers it you knowevolves in addition to that right theother opportunity for us was reallylooking to see if there are base of youknow getting better operationalefficiency from our systems but alsofrom a course perspective right for thistype of scale rightum coast and Coast optimization and youknow anything that we can actually do toget that you know scalescaled with the better Coast constructdefinitely made sense for us so it'sit's one thing to have to handle amonster it's another thing to have to doit at a price performance that keeps youahead let's let's maybe dive deeper intosome of the specific opportunities youmoved from AWS to gcp you know what weresome of the factors or or key featuresthat you consideredyeahumI would saymoving from AWS to gcp it was not for usit was not just about a lift and shiftright I think many companies go look atit through the lens of hey let's youknow lift and shift and honestly that'sthe way we started sure when we startedwe're like hey let's lift and shift butthat very quickly developed into liftmodernize and shift right so it becamemore of hey what are the things that wewant to do at a platform level thatgives us the ability to you know operateat scale with maybe more Automation andto also reduce the burden on our teamsright and when I say burden on the teamsyou know we we were a pretty devopsheavy organization and we will continueto be a pretty devops organization thequestion is can weum you know structure our workloads insuch a way that the devops heavyportions are where we actually need ourteam's brain power right I mean we havesome real really smart Engineers who dothis and you know we should give themthe ability to kind of apply that youknow with regards to building productsand so one area for example is you knowEnterprise automation right like how dowe when we go through this journey ofyou know lift modernize and shift whatare the things that we want to do at aninfrastructure level that enables us tobring in the ability to run fasterintroduce velocity the ability to youknow have more than you know n number ofreleases you know per cycle right all ofthose are like key motivators but youknow some of the things that that we runinto right when you look at AWS andgoing to gcp is also aboutwhat does a tech stack look like sure itlooks very different right and so thereis this whole you know Discovery andlearning you know that obviously goeswith that well there's what's great isyou've been able to help us visualizesome of the before and after you knowthe transformation that happened to yoursystems maybe uh you know what were someof the technical opportunities yeahyeah I you know um this this particulardiagram that that you're seeing actuallytalks about the Enterprise automationthat we enabled on our platforms rightum and it's not only about Enterpriseautomation it's also about you knowoperational scale sure and automationthat's applied at operational scale umif you see the before you can actuallysee that you know we were pretty likeyou know container I mean we werecontainerized already we had our youknow applications on you know Dockerimage and whatnot right but uh managingthose at scale is not that you know easywhen you're trying to you know scale tothe workloads that we were talking aboutright so moving to you know kubernetesright and making sure we have the rightlevel of orchestration to to be able toenable that all of those are you knowsuper important to us and that's likeone example of you know place where weapplied it and this is you know oneexample of it the other places are Ithink that we have one more slide wherewe actually talk about the Enterpriseautomation right so the Enterpriseautomation here what you're going to seethe before picture is this is devopsheavy right so whenever we try to um uhhave releases right um we we wereconstrained by a number of factorsenvironments do we have environmentsthat could be leveraged forum you know having higher higherfrequency of releases right what's itwhat sort of velocity can we move withthen data is always an issue right whenyou have environments like QAenvironments Dev environments do youhave the ability to kind of you know runload tests do you have the ability torun you know things in parallel so youcan have multiple releases that aregetting ready or you can work on a patchwhile you're working on a release rightso the before picture I mean it workedfor us I mean I'm not saying it did workbut the issue was it reduced our abilityto run fast with more releases and ittook a lot from the team in terms of thelift that is required from the teams tomake things happen right well you cansee it right in there right how manyarrows go to that poor Lonesome devopsright engineer on the left that's a lotof it looks liketoil to me yeah our devops teams aresuperheroes that's right so look nowthat devops engineer has maybe got someautomation on their team that's rightright so this is what our you know likeone of our products looks like after weimplemented the Enterprise Automationand the patterns there a simple case ofyou know having environments that we canstand up and tear down and thoseenvironments are hydrated with the dataand that the fact that you actuallyhydrate these environments with dataactually enables us to do a whole lot ofthings and have that flexibility and thespeed and velocity that which we canactually ship products right and itthere's nothing worse than justdeploying the compute part and realizingthat you just haven't actually testedanything that's rightso you've expanded your footprint it'suh digital turbines built by acquisitionyou have multiple companies andinitiatives uh talk to me about singletap and bringing that into Google CloudMarketplace maybe share with theaudience how you're using Google'sMarketplace and house Auto is able tohelp yeah absolutely single tab is anenabler and it's part of our productsproduct Suite you know as I mentionedyou know we have a netbook of Partnersand these network of Partners tend to bemobile carriers and you know mobile oemsthat have adopted you know our coretechnology on on these mobile phonesright and soum what that enables us to do is buildnew types of capabilities and single tabis an example of that capability rightso first of all I'm going to just walkthe audience through you know whatsingle tab is Right single tab think ofthink of you uh you know seeing anadvertisement while you're on yourmobile phone and the the ad is for foryou know for you to play you knowfortnite right when you click that adright essentially with that one clickyou will have your you know app actuallyinstalled on the mobile phone withoutyou having to go through the friction ofgoing into you know a Store to downloadthe app right so the whole idea issingle tab enables these types ofexperiences where you go from you knowclick to conversion right where your appgets installed and once your app getsinstalled now that becomes a point foryou to monetize and do a whole bunch ofthings right so single tab is an enablerfor us and for us it is important toconnect our technology capability withmore and more you know app developersand Publishers out there and for and youknow when we were talking about singleTab and the growth of single tab one ofthe things that you know Google and Sarahelped us with was hey you know if wetake this technology and put it onGoogle marketplace is you have this youknow mechanism like an additionalchannel to grow your you know develop afootprint and the adoption of thetechnology and so that's an example ofus you know taking one of ourTechnologies and creating an additionalchannel for expanding uh adoption anduse of you know a capability that weenable right we're watching across somany of our customers just explosivegrowth of enabling isv tooling throughGoogle's Marketplace so we were justreally excited to see you added to thatrapidly growing list talk to us aboutthis before and after another comparisonof a modernization in your systems yeahI mean uh you know this is yet one moreof our product platforms and you know weactually have the uh the the the the thebrains behind this platform even sittinghere so which is great but but you knowjust as an fi right I mean so this is abefore picture right uh so when we wereon AWS there were a few things where wehad some homegrown tooling to do variousthings right and we were not on uh whatdo I call an infrastructure that enablesus to scale and have that you knowoperational scale that we wanted sureum an example here like if you if yousee this here you are actually seeingthe before picture like we had some youknow homegrown tool that we were usingfor you know continuous deployment rightand an example of lift modernize andshift is if you go into the afterpicture what you will see is westreamline that whole process right wemoved to Argo CD and so we have thiswhole process of CI CD that takes us allthe way to you know deployment on gcpand not only that you know we arealready seeing the benefits of it whichis our ability to deploy our solutionyou know much faster the velocity ismuch higher and we are able to do it youknow with not burdening our you knowdevops team constantly right so we builtthis automation that enables us to youknow just move more you know fast andefficiently as an organization rightthat's I mean every every engineer isdoing the work to try andhelp save the company money help buildthe tools that are required but the thatbuild versus by decision and findingplaces where you can springboard off ofthe Investments That Google and the isvecosystem makes and it's just a way tolet them take seriously and as theirreason to exist that natural problem youalso changed out some of the datasystems that were a part of that I'minterested in you talking through maybethe move from dynamodb yeah we didactually we moved from Dynamo DB tobigtable right we are talking aboutmassive scale here in terms of you knowour data moving from dynamodb to uh youknow a big table but in addition to thatwe moved from VMS to gke right uh we aretalking about like 8 000 you know nodeson the gke right and so this is againyou know massive scale in terms of youknow what we do and then of coursemoving away from the Homegrown you knowtool and moving to standardized opentools enables us to kind of focus onwhat we really want to be doing which isBuilding Products right right well we webrought a little surprise I wanted toput this in front of folks can anybodysquint and see what their is thattotally legible there in the back oh noprobably not so I want to be clear youknow we've talked about just really thetip of the iceberg of the nuance andcomplexity that went into this migrationthis is the actual project planning ofsome 2600 distinct steps between dozensand dozens of team members on your sideand dozens on side aside not only toarrive on overall governance of theprogram but to coordinate the educationand collaboration around refining tofinal design and then working throughthe logistics of deployment and then sunsetting of subsequent systems so it'sthis stuff is not it's not obvious righteverybody's used to one of those simplearchitecture diagrams you're going to dotwo phases and then you're done thereality is it does take the complicatedcoordinated work to run the real problemto ground uh you know I'm just superinterested what you know what part ofthis obviously easy to read plan stoodout for you is uh you know a place wherewe really work together wellumit's moving from one cloud provider toanother is is a journey right and youknow as an organization like any otherswho may also be considering that youknow you should reallyum have a strong partner going into thatJourney because you know otherwiseyou're going to be lost along the wayright and you know as we went throughthis journey there are uh you knowthere's always new discoveries and newlearnings and then we find way toquickly iterate and adapt and say okaythis is how we are going to solveproblems but specifically if I look atyou know our planum it you know there are places where Iwould say the world right there are newlearnings along the way for example youknow uh when we calculated our you knowuh the move from one platform to theother you know we run into various typesof uh what do I call uh challenges withregards to what our assumptions were andwhat it actually turned out pretty itturned out to be we had for example Sadaalong the way as we actually did thisbut on the project planning side ofthings rightthis has to be run these complexprojects have to be run as a Clockworkright with responsible parties andmaking sure that we have also theresourcing to move fast on areas wherewe get blocked right I would say the keyareas that stood out for me were likehow the teams worked together to handleum you know blockers right any time whensomething gets delayed it has afinancial implication for us just keepin mind you know as you're going throughthis journey for us the way weorchestrated it is you know we had thisdouble bubble right which means we arerunning our services on AWS while we'rebringing our power services on gcp andwe were shifting traffic right and whyit was important for us to do that is wewant zero downtime and zero impact torevenue right so if you if you don'twant any impact Revenue when you'retrying to drive that complex project youactually have to have all you know eyeson glass in terms of how that's runningand managing that you know at scale whenyou're talking about the type of scale Italked about is complex and you knowthat from a point of view of planningand mapping out all those differentpieces the cut-overs right how thetraffic ramps up what sort of costs arewe incurring because you know you wantto like scale but you want you don'twant to you know scale so much that youover provision your infrastructure soall of that right are parts and parcelof the plan and you really want to kindof hold to those plansso look I hope everybody's internalizedhow much progress this represents howdid Sada and Google togetheradvise you on this plan with regard toall the choices that you had to makeum there are multiple Dimensions to theto the uh you know I would say thatpartnership right from an advisingperspective right one isum all the math that goes into the clouddeployment costs and calculations andall that right and you know one of theresources that we had from Sada was youknow this financial Guru right and youknow he knew more than you know what weknew about the coast and the coast ofscaling and the cost of uh you knowmoving from one platform to the otherand it's a fine art right you have tojuggle your Coast across multiple Cloudproviders while you're trying to do itand you know that's one area where weheavily leaned on uh on both Sara andand Google for doing thatum then in addition to that right thereis allum all the refactoring that you're doingright and you know we are doing someheavy refactoring as we were trying toyou know modernize our application andthen technology is right I mean if youlook at AWS not everything that you haveon AWS that we had was you know how do Icall it Cloud agnostic right right wehad a number of things that were Cloudnative and you know we also wanted tolean on a partner to help us withdriving specific technology decisionsthat enabled us to kind of really tryand future proof what we're trying to donow keep in mind you know this morning'suh you know not the keynote I thoughtwas very interesting which is about youknow Legacy and you know I mean yes wehave a solid Legacy platform but when wetry to modernize it you know how it istoday's modern is tomorrow's you knowLegacy right so that's right so we triedto Future proof as much as possible andum making the right technology decisionsas we're thinking about it thinkingabout the scale and how we are going togo there those are the decisions that weheavily leaned on on Sara as well Googleawesomeso okay you did an incredible amount ofwork right I saw a gazillion steps whatwhat was the outcome how did this howdid this positively affect the businessum I would say a number of ways rightbecause one is you know I talked aboutyou know ship velocity right shivalocityrefers to our ability to quickly iteratedeploy and you know run things throughautomation right some of these wehaven't fully realized the benefits ofit right but you know we have earlyindicators that we that we are going toactually reduce some of the operationalburdens right and get to you know wherewe want to beum from a business outcome perspectivethere are things that you know thecloser partnership that we have withGoogle Drives right through Marketplaceyou know what we are seeing with youknow single Tab and what we are tryingto do there but from a technologyoutcome you know perspective right Iwould say you know we have used this asan opportunity to modernize ourapplication and that means you know thewhole uh scaling aspect of it issomething that we have figured out andthen in addition to that right one ofthe key components for us from a growthperspective is how we think aboutdata right and how we leverage the datathat we generate from our systems we arein the process of going through thisevaluation where we can leverage our newplatform capabilities to do more withdata right and do more with AI right wehaven't gone deep there yet right butthat's you know going to be a set ofoutcomes that we are excited about I Ijust can't wait uh I am telling you whatI am watching happen uh in in businessesevery day around those Technologies isso mind-blowing given your faculty withchange and your team's ability to workhard on pursuit of innovation I thinkyou're set up to do totally incrediblestuff so uh maybe learnings takeawaysfor our audience how what should they uhincorporate as they anticipate their ownmigration yeah I would say uh you knowfirst step really understand thethe whole impact that you're going tohave as you're going through thisprocess rightum what I mean by impact is you know itis it is uh it is going to be a veryinvolved exercise as you are going tomove from one Cloud prior to the otherand it will have some impact on yourroadmap and your ability to deliver youknow specific features and buildingspecific products so having a strongpartner in the process right that willhelp augment and help accelerate is is avery key component of this right sothat's for from for for us you know howdo you like really tune the knob withregards to how much you want the partnerto do versus how much you want you knowour Engineers to do it's always a finebalance right because keep in mind whenwe're in production you want yourengineers to be able to you know take itand run it right and so you have tomaintain that balance the second is youknow just learnings around technologychoices right having knowledgeableparties that can actually guide you andhelp you through the you know technologydecisions that you're making as you'reon this journey is important becauseit's going to set you up for Success youknow in the future rightum and then you know overallum this takescertain amount of you know how do I callitprogram management across the boardright with your partners but also withinternally within the organization andculturally you have to create thatawareness culturally you have to likeyou know our your teams have to feelthat they are empowered right on thisjourney right because at the tail end ofthe journey your teams are going to bemoving from one cloud provider toanother so you have to help your teamsget up leveled that education thatawareness you know being ready to kindof operate at scale are all importantright as you're thinking through thischannelwell look I I really appreciate the thepraise and the positive feedback it isit is impossible to drive these kinds ofoutcomes with customers that are notready to change that aren't are notinvested in the potential that Googleand the broader technologies that we'reworking on present I thought your teamsdid an absolutely outstanding job ofwrapping their arms around found thatvision of what was possible and seeingthe results from that work has been verygratifying it's an important part of whywe do what we do so thank you for thepartnership yeah no absolutely and andthere are certain things that you knowas we were building the platform wetried to build those constructs thefundamentals right you know one simpleexample is security right rather thanyou know the reactive nature that wewere going through what when wemodernize can we do at the core of theplatform so that is standardized acrossthe board right that's one example of itright but you know those are things thathelps immensely yeah no I mean I thinkhaving having the business coordinatedaround especially a business built byacquisition with so many differentdivisions getting to program and patternconsistency really pays dividends foryou more than many others I suspect welllook I I want to thank you for ouraudience uh and thank you in theaudience for uh or listening throughCynthia's incredible story The Journeycontinues that flow chart doesn't stopat the end we've got we've got a lotmore left to do I'm just really excitedfor what we're going to be able toaccomplish together likewise you knowvery excited about this journey withSada and Googleforeign"
