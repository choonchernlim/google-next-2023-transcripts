off with a quick intromy name is Omar elastan hi everyone myname is Will Silverstone and we're bothpart of the Mandate securitytransformation Services team where wespend about 50 percent of our timeperforming incident response remediationwhich entails that we go in to containposture and eradicate threat actors fromon-prem and Cloud environments duringcyber incidents the other fifty percentof our time we spend it performingproactive engagements such as cloud andon-prem security assessmentsso we'll get into kind of a high levelagenda of what we'll cover off on heretoday we'll break the session into kindof three areas of focus that we'reseeing attackers take advantage of as itrelates to Cloud compromiseuh and for each of those we'll kind ofanchor around some incident responsecase studies and examples that our teamhas responded toand then we'll go into some technicaland tactical takeaways andrecommendations that hopefully teams canuse to help secure their environmentso we use this stat to kind of set thestagegiven that when we talk about Cloudcompromise we don't want to just talkabout cloud in isolationso 99 of organizations are running somesort of hybrid infrastructure beingcloud and on-premat the same time 63 percent oforganizationsare using either they're exactly thesame or most of the same approach forprotecting their Cloud environment asthey are for on-premand so that's kind of how we want tofocus the session here today in that wedon't want to just treat Cloud Securityin a silo but we don't want to just liftand shift copy and paste our securityapproach from on-prem to Cloudand so our security approach when wethink about protecting against Cloudcompromise should account for the factthat we that lines between on-premiseand Cloud are blurred and overlappingand interconnectedthat there's an increasing importance ofprotecting identities in that identitiesare kind of that security boundary forcloud environments and that there's a 10extended attack surface that includescloud and includes on-prem and kind ofeverything in betweenwe wanted to bring the Frontlineexperience of how we see threat actorsabuse and compromise Cloud environmentsin summary we broke it down into threemain pillars or themespillar one understanding your hybridarchitecture throughout that pillarwe'll touch on how threat actors abusehybrid Integrations and connectivity togain access to Cloud environmentspillar number two securing youridentities where we'll coverand touch on Common Thread actorexploitsaround weak identity controls and we'llalso touch on common overlooked aspectsto both identity as well as multi-factorAuthenticationand lastly we'll talk through reducingyour attack surface and in that pillarwe'll touch on why we need to change thenarrative to look at our attack surfacenot just from a network perspective butalso to Encompass identity more to comeon thatthrow out all three pillars we'll touchon the importance of effective loggingdetection and responsewe'll go through and mention casestudies we'll go through IR examples andI want to spend 30 seconds to give anoverview of how we at mandate track andcategorize threat actors we break themdown and put them in one of threebuckets bucket one is apt which standsfor advanced persistent threat actorsthose are nation state sponsor threatactors and oftentimes highly technicalin nature bucket 2 fin or financiallymotivated threat actors those are threatactors or financial motivesand bucket 3 is uncategorized meaningthose are threat actors that we'retracking but they still haven'tgraduated to either Finn or apt it's avery long and complex process tograduate threat actorsthroughout this session will referencethreat actors by saying talastly before we dig into our firstpillar we'll go through case studies andIR examples we we modified some of thefacts to protect our clients as well asor individuals associated with ourclients and with that I'll hand it overto will to cover our first pillarunderstanding your hybrid architecturethat's good cool so we'll get into thefirst area of focus here arounduh hybrid architecture and so we'llstart off with some you know Commonchallenges uh in context of kind ofprotecting that hybrid environment andso you know starting off onmisconfiguring tier zero within Cloudenvironments and so what we mean by thisis on our incident response engagementson our proactive assessments we'reseeing our organizations deploying thatkind of tier zero criticalinfrastructure within their Cloudenvironments think active directorydomain controllers pki servers Pamservers within their cloudand so when you deploy that criticalinfrastructure that can control youron-premise environment into your Cloudenvironment the security of youron-premise and the security or Cloudenvironments are now tied to one anotherand so a misconfiguration in the cloudcan endanger the security of youron-premise environment and vice versa acompromise on-prem can lead to acompromise in the cloudand so that kind of gets into the secondPoint around accounting for privilegeescalation and lateral movement betweeneach environment in that an attackercompromising in one environment can usethat to move into the other environmentand then lastly making sure that we'reaccounting for the control plane versusthe data plane as it relates to Cloudenvironments and so what we mean by thisis uh specifically for cloud you knowcontrol plane being the administrativefunction the console the apis to createupdate delete resources the data planebeing kind of the running infrastructureitself you know a running process on aVM a local admin on a database somethinglike thatand so as security teamsdeploying that infrastructure withinCloud environments we need to thinkabout protecting access protecting dataabout the control plane and the dataplane and so we'll get into an exampleof thatso this is kind of a typical Cloudresource hierarchy you know you have gcpfolders you have Azure management groupsyou have AWS organizations within thatprojects subscriptions accounts and thenwithin that you have the you knowinfrastructure itselfand so what we're seeing is you knoworganizations deploying domaincontrollers pki servers that tier zeroinfrastructure Down Here Withoutnecessarily thinking about whatpermissions or security controls havebeen applied at higher levels withinthat hierarchyan example within gcp would be you knowa domain controller running as a virtualmachine within a specific project and ifyou have a you know Cloud administratoraccount that's assigned the computeinstance admin role within that projector within a folder that's inherited downthat cloud administrator now has theability to reset passwords on thatdomain controller create localadministrator accounts on that domaincontroller so if that cloudadministrator account is compromisedthere's a clear path to be able tocompromise the on-premise environment aswellthat would be kind of a way for anattacker to take advantage of thecontrol plane versus data plane andCloud environment to move throughon-prem next we'll get intoour firstincident response case study here thatkind of shows the reverse where we hadan on-premise compromise that ended upleading to ransomware within the cloudand so we saw here was you know startingoff an attacker was able to exploit uhexchange vulnerability and exfiltrateemails from The on-premise Exchange andthey actually ended up selling thoseemails to a second threat group who isthen able to use that to craft kind ofhardly targeted phishing campaignsagainst usersand because those emails were comingfrom you know the data was coming fromemails from within the organization anumber of users ended up falling forthose phishing campaign the attacker wasable to compromise a series ofadministrator accounts get onto thenetwork move laterally to a domaincontrollerfrom there they had access to deploy youknow Group Policy object GPO to you knowdeploy ransomware across the domain andfor this specific organization they hadvirtual machines running in their Cloudenvironment that were domain joined andso there was nothing stopping theransomware deployment from spreadingfrom the on-premise environment into thecloud environmentand so when we think about kind ofransomware in the cloud this is one ofthe more common models in terms of anon-premise compromise leading to youknow compromise within the cloudso we'll get into some takeaways fromthisuh two pieces to that kind of thesecurity interior infrastructure andproperly segmentingcloud and on-premso you know first off like we talkedabout considering that permissionsinheritance considering the inheritanceof you know security controls and kindof having the full inventory and pictureof who has access to what at each levelwithin that in Cloud hierarchyand so one way to control that would bearound the second bullet to deploy thatkind of critical infrastructure within adedicated Management Group within Azurea dedicated gcp folder to kind of reducewhat would get inherited down within andkind of isolate that those componentsand so if you're using something like atiering model on premise within sayactive directory making sure that's alsoreflected within your Cloud environmentas well be it you know stricter accesscontrols or more granular logging stufflike thatthe second Point around properlysegmenting on-prem and Cloud really themain takeaway here is traditionalsecurity best practices from on-premiseenvironments still apply within thecloud you know limiting outboundconnections from virtual machines uhusing you know security groups withinAWS gcp firewall things like thatand then the last Point around thatprivilege escalation lateral movementand so really understanding if you'reresponsible for securing a cloudenvironmentinventory and understanding what arethose weaknesses within on-prem that canthen lead to compromise within my cloudenvironmentand then last kind of takeaway with thissection would be logging and detectionprioritiesyou know starting off with control planeaudit logs making sure that you havekind of the picture of theadministration of the cloud environmentuh cloudtrail logs audit logs activitylogs things like that these aregenerally enabled by by default and thereason we bring that up is when we talkabout that data plane logging you knowlogs for activity in and on a specificresource within the cloud these are theones that generally need to be enabledand configuredand so when we do our you know incidentresponse investigations a lot of thetime we see logs that are required to doa full investigation haven't necessarilybeen enabled and configured andcentralizedlastly around kind of correlationopportunities between control plane dataplane and the cloud but also thaton-premise component as well and so ifwe end up in an incident responsescenario that has an on-prem componentand a cloud component do we have theability to you know collect those logscentralize those logs but also alert anddetect on you know movement between eachenvironmentand so with that I'll pass it back overto Omar for the secure identitiesportion awesome thank you well before Idig into the identity pillar I'd like tobring up an interesting statisticwithin q1 of 2023 more than 60 percentof cloud compromises originated fromsome sort of an identity compromisesuch as a brute force of an account withweak or no passwordphishing attacks or leaked credentialsso from the front line perspective whatare the common challenges that we see asit relates to Identityone lack of tiering and separation weoften see organizations using theiron-prem IDP commonly active directory toadminister and manage their on-premenvironment as well as their Cloudenvironment and oftentimes that activedirectory environment is based on Legacyarchitecture and setup essentially aflat domainwhat that creates is a massive riskVector where now identities that arebased on on-prem active directory oncean if compromised attackers are able touse those same credentials to log intoCloud directlythe second challenge that I want tobring upcovers an excessive scope of privilegedidentitiesa lot of organizations have moved fastto Cloud have migrated a lot ofworkloads and they defaulted to usingthe default roles across the cloudservice providersoftentimes we see organizations handingover highly privileged roles that aredefault to their infrastructure as wellas to the developer teams in AWS we seethem handing over the administrator rolein Azure we see them handing over theglobal admin role and in gcp we see themuse basic rules such as editor forexampleeditor is an interesting role where ifyou look at the permissions associatedwith that role you'll see it has morethan 4 000 overlapping permissionsand the third challenge I want tomention covers multi-factorauthentication it's not just the MFAmethod that we're enforcing the areathat oftentimes or organizationsOverlook is the operational aspect ofMFA from where my users can registerdeviceshow many devices can a single user havefor examplewe'll touch on those throughout our IRstudies let's let's start with our firstIR case study under this pillarattacking daily driver account in thisirk study we're dealing with an aptthreat actor reminder apt those arehighly technical in nature and what wesaw here is that threat actor usingcredentialsstolen credentials to log into a singleFactor VPN once they access the VPN theystarted moving laterally on-prem withinthe on-prem network and as they wereprogressing and accessing differentsystems they were installing rats orremote access tools this is a commonattack technique that we see threatactors use to maintain Persistence ofwithin an environmenteventually they were able to get to adomain controller and once they got to adomain controller they dumped andexfiltrated the active directorydatabase also known as the ntds.ditwhat's interesting over here is thatthreat actor once they exfiltrated thentds they came back within 24 hoursusing the accounts that they havecompromised from the ntds or the activedirectory database and they use thoseaccounts to log in directly into Azureadand the account that they used hadGlobal administrator role within Azureadonce they got into Azure ad the nextlogical step was to perform Reconunderstand the lay of the landunderstand the different securitysettings within the Orcs tenantthey started modifying certain settingsand eventually they were able tocomplete their mission which is theexfiltration of Highly privileged datasetso what are the key takeaways from thisIR case studyone the use of distinct and segregatedidentities for administrative functionsespecially when it comes to CloudCloud administrators should be usingCloud only accounts that are not managedand not synced to on-prem activedirectory or on-prem IDPadministrator accounts should bedistinct and separate from the dailydriver account meaning the daily driverthat every end user uses to log intoemail to conduct their day-to-day jobadministrator accounts should only beused to perform administrative functionsin additionimplementing just-in-time check-incheckout enforcement model with accessapproval requirement what that means isthat with a just-in-time access Model Aprivileged account is only privilegedfor a finite duration of time only whenthey need to perform administrativefunctions of hours on weekends onholidays that account would no longer beadministrativeor would not have any privileged rolesadditionally some cloud serviceproviders across the board offer somesort of a privileged identity managementthat offers that capability but we'vealso seen organizations deploy asuccessfully a privileged accessmanagement or a Pam solution for shortthat offers that same functionalitythe third takeaway I want to touch on isthe use of privileged access Workstationthe use of a privileged access stationwould allow the organization to restrictaccess to Cloud add to Cloud consoles aswell as admin portalsthe benefit of a paw is that itintroduces a barrier between youreveryday endpoints using beingcompromised and administrative endpointsa successfully implemented par would besegmented isolated with limited accessto the internetone key benefit I want to bring to thetable what does it relate to Paul isthat if you restrict access to Cloud toand from cloud consoles as welladministrative portals and an attackeris able to compromise a privilegedidentity they would also have tocompromise the privileged accessworkstation in order to be able tosuccessfully authenticate and log in toa cloud console or an admin portaland lastly the use of some sort of amulti-admin approval capability amulti-admin approval capability wouldprevent one admin from conductingmassive changes within an infrastructureor within an admin portal one admin caninitiate or request the change but ithas to be approved by a secondary adminwe're seeing right now that vendors aswell as cloud service providers areoffering some sort of a multi-adminapproval functionality but even if thevendor or cloud cloud provider does notoffer that functionality you couldimplement this using roles across themajor cloud service providersokay so we talked about identity wetalked about weak identity controls andhousehold actors abuse it now let'sshift gears and talk through MFA there'sa lot of MFA methods there's a lot ofattack techniques against MFA but let'stouch on the most common two MFA attacktechniquesfirst and foremost is MFA fatigue whichtargets primarily MFA push notificationas a method where this attack techniqueis commonly used by all threat actors ongroups apt as well as Finn where we seethem Target users and send the userwithin a short span of time so let's say50 MFA requests on their phone within aspan of two minutesthreat actors aregoing through that attack path becausethey're exploiting the user'sfrustration as well as their desire tostop receiving notifications on theirphoneusers especially non-technical users orfolks within cyber space end upaccepting MFA requests granting thethreat actor accessagain very very common attack techniqueconducted by most threat actorsthe second MFA attack technique that wesee through actors use is adversary inthe middle or aitm for shortthat one is more interesting because wesee threat actors registered domainsthat look like the organization domainwith a small difference for example theorganization.sso.comthey then use those domainssend it out to users in a linkthat can be through email that can bethrough SMS and once the user clicks onthat linkit sends them to a login portal where auser would enter their username theirpassword go through the MFA Challengeand once they follow that successfullyall that data set goes back to thethreat actors infrastructure allowingthem access and allowing them even worseto register their own MFA methodokay so we talked about common MFAattack techniquesnow let's talk through the differentcommonly used MFA methods out therethe most common MFA methods we seeorganizations use are email SMS phonecall or push notification those are theeasiest MFA methods to scale to deployacross your end users however from asecurity perspective those MFA methodsare vulnerable to most MFA attacktechniques such as Sim swap phishing oradversary in the middlewe saw vendors pushing towards moresecure MFA method and that's where wesaw the introduction of totp ortime-based one-time password MFA where auser would have an MFA application ontheir phone they would log into itthere's an MFA code that getsregenerated every 60 seconds for examplemuch much more secure MFA method thanthe first batch however with successfulphishing and social engineering attackswe're seeing end users fall for itand providing threat actor the MFA codeso we now have context matching ornumber matching which providesadditional data set to allow the user todetermine the legitimacy of the MFAprompt on their phone additional dataset can be the login IP address thelocation where the login is attemptingfrom or even the application the user isattempting to accessyet again with successful socialengineering users do fall for itso what MFA method is secure providesadditional layer of protection and isand is resilient against the common MFAmethod attack techniques there's ahandful of fishing resistant MFA methodsthe one I want to emphasize is 502Hardware keys Fido is a much more secureMFA method it offers enhanced securityand is resilient to the common MFAattack techniques that we walk throughso farsaying that the key caveat with Fido isthat rolling out Fido at scale becomesmuch more difficult given that you haveto physically ship Hardware keys to yourend usersso how can we protect our MFAinfrastructure holistically let's talkthrough some takeawaysone enforcing fishing resistant MFA forall users yet again we just talked abouthow difficult it is given that you haveto ship the hardware keys to your endusers at a bare minimum enforcing Fidoor phishing resistant MFA for highlyprivileged users as well as your highvalue targetstwo restricting the MFA enrollmentprocesswhereas for end users to register or addan MFA method they have to be physicallylocated within a trusted Networklocation your corporate office forexample and if that's not feasible orscalable then the second option can bethat they have to call the help desk gothrough a video verification processshow their face show their ID and oncethey pass that verification processthey're allowed to register a new MFAmethodany changes to MFA should be recordedshould be logged and should be reacteduponthat that encompasses MFA additionsremovals and any modificationsand lastly this last bullet point hitson the endpoints themselves not theirmobile devices whereas an endpoints wewant to add additional constraints toprotect against session relay attackswhere we see threat actors compromisingan endpoint stealing the tokens on thatendpoint and using them on theirinfrastructure to gain access toresourcesto protect against that we want torestrict devices accessing resources andapplications and admin consoles so thatthey have to be in compliant with theorganizational policies meaning theyhave your security stack they have yourEDR tools two they're joined to yourdomain and lastly we restrict thelivelihood of the session token so thateven if the token is stolen it wouldonly be valid for X number of hours ordays and not the default setting whichin some cases can be more than 90 daysand with that I'll hand it over to willto go through the last pillar reducingyour attack surfaceall right awesomeum awesome so we'll get into reduce yourattack surface starting off similar tothe other pillars with some commonchallenges uh and so when we talk aboutyou know tax surface in the cloud Ithink the one thing we want to focus onhere is making sure that you have theability to see your own environment asattackers can externallyand so one common challenge that we seeorganizations face is that attacksurface isn't necessarily just Networkfocused when we talk about the cloudthat being said publicly exposedresources are still a very common commoncause of cloud compromise and we'll getinto some examples in the IR casestudies of how these are you know stilloccurringthe second piece is kind of around youknow tenant enumeration in that attacksurface can also include what anattacker can enumerate about yourenvironment things like the identitiesthat exist within it securityconfiguration settings resourceconfigurations things like thatand then lastly we're including keys andcredentials as part of the attacksurface you know like long-lived serviceaccount Keys user credentials that canbe mistakenly published to public coderepositories upload it to SharePointuploaded to Google Drive you know otherinsecure locations like that and sowe'll go through another IR example thatcovers those credentials as welland so we'll break down each of thosethat we just talked about starting offwith publicly exposed resourcesand so when we think about Cloudcompromise this is probably the one thatmakes the most headlines over the yearsin terms of you know public S3 bucket apublic storage account that gets anattacker is able to identify thatexfiltrate data from that organizationand so Cloud providers have done a lotto make it more difficult toinadvertently expose these to the publicbut we're still seeing this you know asa common challenge worth bringing uphere both from the perspective of thatinfrastructure as a service usuallyvirtual machines that are you knowexposed from a network perspective andalso from the platform as a servicethose storage accounts database ServicesAPI endpoints that with sometimes youknow one misconfiguration one settingcan be exposed to the internetuh and so we'll get into another IRexample that kind of goes through howthese you know continue to occurin this case we had an organizationlooking to set up a sensitive buildserver within their Cloud environment asa virtual machine and so given thesensitivity of that virtual machine theywanted to put it behind a reverse proxythat only accepted connections fromtheir on-premise data center so it'sgreat it's not exposed to the Internetit's only accepting connections fromknown IPS at the same time as they'resetting it up they also attached anelastic IP not a huge deal because asyou can see in the security groupassociated with it still only acceptingconnections from that reverse proxywhich is only accepting connections fromthe on-premise data centernow in a story I'm sure a lot of peoplehave seen before during the course oftesting and administrators working fromhome and wants to access that buildserver so they update the security groupjust temporarily in this case to allowaccess from the internet and bypass thatreverse proxy that's out in frontand so like we talked about you knowattackers are continuously scanning forvirtual machines that are exposed to theinternet in this case this one isaccessible from the internet has apublic IP associated with it and so infact are over the course of a few dayswas able to identify this virtualmachine brute force their way onto itand eventually access the sensitive datacredentials that were on this VM andthen eventually extort this specificorganizationand so we'll kind of talked through youknow there's tools that are availableboth that we see attackers takingadvantage of and also you know ourinternal red teams that can help toidentify this attack surface both fromthe perspective of public exposureacross the three you know major Cloudproviders virtual machines that areexposed platform as a serviceinfrastructure that's exposed differenttools that can do that but also from theperspective of if an attacker hasread-only or low privileged accesswithin your Cloud environment there'stools available to enumerate data aboutthat tenant enumerate credentials thatmight live within the cloud environmentas a way for the attacker to identifythose and then be able to escalateprivilegesto really you know making sure that youhave using the tools have thatperspective of what an attacker can seeexternallyfrom your environmentand so Cloud security posture managementgreat way to help out with that in termsof it has a lot of really valuablecomponents to it we're talking aboutCloud security for this one specificallywe're thinking more from the inventoryperspective in terms of identifying whatshould be publicly exposed and thenbeing able to alert and remediateanything that gets inadvertently so ifwe talk about that IR examplesetting that Security Group to allowaccess from the internet sort ofimmediately set off alarm Bells had anincident response process associatedwith it to go and remediate thatanother great way to help identify thosekind of x externally exposed resourcesfrom a network perspective would besomething like an external attacksurface management scanning tool youknow giving a set of public IP addressesbeing able to identify you know whatresources are available what software isrunning on them any vulnerabilitiesassociated with those and kind of getthe idea of any entry points into theenvironmentso those are kind of the network aspectthe last two are a little bit differentin terms of monitoring social media anddark web for kind of targeted keywordsabout your organization things like youknow chatter on the dark web about usercredentials that have been compromiseddata that's been compromised potentialvulnerabilities and also like Omarmentioned you know domain registrationsthat are similar to your organizationand kind of having a process to identifythose and have a takedown process forthose domains as welland then lastly proactively scanning forcredentials that may live in coderepositories or file shares places likethat but also within Cloud environmentsitself and so think like functionvariables could have secrets andcredentials that live with them uhinfrastructure is code templates startupscripts for virtual machines all theseplaces that if an attacker is able toget low privileged or read-only accesswithin your Cloud environment they'llstart you know scanning for andidentifying these credentials that canlive as a way to escalate privilegesso on that point of credential scanningwe'll get into thelast IR example around a service accountcredential leakingleading to crypto miningso in this case we had a gcp serviceaccount that was created with ownerpermissions so right off the bat youknow over privileged we know some of thetakeaways from thatthis credential associated with thatservice account was inadvertentlyuploaded to a public code Repositoryand for this organization actuallywithin gcp they had security CommandCenter running and actually identifiedthat that service account key had beenuploaded to a public code repositorythey received an alert it said you knowthis credential for this service accountbut these privileges has been uploadedto this code repository go take it downunfortunately for this organization theywere not actively monitoring thesealerts from their out-of-the-box toolsand so this one went unnoticed for anumber of daysand So eventually an attacker was ableto identify this credential enumeratewhat they had access to realize they hadthe ability to spin up new virtualmachines and so they did that acrossnumber of regions set up internetconnectivity and then were able todeploy that crypto mining software uhacross you know the gcp projectswhat did eventually tip off thisorganization was not the alerts from theout-of-box tools but it was the costanomaly and the the billing associatedwith that projectsowe'll get into some takeaways to finishout this sectionmore around protecting service accountsand those credentials so really reducingthe need and identifying where possiblewe can move from those long-livedservice account credentials and movingtowards you know short-term credentialsthings like AWS using roles instead ofIEM users gcp using workload identityFederation instead of service accountsAzure using managed identities insteadof service principles things like thatif still required you know having thoseservice accounts make sure that there'san inventory and audit of how they'rebeing used uh you know things like who'sthe owner of that service account whatdoes the service account do what are thedependencies if it is compromised and wehave to go and rotate it making surethat that's documented in either withinthe cloud provider or you knowexternally somewherethird area around you know Liberty andthe scope of service accounts so youknow the service account shouldn't haveowner permissions assigned to it butreally just kind of using the tools areavailable to identify which permissionsare required for those accounts and thenyou know applying those as required andobviously this one's kind of easier saidthan done but we do see it provide a lotof value as it relates to those incidentresponse examplesand then lastly make sure we'remonitoring those you know out of the boxtools and developing you know customdetections if possible to be able toidentify anomalous usage of our serviceaccounts and user credentials thingslike that and then having a process toidentify thosetake those alerts and then have aresponse plan and Playbook to go andremediate those using the informationthat we talked about on those firstthreeawesome and so with that I'll pass itback over to Omar to wrap us upthank youall right folks let's wrap upokay so we talked about three mainpillars or themes one is securing yourhybrid architecture understanding yourIntegrations between on-prem and Cloudenvironments and how attackers can abusethose Integrations to compromise andabuse your Cloud environments tosegmenting and securing your identitiesand accounts I accounts are not createdequal so should the security enforcementthat we have on accountsand lastly the third one on attacksurface every organization should haveThe High Ground comparative threat actorgiven that you should know yourinfrastructure and your identitiesbetter than a threat actorexpanding your attack surface scope toEncompass identity and not just Networkwill give you a better understanding ofwhat could occur or what could anon-privileged user view across yourinfrastructure and across yourenvironmentthroughout this session we presentedincidents in a linear approach I want toreiterate and bring up that incidentsare not linear they're much more dynamicin nature and Encompass multiple levelsacross your infrastructure and acrossyour organizationyour security program and initiativesshould comprehensively Encompass on-premCloud environments and every integrationin between and with that thank you alland thanks for joining usthank you"
