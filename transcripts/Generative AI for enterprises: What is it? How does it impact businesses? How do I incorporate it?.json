    "transcript": "foreign[Music]hello everybody Welcome to today'ssession around generative AI we're goingto be talking about what it is and howto incorporate it for your business myname is Brianna Brown I'll be moderatingthe conversation today I'm joined bythree incredibly talented individuals inthe industry Ben Kessler president of 66degrees Clive de Souza head of partnerengineering at Google cloud and Mattkelberman VP of data analytics at 66degreesfirst off thank you all for joining thisconversation I think there are about ahundred sessions around AI specificallygenerative AI so thank you all of youfor choosing to join us today we reallyappreciate itI should view the opportunity tointroduce yourself more formally and asyou do so if you could answer my firstquestion what was the first prompt thatyou put into bardBenoh my goshummy uh my wife and I have four kids anduh We've we've loved using Bard for isactually creating supplemental coursematerialfor our for our kids and you know to tohelp them Shore up any weaknessesand then ultimately you know overperform in particular areas as well andwhat I've been really impressed with isthat you know you can you can train Bardfirst saying hey help my help my thirdgrader you know Shore up some mathproblems and give us some math problemsthat she can work on to to you know toto to level up to the rest of her classand it's been frankly it's been it'sbeen really impressive and it's helpedher it's caused a big impact in her lifeokayum mine is not as deep as you are so soI have two teenagers myself I apologiesfor the wife and Folks by the way soaboutsix weeks ago or maybe give or takethere's this artist called Taylor Swiftright and she had this concert inSeattle and the tickets were superexpensive I literally had Bob say giveme the best time window where I can goand buy the tickets for my two kids uhso not as fancy as yours but it actuallygave me some suggestions that if youlook at you know this specific time thisspecific day you'll have a better luckit kind of worked out okay did you go Itook my sonmy name is Matt kelberman the first timethat I used Bard uh my my sister'sdaughter loves the beach and frequentlymakes them drive over an hour I'm fromOrlando Florida frequently makes usdrive out to the beach but we'll getthere and she's absolutely terrified tostep foot on the beach because she'safraid of the Pokey shells if you go tothe beach with the sharp shells so I Igrabbed some of the shells from the sandput in a little bottle and uh for abirthday present and you know made a alittle poem using barge around Pokeyshells at the beach that's awesomethat's cool yeah wonderfulum well as we talk about Bard and gen AIthere's a lot of hype as we all know itreminds me of the hype that we sawaround blockchain and nfts I'd love tohear from any of you what is so specialabout gen Ai and won't fizzle out likeany of the other fads we've seenpreviouslyum that's that's lying foodumlook I've been in the industryapproaching 25-27 years I sawwhen internet came I saw when the wholeconstruct of mobile phones came in andbecame an extension of us and itfundamentally changed the user Behaviornow and I can go speak on and on thegenerative AI in and of itself is anextremely extremely powerful tool it'snot a service it's not just one offeringit touches every segment and if you lookat how the engagements are going to benot just the citizen developers or thedata scientists or the customer supportor the end user everything across theboard will get impacted right whatpeople are finally realizing if you goback and look at it people should alwayssay data is King data is your currencyand there are many adjectives to thatbut the reality is to be able to go getthat data and get those actionableinsights not by just looking at onesingle unimodal constructHas Come Todaywe can now get the insights or theinputs from multi-modalities and you canactually go and drive actionableinsights you know we have examplesThomas talked about it we actually aPharma company which took the data frommultiple clinical studies and actuallydid a drug discovery which is 88 closeto reality that's vague it's not anothernft slash Bitcoin right so this is notgoing away you know we have developerswho are using it with Corey and theyliterally say that this is pairedprogramming in real lifeI have a buddy who sits and makes surethat when I'm deploying a VM I'mdeploying an operating system instance Idon't have to worry that is thiscompliant is it secure it's taken careof for me and it's done in real time sothese are the instances you know acrossthe Spectrum we are seeing them gettingmore and more integrated this willbecome ubiquitous right it's a matter oftimeyeah Clive I I love where you're you'reheaded with this is I I think about thisquestion in a with a few differentframes and is if you've hit on is is theend usersthe the use casesand then ultimately the impact and I Ithink about as you think aboutblockchain from an end user standpointor a user standpoint it's it's reallyfrankly people in I.T or people infinance that are are really it's a it'sa point solution directed at those usergroups and then in in use cases I wouldsay it's it's not as broad certainly asgen AI it's it's more narrow you knowparticularly there's a number ofhealthcare use cases or there's a numberof Finance financial services use casesthat I can think ofbut then if you look at the the Gen AIin comparisonyou think about you know those threedifferent areas from an end userstandpoint a use case and an impactend users is it's really it's everybodyfrankly it's uh you know for for thoseof us that have used Bard and hopefullyeverybody in the in the room it it'smade for the CEOit's made for the I.T person it's madefor the customer service rep it's madefor the sales person you know it's madefor a young person I think that theability and the reach of this is reallyfrom from an end user and then and thenthe use cases just to just to thinkabout the industries and then the jobfunctions that this impacts it's notjust a a finance and a health caresolution it's a ultimately we're seeinguse cases at 66 degrees in retail andconsumer and business services acrossall different kinds of functions andwe're we're seeing functions you knowsales and marketing customer success youknow r d we're seeing use cases but thenand you just think about you and you hiton this class it's the impact that thisis creating and I I would argue a fewdifferent impacts is you know it'shelping companies Revenue drive driverevenue and change customer experiencecertainly is helping become more reallymore efficient from a business processstandpoint and I think what what to meis the most exciting part is it'simpacting our productivity is that it'syou know the the impact of of Matt orClive or Ben or Brianna is 10x becauseof that gen AI which is which is to mejust frankly just to me that thatcreates staying power yeah I'd love tohear from many of you and Cliveespecially we've had the privilege ofworking really closely with you at 66 onall of the Gen AI activities we're doingwhat makes any of you the most excitedand specifically the position that 66 isin to win with generative AIumlook at the end of the day and on anaverage I talked to between 15 and 20 CXwas a monthand across the entire Spectrum binMarket Enterprise and you name thefortune 5000 if you will generative AIin and of itself is a board-leveldiscussion it's no longera technology thing it is something wherepeople don't leave withthese skills that you need for this it'sit's it's very unique you need acombination of you gotta be a devopsengineer you got to be a data scientistyou got to be an analytics engineer yougot to have the infrastructure mindsetand majority of the large Enterprisesjust don't have the skill in-house we'veseen thatthe second thing is the speed of whichis moving right the ability to rescaleupscale from a pure strategy todeploymentif you don't get behind this in the next30 16 90 days you're behind you'rebehind competition right and lastly weare saying in as is with with any largetechnologyit's not about just the technology andof itself it's the the the strategy youlay down the vision you lay down forwhat use case would like Matt wasalluding to and how the end value willbe realized by the business units simplethings like having a data strategypeople talk about governance andcompliance and and there is security ofcourse and you every so the firstquestion they ask me is is my datasecure with this technology you knowwhat is the stack doing is there aningestion and Ingress and egress of datathose conversations are front and centerwe have and partners have done thatreally well but we also realize that thedata siloing which is essentially whathappens when you get overtly secure andstart blogging and defeats the purposeof gen AI you want to be able to spareit and Chennai is a team sport peopleit's not the product marketing will doits own thing and product developmentwill do somethingso where we are seeing Partners such as66 or The Wider ecosystem they have thatwide lens and the industry doesn'tnobody doesn't know so when you havethat skill set going deep and havingthat wide lens this is where the impactmuseum is going to happen yeahyeah I think uh you know what stands outto me is actually that it empowers theend user like no application no AIapplication ever before uh you know youas a user can just jump on gotta have aGoogle account but you jump on and youcan immediately start getting insightsgetting feedback having a conversationwith this technology I think anotherreally important uh critical thingthat's important about what it'sbringing to us is a focus on datacuration data curation is is more thanjust you know the thedata Lake trend of storing as much dataas you can possibly fit into the cloudright data curation is being intentionalwith the information that you're usingbeing able to train these models withthat informationand really even refine it right if youthink about think about an artist uh youknow you have to have the appropriatecolors on a palette to create amasterpiece right that's that's reallykind of true for you know thesespecialized models as you start to getinto it in order for the AI to createtheir Masterpiece it's the foundationthat helps provide the appropriatecontext it's the foundation that helpsprovide accuracy and really helps giveit that human-like interaction uh youknow that's so valuable to usum a final thing that I really amexcited about is the focus that itallows us to bring back to you knowtraditional Ai and ml you know I thinkdifferent use cases that pop up ifknowledge search is a really common oneyou've probably heard a lot about ittoday and the rest of the week withknowledge search a lot of anorganization's knowledge is locked upand you know what what we consider darkdata you know it's unstructuredinformation stored in picturesphotocopies of licenses documents pilesof it rightit's not an uphill bat you know theseorganizations they've been storing itthis way for a long time and they'vefound no reason to change right but it'snot an uphill battle now with thegenerative AI use cases that they'retrying to accomplish to say hey usesomething like documentary AI you knowto bring structure to that informationso you can build those insights that youhave that curated data to provide aseither context or training for thesetoolsyeahuh Ben I'd love to hear your perspectiveas well you've been really successful inleading technology companies and now aservices company for others in the roomwho are in a similar role to yourselfwhat considerations do we need to thinkabout when incorporating generativecapabilitiesit's a great a great question Brianna umI would say we we should consider and wehad 66 degrees and help our clientsconsider a few different areasumI think the first is really a a datamodernization strategyMatt had done this so so clearly in inhis point isClive shared that gen AI you know in amatter of months you think about youknow some of the initial tools came outin you know November of last year youknow Q3 Q4 of last year and they'vealready made tremendous advancesin order to take advantage of this whatwe're seeing is that you have tomodernize your data infrastructure andyou have to prepare your data so thatyou can fully take advantage of theselarge language models and and at the endof the day now is the time to takeadvantage of that you know again we'restill in the early Innings here of of AIgenerative AI but in order to tomodernize your infrastructure stackin particular your data stack andfrankly Google Cloud gives you a greatopportunity to do that you know bring ina partner you know have have a dataengineering team Focus right now of howdo you structure your data clean up yourdata so that you can take advantage ofthat moving forwardyou know once your data is structuredand once you're you're on the road todata modernization I think what's reallyimportant is to is to think aboutreally things that people don'tnecessarily like thinking about but youknowethicscompliancesecurity you know in a couple thingsthat your gentlemen have hit on you knowearlier today is you know from asecurity standpoint is how is your datasecure you know is there is your dataleaving your organization and look I Ithink if you have a generative II toolthat's public facing and pulling yourdata in there are some serious concernsfrom a security standpoint are you areyou giving your IP as a business over toto chat GPT are you or you know are youable to create on your Google Cloudinstancea large language model and a tool and asolution that only pulls your data oronly ultimately pulls information fromyour data Lake that has a a a much moreyou know it's much it's a much betterstrategy from a security standpoint Ialso want to hit an fx and compliancehere in the sense of if you're if you'rehaving a tool that's pulling from youryour data stack and your your your datait's so much better from an ethics and acompliance standpoint because ultimatelythen you're not pulling from somebodyelse's information so many of us work inknowledge based businesses and we sellknowledge and expertise to our clientswhat we would hate to do at 66 degreesis sell somebody a solution where wecouldn't trace itand so what what we're doing isultimately modernizing our dataultimately in helping clients modernizetheir data and help build so that wedon't run into ethics and complianceissuesBrianna the last thing I just want tohit on and share isI think you have to takepeopleyour people into consideration here froma change management standpoint is youknow I I think we'd all be lying if wewe said you know Jenny I just give us alittle bit of butterflies in our stomachis you know what what's going to happento my job what's going to happen to mypeople's joband you know I I I've loved you knowgoing back and forth with Clive and Mattand Brianna and this is the sense of Ithink we have to answer that to ourpeople we have to face the toughquestions head on where we say hey thisis our generative AI strategy this ishow you as a manager and as a Frontlineworker going to be impacted andbenefitedby this strategy and then bring peoplealong for the rideshow them how people that know how touse generative AI are going to excel intheir careers I think change managementis essential in fact frankly look allthree of these pieces are critical butwe've got to bring our people along withus absolutely and Matt you work with ourclients often you talk to themfrequently what do clients and customersneed to understand about the process ofimplementing generative AI I think thebiggest thing is and I think Ben youmentioned it you just have to startright you don't want to be left behind Iheard this on a podcast so I'm going torepeat it because I it clicked in myhead it was amazinglook at Tesla right Tesla's got tens ofthousands of cars out there driving tensof thousands of miles buildingmillions billions trillions of datapoints can a test drive itself todayarguably not sorry sorry if you're aTesla owner no offense therebut five years down the road 10 yearsdown the road those millions billionstrillions of data points who in themarket is going to havethe Right Mix you know to be able toprovide the models to support thoseself-driving cars right so you thinkabout that from a generative AIperspective you really need to startyour strategy today now I'm not tryingto fear-monger anybody into thinking youhave to have this massive Enterprisesolution right I'm I'm thinking from acrawl up run perspective you knowstarting with starting with crawl helplet let Bard help you compose an emailor set a meeting agenda right you startto play with the tone you start to playwith you know the structure of thestatements right and hey your promptengineering day one Kudosas you build comfortability with itright you start to get into that walkphase you're going to start recognizingother areas whether it be other areas inyour own day-to-day workflow otherwiseit could be uh you know your team orsomewhere within your organizationyou're going to start to think aboutways that you can operationalize gen AIright and that could become a nicelittle project for the team we're nowadditional members of your team arestarting to get involvedand as you start to think about runthere's two things to to really start tothink about right you're ready toproductionalize this thing right you'reready to get past the science experimentI think you know a lot of folks are inthat science experiment stage but whenyou're ready to to productionalize thesetools uh you know you're starting tothink of a couple of different thingsright there's some of the total cost ofownership type considerations uh youknow do I have the staff right now thatknows how to work with this do I need toinvest in training for that staff do Ineed to bring on new staffum you know to augment the skills do Imake or buy this solution do I try andbuild this myself or do I work with acompany like 66 degrees that can helpaccelerate that time to Roium you know these are these are thetotal cost of ownership typeconsiderations but there's also the funtechnical considerations that I get tolive in my world as well right you'restarting to think of well how do wemaintain these models over time you knowBen mentioned carrying your team alongthere's there's absolutely a place whenyou talk about reinforce reinforcementlearning through human feedback backright it's excellent opportunity bothinternally as you're testing this outbefore you've even released it to getthat type of feedback that can helpaugment the tool that you're buildingand you're incorporating those folks aswell they feel like they're invested innot only using the technology but reallyhelping build it they feel like subjectmatter experts right you get into a muchlarger slew of considerations you startto think about the modern Emma lopsbeing llm Ops right how do we managedifferent versions of this model how dowe evaluate it against a baseline is itstill answering the questions thatinternally we ask or that our customersare asking you know we get into modelversioning right so as you start to asyou start to run that's where workingwith with an organization uh you knowlike Google like 66 degrees to help youget get through that that hump is iscritical yeah that it's fascinating youyou share this because I the word thatcomes to mind is Advocate you know if wecan create advocates in Oregon that heyI've used this as a as a business youknow owner or as a technology owner youknow then then I think oftentimes peoplein the organization can turn the lightbulb on and they and The Advocate canhelp those people turn the light bulb onuh you know I think if it's just the I.Tdepartment or just a businessstakeholder selling this it's a lotharder whereas if you have people in thefield selling this it gets a lot easieryeah yeahone thing if I may add them in twopoints you were brought up chainmanagement and as it turns to the jobsright so I'm just going to say thisopenly as an engineer AI is not going toreplace humans anytime soonhumans who know AI will do better withagainst humans do not know yeah that'sjust the reality right it's a new skilland the other thing you brought up andyou know when you talk about datacuration you talked about how you wantto put the gardens around itagain the grand scheme of things thegenerative AI as it relates totechnology as it relates to outcomes asit relates to the actual experience aend user gets regardless which Personait isyou have to keep in mind that the entireapplication infrastructure that wholemodernization that stack that stillneeds to move in the cloudthose those things still need to happenright generator AI is not a Panacea it'snot going to show up in a board room andsay go make my customers it's awesomeit's just not going to happen rightthere's a significant amount ofengineering what which is to happen hereto curate the data you need to have yourLanding Zone you have to have a securityposture so I want to ground people thatwhen when we talk gen AI it just had thetime to Value they can get from theirmigrations that's shrinks significantlybut the actual infrastructure and appmodernization still needs to happenand that's something we keep repeatingto people other people say oh wait I canuse it no no no you gotta still do allof this in the cloudso it's a good point you raisedyou bring up the the time to value andwe've had a couple conversations you'veall said it organizations need to startthinking about generative AI now or AInow uh why now what is what is going tohappen in the next say one five or tenyears that makes it so important becausefor for businesses to start thinkingabout this todaywhen you submit itum so let me leave you some examplesright we we saw how General Motors isusing the actual generative AI in theinteraction with End customer nowas a user as a consumer if I'm going andbuying a car tomorrow and you don't havethe OnStar like experience you're goingto lose that experience right off thebatwe saw how archana's team showed wherethey were able to look at the actualalerts tickets showing up in an emailand an actual response which is craftedwhere in the stack now think in terms ofa ticketing system now think in terms ofyour SRE Engineers or your supportEngineers if you are not able to go andmaintain that level of Engagement withyour end users your end constituentsyou're going to lose somebody else isgoing to move into that space so it allboils down to how rapidly you can makethis as part of your existing stackgenerative AI is not going to create anet new workload it's just going to makeyour income and workload a lot betterand you will see the way you engage withit just the natural language developerasking questions make this database goto the cloud SQL do it for me or take itall from an on-prem close proprietaryOracle database into something you knowgive me alloy DB those are things whichwill give the people who use Nai andintegrated a lot bigger Head Start so tospeak I mean this becomes Germany toyour volume propositionyeah I would I would say that if if Ihad to and Matt I'm curious on your yourthoughts where you're where you'reseeing over the nextnext one to five years but but I wouldsay if I if I had to say there's there'sthese four functions that are most ripefor disruption here's what I would say Ithink sales and marketing yeah I thinkyou know the the customer interactionand the ability to target market and theability to to frankly extend our salespeople you know I I I think the personthat has the highly sophisticatedsolution sale that's probably you knownot not going to get extended orprobably but you know certainly you knowcustomer interaction sales and marketingI think number one number number two Iwould say customer support you know andI think your OnStar example is perfectin this is that if if OnStar is reallyoffering this and GM is really offeringthisyou know you see labor shortages rightnow we're we're never going to find aPersonnel to to deliver that so how dowe amplify those customer success peoplewith technology and then I I thinkthere's two other areas that I think areare really you know if audience membersare sitting and thinking of how do Iapply this to my to my business it'ssoftware development is I think you knowpaired programming you know we're stillgoing to need great developers and greatEngineers there's no you know andfrankly we're short of a shortage ofthose at this point but to co-developyou know I think again about QA thinkingabout developing thinking about checkingfrom a code standpoint these are areaswhere jennai is really I think going tomake leaps in leaps and balls and then Ithink the last piece is is that you knowfor those you know if we have anybody inthe audience sitting in the in thePharma industry you know the r d space Ithink you know the the really where wecan rapidly see you know great use caseswith Gen AI is to to compress the timeto to launching a drug is in the r dbaseYeah you mentioned R D um you knowsomething that that really stands out tome um I see you know as I look into thefuture here I see uh a modernization ofthe marketplace in terms of monetizingthis right I see a Marketplace for largelanguage models uh you know so r d is aperfect example I think right now wehave you know these these largecommercial Behemoth but unspecializedlarge language models like Bard likechat gbt I think in the near-term futureit's already started we'll see highlyspecialized models out there in themarketplace for folks to be able to usethings like models specialized inresearch and development things forexperimentation and cost valuation Ithink we'll see models for legal legaldocument review case studies right I Ithink I think there's going to be anumber of those that come about yeah andcan I add one to it one of the thingswhen in my memory recall hereif you look at the way Vortex AIextensions have come in right where wecan actually tap into real-time datait's no longer just a frozen model butyou can tap into the what's going onpick your data source pick multimodal onthat and and marry it with what we areseeing in the ecosystem where we areseeing the first party open source aswell as third party adapters and modellanguages come in that is where thedisruption is going to happen you knowwhen I mentioned it's already happeningright yeah look at Ed pom too um thevehicle's already producing a healthcaremodel to help answer questions safelyand more accurately specific to themedical industryuh well you guys have given so muchinformation hopefully the audience feelsthe same way if there's one thing youwould want everybody here to leave withis there anything that comes top of mindthat everybody can take homeyeah I can go um you know I think Ithink Ben you mentioned it umyou need to understand that you're notrestricted to just using those largeBehemoth unspecialized data sources likeBard like Chachi PT uhthere's a lot of fear around you knowwhat if my my secret sauce you know mycompany's IP I'm asking it questions andthereby training with it right what'sreally important to note hopefullyyou're attending some sessions andlearning about like vertex model Gardenright you can you don't have to startfrom scratch on a Model you canabsolutely start with these foundationalmodels that that's your model you knowyou have the ability uh you know tofine-tune and train these things youhave the ability to keep thatinformation within your tenancy so theprivacy of the data shouldn't be aconcern to you I think that also reallyhelps from an ethical perspective aswell because you know at that pointyou're not worried about how Bard isbeing trained you are in control of theinformation that you're fine-tuning yourmodels and providing as contextyeahumlook Market leaders are made in times ofdisruption and this is one of thepivotal times in technology I've seen afew of themand if my one guidance is for the entireecosystem is understand gen AI not forjust the core of the technology butunderstand how it relates to your entirebusiness strategy right it's don't usetechnology for the sake of and look atevery single point in your entire valuechain where you can adopt it because ifyou don't your competition is I meanthat's happening as we speak that's howfast this space is movinguh I I played college football and uh Irecognized that uh if there's any othercollege or high school athletes outthere is that uhto to think that you're going to play agameyou know frankly better than youpractice is which it's foolish in manyin many waysumyou know the analogy I would wouldprovide is I think now is the time topractice and prepare your organizationand if I were to Think Through of youknow if I were preparing for a collegeswim meet or a golf match or a footballgame is what would my reps be at thispoint I would I would think across a fewa few points because I I don't thinkit's not like the Super Bowl is going tobe tomorrow or the nationalchampionships can be tomorrow but we'regoing to see this to your point thisdisruption it's coming it's coming in sohow do you practice right nowI would say you practice by modernizingyour data how do you how do you prep howdo you prep your datahow do you build Matt to your point howdo you build a proprietary solutionthat is unique and proprietary to yourbusinessyou know if people are keeping an eye onLinkedIn you know McKinsey is alreadyout there they have a proprietary modelthat's surfacing their information Ithink I think in many ways as we asknowledge companies and other companiesit's a great time to build a proprietarymodel on top of our modern data stackand then I would say is how are you howare you finding those advocates in yourbusiness that you can train the peopleso that they can get the most out of outof out of AI and you know I've seen astudy out there that says hey the middlemanagement and managers are the key tothis but I don't I don't disagreeactually I think the technology willwill progress so rapidly that it's ourresponsibility as leaders from an I.Tand a business standpoint to to enableour people to take advantage of thiswith usawesome well thank you to the three ofyou this does wrap our session as areminder we are 66 degrees Google Cloudpartner if you want to learn more aboutgenerative AI we have some demos goingon at Booth 609 around customerretention some investor reporting andplease come take a look we'd be happy tohave a conversation and thanks again forjoining us today we really appreciate itforeign"
