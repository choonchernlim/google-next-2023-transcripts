first jibu Thomas who is theEVP of online for Estee Lauder thank youit's great to be here and then we havePaul pushman who is the technical leadfor the cloud Center of Excellence atrayve digital thank you very much andI'm Amy Ashland I'm part of our retailindustry Solutions team here at GoogleCloud so thank you for coming um tostart I'd love to have you both kind ofintroduce yourself and your roleum we'll start with you jibu great yeahso jibu Thomas I've been at PLC now fortwo and a half yearsumprior to that Ium have spent a bunch of time in SiliconValley as an entrepreneur and thenleading transformations in uh at WalmartPepsiCo and now Estee Lauder Companiesso uh and ELC online uh it's roughlyabout third of our overall businessesum e-commerce and a significant part ofthat is direct to consumerand I'm Paul pushman so I'm a technicallead of the cloud Center of excellent asReeve digital which is located inWestern Germany next to Cologne or inCologne I've been at River digital atsince 2014 so working there first as indevops Engineers looking solutionarchitect and now as a technical lead uhalways uh one of the the firstintroducing Google Cloud to our companyand I'm currently now more on theinfrastructure level on theorganizational and networking sidethank you very much great so to start umI wanted to talk about uh just where weare right now in the in retail and Aiand AI truly has the capability oftransforming the industry if you thinkabout how people shop the steps reallyhaven't changed right I get discover aproduct I add it to my cards I check outI might get customer service along theway buttechnology and AI have dramaticallychanged how those interactions happenand now generative AI has the ability toaccelerate that change even furtherif we think aboutum we think about how generative Ai andAI in general can help the business withGoogle we look at these kind of threekey areas first it's built on afoundation of data and responsibilityand that really is the starting pointfor everything then when you think aboutthe key areas that it can help you knowthere's unlocking growth opportunitiesso thinking about digital experiencesprimarily digital experiences that canunlock growth opportunities then thereis I can't quite see driving operationalImprovement so you've got the greatyou've got great growth drivers and thenyou're thinking about how you can driveoperational improvements and efficiencyand then finally it's aroundtransforming the the store experienceand across both Ai and generative AIthese are really kind of the three keyareas that we see driving real value toretail P L's and again built on a datafoundation and a foundation ofresponsibilitythat data Foundation is absolutelycritical and that data goes beyond justspecific silos it goes into even theintersections of the of that data andlooking for opportunities to unlock newinsights by looking at data differentlyand Cloud really allows you to do thatthat's how we structured today'sconversation as well we're going to talkabout some of the kind of front-endexperiences and then talk about the datafoundations Ium we may have time at the end forquestions so we'll we'll see how it goesand if so would love you guys to come upand and ask questions so I want to startum Jibo with you first of all thank youvery much for participating in nextum it was great to see you called out inthe keynote yesterday and I know youwere up at leader Circle speaking aswell so thank you excited to have youhere as well great to be here umI uh the first question I wanted to askis any advice that you oops I'm goingthe wrong way still going the wrong waythere we goumany advice that youguyswe need some AI for this I mean I swearto you I'm pressing it in differentdirections and yet no matter what I'mdoing it's going the wrong way it's likeit's reverse engineered it's all it'sall me okay forget it we're gonna gowith this we're gonna go with this slideit's a great slideumadvice to our audience first on how youwould distinguish between kind of hypeand real value in uh in in kind of AIright now and generative AI as well yeahit's a great questionumso I would say you know the first thingisuh this is an enabler right and so youhave to anchor on the your businessstrategy consumer value all thefundamentals you would uh take care ofin any capability or enablement that youwould do the second thing I would say isum you know being right uh is often moreimportant than being first and nowthat's you know maybe not how SiliconValley operates right but when you're acompany withum not a startup with 75 years of Legacysignificant brand Equity consumer trustthat you know translates to irrationalbrand loyalty Etcyou have you want to be reallythoughtful about how you deploy usecases and really anchor it on value sothat's one of the things that we havedone is uh so when I joined the companytwo and a half years ago we made a betthat AI was going to be a significantenabler for us and we knew thatum it has the potential to redefine theway we do business now having boldvision and bold ambition didn't say makeus then say let's just go you know sprayand pray that we 100 use cases somewhich could have significant risk wesaid let's first build a very strongFoundation which you talked aboutwhether that's data whether that's anoperating environmentum and the good news was frankly beforeall this you know hype began with thewhole chat GPT thing it gave our teamsthe luxury to build things the right wayand now the advantage of all the hype isthat thethe ability the power of these you knowAI generative AI all these things havegone from sort of something that thenerds in the corner cared about tosomething that's in the mainstreamconsciousness of the whole executivesweet and so that's good because itgives you a lot of momentum but our usecases are very anchored on where itdelivers value andyou know we have more ambitious usecaseswhich we're more careful about balancingspeed and risk soyou know that's I I would really anchorit on business value versus what peopletry to convince you you know whetherthat'syou know vendors or agencies or whateverthat may have other other uhincentives but don't you know worry asmuch about your brand or your consumerloyalty as much as uh as you do yep thatmakes a lot of sense and it's not justabout the value we always think about ita lot of years in retail and I alwayscompared to like the shiny object versussomething that creates a lot of valueand value for not only you but mostlyfor your customers yeah absolutely Imean I in fact I always talk about thefact that saying yes to everythingdoesn't require judgment right it'ssaying no or not yet that requiresjudgment and that judgment really has tobe both business and Technical judgmentso you know we also invested in talentand expertise internally and Google hasbeen an incredible partner for us givingus early access to apis and you know sowhen people come and Pitch things to uswe often know more than the personthat's pitching ideas to us so about themodels about the um the use case Etcthat allows us to then make highjudgment decisions and the other pieceis really havingumAi and AI use cases and teams beingsuper integrated with the business ifthat doesn't happen then you know youcan become a science project and sothat's not uh that could also be anotherrisk that's great as you're thinkingabout these different use cases you haveoptions you have options to buildyourself you have the options to useoutside Partners how do you evaluatethat buy versus build decisionyeah I mean you know to be how we thinkabout it is really if there'sintellectual property or a competitiveAdvantage for us to do this we prefer tobuild right now there are some caseswhereumit's uh uh you know relatively commodityit's not core to how we do businesswithout consumers or Equity of OurBrands Etc we're happy to partner we'rehappy to buy so it's not dogmatic it'smore very very pragmatic and you know wehave the luxury of being able to investin these capabilities and bringing theright Talent Etc not every company uhmay be in that same position in whichcase I think each company has to makethat that decision uh for themselves butfor us really it boils down to you knowIP whether it's valueumyou know our ability to iterate theother risk is when youum again this is where sometimes youknowumthis idea of speed which is a veryromanticized concept and we all lovespeed but speed in the wrong directionif I can get you off of a cliff and sosometimes people in the name of speedwill you know get a hotspot of 15vendors and you create these disjointedexperiences that are really jarring tothe consumer and operationally reallyhard to manage so even if you're buyingyou really have to kind of think aboutyou know working backwards from what youwant this to be in the next couple yearsand say okay where does this fit youknow how do I make this operationallyeasy to manage how do I make sure thatthe experience is not jarring to theconsumer Etc so there's obviouslytrade-offs there great I want to shiftgears a little and talk aboutPrime complianceumhow what a safeguards that youget opportunitiesyeah so one of the first things we didwas we reallyum came up with a set of principlesum that were around responsible uh AIwhich we partnered with Google actuallyon which was fantastic and you know forus again there are many aspects to itobviously in consumer trust and andbrand loyalty is something that's reallyimportant to us brand Equity is reallyimportant to us so then there's sort ofyou know other considerations right youknow inclusivity orum you know promoting harmful beautystandards orum you know things where we may misleadpeople with digital misrepresentationusing synthetic models all of thosekinds of things in terms of achievableBeauty all of things that are very coreto the way we've done business for 75years we needed to preserve that sowe've set these principles which hasbeen a veryum uh you know uh key pillar to how wego about evaluating use casesprioritizing use cases Etc the and thegood news is we put these principles inplace before you know all this hypebegan and so people when it wasn't asimportant or urgent for people it waseasy to say here's how we should do itand people like yeah sure sure noproblem and so now the good news is whenit is important and Urgent to all partsof the organization we can say butremember we agreed to this and that'sthat's really great the second thing isyou know when in doubt we really or noteven when in doubt we we basicallyinvolve our legal you know and andprivacy uh folks in the things that wedo to just make sure that we're not youknow again the consumer trust piece isis and being responsible is really orthe regulatory piece and all those kindsof things are really important so that'skind of how we manage it at teams youknow we have teams embedded with us tohelp us navigate that Journey that'sgreatumand let's kind of as we think about thatyou mentioned as you've moved from kindof more traditional AI to generative AInow that we're in this you know era ofgenerative AI it can be a bitintimidating you guys have made somegreat progress and done some reallyinteresting things any advice for othersin kind of the retail and cpg Industryof how how do you how do you get startedhow do you how do you make your firstmoveI mean you have to start with again Iwould start with a consumer I wouldstart with the use case I mean that'show we started so for exampleum one of the first use cases that wedeployed actually uh in June withgenerative AIum we leveraged uh llms in June 2022before the whole chat DPT took the wallby stormum to on a use case which was reallyaroundconsumer classifying Consumer Care callsinto the right issue codes which we canthen feed back to both resolution ofthose issues but also you know whetherit's site merchandising or productdevelopment digital or physical in termsof consumer feedback and we found thatthe model wasum twice as accurate as humans inclassifying these codes and so for usthat is a really valuable use case thatinstantaneously paid off and the thebeauty of that was because we hadfocused on all that environment uhbuilding and setting the foundationright it was it just a matter of a dayfor an ml engineer to come up with thefirst you know prototype and then whichwe were able to put into production veryquickly and so againwe started with what was really our theDNA of the company so what separatesI'll give you a little bit of I'm notyou know I wasn't a beauty industryexpert before I joined ELC and I don'tanticipate that many people uh hear ourbeauty industry experts as wellone of the things thatum separates Prestige Beauty companiesfrom Mass Beauty companies is thisnotion of high touch for ELC definitelyyou know Mrs Estee Lauder uh it was likethe idea is the products that I'mrecommending to you is specific to youto be maximum efficacy versus what Iwould recommend to someone else and soin the offline world we talked to Beautyadvice we're beauty advisors and Macartists you know who help you come upwith those things and the consumer has aconversation with the people behind thecounter and service and Care are a bigpiece of that and so when we think aboutonline uh or digital engagement withthese consumers how we replicate thathigh touch experience online issomething that is really something wethink a lot about and so this use casefit with high touch because it washelping with care and we think of ourgenerative or AI or generative AI usecases as sort of how do we marry Hightouch with high tech to really deliverthat sort of next competitive Advantagefor this new world in which consumersare shoppingokay great thank you I'm going to ask aset of questions to to both of you nowand Paul I'm going to start with youJimmy you kind of started on theprioritization and so Paul that's thequestion for you as you're thinkingabout use cases and there feelssometimes like there's no limit to thenumber of use cases you can do as you'rethinking about use cases tell us abouthow you prioritize effortsso as you already said Googleprioritizing from the customer view orfor the customer benefit is always agood good first step to make and uhwhat will you also introduce or apply toour work is accept failure so uh notonly uh trying to to bring forward toone one thing that we thought of oneidea but but also to accept well thisthis is maybe something that thecustomer does not accept or that thecustomer does not pick up so maybe thetime is uh too earlyfor some feature for some AI functionwhatever could also be an optionthese aretwo things that are empowering us yeahgreatand you started you talked about this inyour uh in your conversationactually before I move on any anythingelse on prioritization that you'd wantto add you kind of addressed it but Iwant to make sure that I open it upno I I think it's really you know kindof I would say usefulness is the youknow business impact is the first of allthe the Baseline and then it's a balanceof you know risk versusumum value yeah and that's how I wouldthink about it I mean many of the earlyuse cases we've done for example youknow we use umuh general of AI for copy generation forSEO or product copy oryou know sentiment analysis of uhproduct reviews and so on which are allyou know immediate value for ourorganization and so not a high highlyrisky but there are some use cases thatwe're excited about that are maybe youknowum whereagents can you knowAI has agency to make decisions onbehalf of the consumer there we think alot about our timing and because it hasto be we have 20 plus Brands it has tobe in the right unique brand voice youknow we get nine things right onething's wrong one thing wrong that hasbig impact on the equity of the brandsEtc so it's really a risk calibrationand uh usefulness uh like I said againit's really a combination of businessand Technical judgment great thank youso let's talk a little bit aboutbusiness and Technical I'm going tostart with you againkind of within the worldespecially these customer facingEndeavors how important is thepartnership with between it and thebusiness and howthe change if at allso it has definitely changed and umso the for our case where we introduceour data platform for examplewe moved away from the old topic or theold pattern of having siled setups orsimilar but what we managed to get onthe eye level and uh discuss approachesand project ideas or possible solutionstogether so this was really importantcross-functional teams for example uhnot not that everybody is just workingon his topics but yeah transparentcommunication like thisum the site was a lot yeah yeah to cometogether and change the style of workingyes yeah that's great yeah I love thatyeah Iknow because Iyou know this idea of by the way I meanagain this is one of the things that Ithink separates Silicon Valley frommaybe moreum Legacy corporations is you know whenI was here uh being an entrepreneur younever thought about whose technology whois business right it'suh very very integrated right in morekind of Legacy companies there's thiswall between you know technology whichis more kind of almost seems like a backoffice kind of thing versusum versus a business and so we've reallyone of the big Transformations thatwe've really been driving now this ismore native to online but even Beyondonline with the whole Corporation is tosay you know these types of lean uhcross-functional teams are reallyimportant that work where the productperson and the data scientist is sittingwith the brand marketer or theyou know creative person to come up withyou know again they're working onspecific problems with shared okrshaving daily stand-ups all of this kindof stuff which what it really allowsalso uh the value that gets generatedthen issometimes you know the person who's notthat technicalum or you know a marketer may say oh I'mthinking about this problem this is howI'm going to solve it and you know adata scientist may say you know what Ihave a way to solve it that can automateit or give you a better answer or I canbuild a model whatever it is and sothere is a learning that happens or youknow a product folks are technical folkslearn about the aspects of the brandthat are so non-negotiable right whichagain if you're not that integrated it'svery hard to learn that now the keythere is you know you want to kind ofmove at the speed you can't let thisslow you down so it also you have tocreate the mechanisms whereyou can move fast and you have the rightuhuh processes to be able to do that andso that's something that we feel reallyexcited that we've been able to do overthe past you know especially over thepast couple years which and you knowwith zoom and promote working and allthose kinds of things people don't allhave to be in the same room and you knowagain you know in certain we weretalking about this before the panelthat cultural shift has also helped kindof this making that collaboration muchmore seamless yeah that's greata hidden benefit of all of that remotework I guessum all right Paul I would love to askyou some questions now I want to startwithum I want to start with you know how youand your teamare leveraging data you guys have donesome amazing work with with data how howare you how are you using it how are youusing data on specific use cases art canyou tell us more about how how you wentabout setting up the data foundation forthose specific use casesso to first introduce uh leave digital alittle bit more at some internal serviceprovider I.T service provider for theRiver Company and Riva is a foodretailer in Germany with a lot of storesand thousandsalso providing food delivery servicepickupconvenience stores and similarso and if you think about uh what whatis happening there with with customerscustomers going to our retail Sourcecustomers ordering onlineyou want to know more about thesecustomers and support them in buying theright things maybe also shiftingumour customers may be a bit also towardsorders offers so we want them to devisestaff and we want them maybe also to tofind out great new recipes to cooksomething special and yeah gettingstarted where we miss with morehealthier nutrition and yeahmy healthier food like thisand um yeah how did we start wellwe had the issue that the customer wasor customer data so that everything thatwe knew was about the customer wasdistributed so we knew we had customersuh using Facebook a lot we had othersocial media functions people weresearching for recipes and things likethat online so that were a bit similarto our use case or our productsandwhat we missed was a single view on thecustomerand the idea of our customer dataplatform was that we also internallynamed customer cloud is to to join allthese information and have a single viewon on a customer so that we can find outokay person number a uh is usingFacebook looking at recipes looking atspecial ads and and maybe clicks somecampaigns we haveandif we know for example the person is notinterested in mb for example why shouldwe promote Eve to him or her yeah sothis is uh for example something thatthat we can optimize andum I already mentioned so we havemultiple channels where we play outfor example ads or collecting data ordoing recommendations or similar thingswell all this is also costing money andin food retail the margins are a bitlower than in maybe other other goodsand so we have to take care so where tospend money and this is also a great wayso our goal was also not to know onlymore about the customer but also to bemore efficient so for example the theperson I mentioned which does not liketo eat meat for example so we just canstopum providing meat ads to him or her sothis is justum spending less money or if we alreadyknow well we haven't have a user of ouronline app is using a food deliveryservice a lotso we don't need to provide any more adsor incentives towards the food deliveryservice because we already know he's agreat customer and a loyal customer andumwe will we're still learningum and experimenting what what else canwe do but this was for example one onewas the very first use cases where we uhhad a direct impact and where we reallygot more more to know our customers andthere's maybe a lot of moreto find out and to experiment withthat's great I mean in changing fromwhat you're describing is changing fromthe product led to customer-led andcustomer Centricany cultural challenges in making thattransitionas I mentioned uh so so this uhthisnot to provide any more silos orsupporting silos always having somebodyin the fridge like this bringing teamstogether and alsoum yeah really bring them together interms of not via a hangout meeting butpersonally and discussing in person anddoing everything to the core has had alotumalso with a certain openness to to forexamplenot be shy of dumb questions so there'sno dumb questions yeah so sometimesumyeah you have some some audience in yourmeeting and some questions are not askedand sometimes it's really good idea toask us just ask the question that goesto the core or maybe that Xforces someone to explain something thatgives a broader view on the topic couldfor example help to just every bringeverybody to the same level and then beyeah on eye levelon the topic so on your solution thatyou want to provide or umor even the discussion itself yeah ifyou're in the fridge is a big unlock yesand soa similar questionthe privacy and compliance how did youthink about data privacy and complianceas you're setting up your customer dataplatform yeah this is a a very big Topicin Europe so the gdpr uh General dataprotection regulations are very strongand we really need to take care aboutthisso from the beginning it was a keyfactor to the solution that wethere's no no other way than to obey tothese regulations it's it's not notpossible otherwiseand on the other handum what are we doing with with foodretail where'sin the sort we were doingyeah Mass market so it's not thatpersonalized although I mentioned theperson not not liking meat but uhum it's not that person like in otherumareas or business areas butum you can more easily segment peopleand so we wouldworking better on a completely differentlevel so we were not working on aone-to-one relation so we're not mappingone specific person to some campaign orsimilar but what we are doingsegmentations for example and by thisum anonymize uh the information of thecustomer so so we don't Target specificcustomers for example butum yeah use segmentation for example toum to feed campaigns or to feedum Target groups or similarso this is one one thing from from theconcept but also technically we erase inour data flow of these personalinformation completelythe sort of quite a huge effort alsowith the legal team and data protectionPersonnel to to find out what is actualdata that is to be protected so what isreally private datasowhat what do we have to kick out of ourdata set yeah what are we able to allowso what is maybe General enough to notspecific to a personal similar and umyeah this is quite some effortum together with our partner Lord we hadthem a really great team uh supportingus there on the task of finding exactlythis out and also building the rightprocesses and infrastructure toyeah achieve this goal to provide a gdprcompliant platform for our customerCloud yeah yeah that's great thank youyou guys thank you very much uh reallyappreciate you listening in thank youvery much to our speakers really enjoyedhaving you thank you for all of theinsights that you shared uh and I hopeyou all enjoy the rest of next[Applause]"
