web 3 efforts in Google Cloudum and I'm excited to talk to you aboutwhat we're doing how we're helping web 3developers build on top of Google cloudand also uh introducing you to natashwho's going to be I'm talking about howthey use some of our tooling andservices so first of all how many of youare web3 developers are activelybuilding in the spaceokay one how many of you like haveplayed around with it and like at leasthave understanding of the basicsokay and then the rest of you areprobably pretty new to it so that'shelpfulum awesome well let's get startedum I think we'll we'll explain a littlebit about what we're doing in web 3 andwhat it's all about hereumso really quickum I'm Nolan I've been working at Googlefor about seven years started onFirebase worked on Hotel search andsince 2017 I've been building withethereum and solidity building dapps onthe blockchain and last year I was luckyenough to join the founding product teamin Google Cloud on building specificallyfor this spaceum and then with me I have nitesh surewhy don't you just introduce yourselfreal quick and then we'll move forwardso Mike working here great hi guys higuys my name is the Tish uh very luckyme Nolan and working with Google Clouduh I originally went to Stanford studiedCS in cryptography also minored inphilosophyum I started on blockchain around 2020.um started off initially working infintech before at a toronto-basedfintech and then spend some time over atAlchemyum work on their basically node enginethere and then a super short stand atcoinbase before I started Axel and beganworking with the Google Cloud teamawesome thank you and we're going tohear more from Natasha in just a minuteum and how they use Google cloud and howthey're building dapps but first we'lltalk a little bit about what is web3right you hear that term a lot you hearweb 2 web 3. so if we talk about webwhen I talk about web3 I like to thinkabout it as the third iteration of theinternet as we use it today so if youthink about web one being really aboutconsumption content consumption only asmall handful of people are creatingcontent like newspapers or Publishersand everybody else was consuming itum so think like Yahoo early Google daysand then we move to web 2 we didn'treally call it that at the time but it'sreally when we started having the massescreate content right so blogging socialmedia phones really accelerated this andnow everyone is producing contentfor the internet and and there's a lotof people also consuming but now web 3gives us an opportunity where in web 2where when you created the content itwas wasn't really yours right yousubmitted it to platforms they monetizedit shared Revenue with you web3 isreally about you owning the content youcreate and you can do you being able tomonetize that on your terms and andreally having all that ownership beingable to sell it rent rent your uhdigital assets so it's an entirely newworld and it's pretty exciting so someof the principles around web3 that makeit really work are it's decentralizedright and that really means that there'sno Central player controlling theinfrastructure everyone can run some ofthe infrastructure and participate inthat which makes it really hard for asingle entity to make decisions aroundyou know how this should work it'spermissionless much because you knowthere's no single entity controllingthings everyone has access to thisinfrastructure in these applications sothat's really exciting and then it'salso trustless you don't have to oneWonder like you know if I send this tosomebody is it going to be there you cantrace that you can see the data you canverify that on your own and one thingthat's really exciting exciting aboutweb3 is that payments are natively builtinto this technology right so before youknow as the internet came about a lot ofour financial institutions start doingthings onlinethat was like taking an old system andmoving to a digital world in in web 3currency and and and money are part ofthe technology so you have programmablemoney by default which is a whole new uhuh Worldum so what has Google been doing in web3um you know a lot of people probablydon't know that we've been doing thisfor a long time even our timeline startsbefore what's on the screen so westarted indexing blockchain data andmaking it available in bigquery in 2018and we continue that those efforts andwe'll talk a little bit about that in2020 uh in February we joined the hederagoverning Council and we're stillmembers of that and we run a validatorfor them and then 2021 we startedhelping a lot of web 3 native companieswith their workloadsQ4 of 2021 we actually did like an nftlaunch for creatorsum to to reward them for theirsubscriber bases and things like thatand then as we started doing more andmore with web3 with our customerswhether they were web3 Native customersor web 2 companies making a shift toweb3 we realized there was a hugeopportunity to build a product groupspecifically focused on web3 and that'sthe team that I'm onum later that year last year weannounced the preview for blockchainnode engine and we'll talk a lot aboutthat product today that's now in GAwhich is not on the screen but in latelast year we also announced apartnership with Solana so we're reallysupporting that ecosystem blockchainnode engine and a lot of our dataproducts will supportum so the Solana ecosystem and then wealso announced that we're running avalidator with Aptos which is one of thenewer blockchains with a lot of scaleand low gas fees and then later thatthat year we also announced a coinbasepartnership so the they're running a lotof their workloads with gcp and thensimilarly we're going to be supportingthe polygon ecosystem we also launched aweb 3 startups program which I'll talkabout in a minute so it's been a reallybusy year for us in the last like 18months and A lot's been going on and ourgoal in Google cloud is really to be thedefault place for web 3 developers tobuild right we're really focused onEnterprise grade node infrastructuremaking data really easy to access todayblockchain data is not not very easy toaccess it's not really optimized forquerying so we want to make it moredemocratized and then we want to alsohelp educate developers web 2 developershow to build on web3 new new users thathave no familiarity with web3 how likewhat it means and what the values andadvantages areum so what does it mean to build a Dapfirst of all a Dap is a decentralizedapplication right so it's not anapplication that just lives on oneserver in the cloud it's spread acrossthat decentralized node infrastructureand it's a completely different way ofbuilding and fundamental to buildingadapt is reading and writing blockchaindata right so to it's you can think ofit as a new database in its simplestform except that database isdecentralized and is all over all of theinfrastructure that's running nodes andso the most fundamental thing you needto start building adapt is an RPC nodeso that's a node that lets youcommunicate with the blockchain toeither read data or write data theethereum ecosystem has two kinds ofnodes a full node and an archive nodefull node store just the last 128 blockswhile archive nodes store all the blockslike the entire history of theblockchain locally so depending on youruse case you might use one or the otherand then you know if you want to that'sreading if you want to write to theblockchain you either sendethereum ether which is the nativecurrency of the ethereum ecosystem toanother wallet address or you caninteract with a smart contract whichmight write data to to the blockchainbut for any of those use cases youreally need this thing called an RPCnode which participates in the networkand syncs data with the rest of theblockchain and it's not trivial to runone of these things right so first youneed to get storage and compute maybe inthe cloud maybe on-prem then you'dinstall the client software and makesure that works well then you need towait for that client software to syncwith the blockchain that can take youknow in worst cases like months so ittakes a long time because there's a tonof data and then you need to make surethis thing stays up or you know you'reeffectively disconnected from thenetwork so that might mean in restartingthe machine or installing the latestversion of the software so we saw thisproblem and we said you know Google'shas a lot of expertise runningEnterprise grade infrastructure we canbuild something that helps a lot ofdevelopers in the space so we builtsomething called blockchain node engineit's a fully managed RPC node serviceright so we take care of everything foryou you click a single button in our UIor make a single call to an API weprovision the node we install the rightsoftware We sync it with the chain wemonitor it we upgrade it for you and wetake care of all the headaches ofrunning a node we like to say we giveyou all the flexibility of aself-managed node without any of theoperational overhead or headaches so wejust take care of that problem for youand it's fully configurable right so youcan choose the configuration of the kindof node you want whether it's you knowthese things that are specific to theethereum ecosystem a full node anarchive node whether it's productionmainnet or a development test net youcan choose what region and you want yournode deployed in what that can beimportant for either performance orcompliance reasonsand then you know this is Enterprisegrade right what we hear from a lot ofcustomers is I use an RPC service but itworks 99 of the time it's really not thereliability users expect at this pointin time right so we see our role asbeing able to elevate infrastructure forweb3 to being like that nine that fivenines of reliability we give you Cloudarmor so your nodes protected from DDOSattacks we let you manage your own APIkeys with their own rate limits so youcan distribute those to either yourmembers of your own organization oroutside of your organization and we havegreat throughput up to like 5K QPS andwe've actually tested much higher 10KQPS and you know one of the things thatwe've heard of this is one testimonialfrom ens Labs they're the ones who havethat dot power the dot eth domain ifyou've seen that and so they're usingDNA now and they found that it workssignificantly better than the incumbentsolutions that they were using andreally helps them with performance andreliability which is super important forfor enslabs and with that I wanted totoss it over to nitesh to talk about howAxel is using blockchain node enginethanks so much null and that was a superawesome overview and as someone whopreviously used to work in nodeinfrastructure um over at Alchemy whichis essentially like a competing serviceI can definitely say that I and our teamhas been super pleased with theexperience Google's had to offer how doI um like change slides just use thecomputeroh I guess you just sweet so for us itwas a pretty long journey in terms youknow so to give some background ourcompany Axel we're basically ablockchain infrastructure companyfocused on D5 so we built apis to helpdevelopers integrate blockchain basedFinance essentially defy into theirapplications and services really easilyin just a few lines of code so if youwant to be able to read D5 data likecritical prices stats if you want to beable to do right actions like Nellamentioned be able to you know lend moneyor swap currencies on stake for exampleyou guys may have heard about that inthe ethereum staking ecosystem you cando that all through our API withouthaving to write super complex smartcontract infrastructure and spend up todays and weeks managing your owninfrastructure so for us we had a prettylong journey in terms of trying tounderstand who the best node providerwas and how could we get our needs metwe required quite a bit of data justbecause as I mentioned we're a readwrite service for defy so we have a lotof data that we need to obviously storeand provision as well as serve to ourcustomers in a really low latency way sofor us we needed a node that would giveus the full suite and we startedexploring the market you know whetherthat was Alchemy what that was Moralesinferior any of the other kind ofdifferent node providers just from likea user perspective and developperspective we found that our needsweren't being met in many areas simplyjust because of the product in fact likea lot of node Services out there and alot of just providers that are trying toprovide data aren't providing you thecomplete data set they might not beproviding you the granular what we liketo call Trace data which is kind of theunder the hood data that a lot ofblockchain companies may need basicallyto service their customers and weactually found that Google would give usthe full Suite both what we you know asNala mentioned the archive nodes soessentially not just getting the last128 blocks the most recent history butwe were looking for the whole changehistory and the whole history of defyGoogle node engine was able to providethat to us in addition we also werelooking for very granular data right asyou guys know blockchains are theseledgers are different transactions andthese transactions get pretty complexthey might actually be a simple ethereumtransfer like me to nullin but it mightbe something super complex like I call avery complex program on a smart contractright and that smart contract will callanother smart contract so go back toyour programming days in college whenyou were thinking out stack traces andyou're trying to trace through everysingle um you know call On The Stackright that happens on blockchain andit's all done through value transfers sowe were trying to get a lot of thatstock trades data and a lot of providerscouldn't give that to us Google couldand not only could they do it for usthat way but they could also provision anode dedicated just for us what thatkind of means is that a lot of differentproviders in the space they like to kindof give you an API you can read andwrite data from they might set a loadbalancer on top of a fleet of differentnodes for you to kind of load balanceacross but as you guys know blockchainsare asynchronous distributed systems andnot every node has the same perspectiveon the Chain they might believe that onestate is different than the other youmight get requests to different nodesthat believe in different states so theproblem there is that your API isn'titem potent and you don't get back thesame response every time and that makesfor a horrible customer experienceGoogle gave us one node where theresponse will be the same every time andthat was super reliable and really easyto use additionally also one thing wereally cared about we're a seed StageCompany we care a lot about pricingright we want to make sure we're notblowing the bank out and we you knowobviously have a limited amount of cashGoogle was able to be really friendly tous not just through their creditsprogram which I'll talk about in asecond but also through their fixedpricing program we actually gotunlimited access to a dedicated archiveTrace node for a really low amount ofmoney a month and that wasn't reallylike hard for us to get and Google teamwas super friendly and was able to giveus access as well as great customersupport with our team so in terms ofjust the product perspective Googlereally met our needs from a productperspective but then also from acustomer experience standpoint wasreally able to work with us on thingslike pricing customer experience to getus the Best in Class service so we couldserve our customersum and I'll talk a little bit about Iguess the Google Cloud credits programso again when we started off like notonly were we able to get great pricingand of course an amazing service throughthe Google node engine or the blockchainnode engine but we also were actuallyoffered 200 000 in startup credits forour team um as a CSH company obviouslywe're trying to cut costs we're tryingto keep lean especially in this marketum you know obviously blockchaincompanies are really going through itright and we want to make sure that weare staying lean mean and super fastum and Google is able to help us outwith that and give us basically 200 000on to be able to spend on what thatserver infrastructure Cloud instructornode and structure and really the wholegamut um so this is really helpful forus because right now obviously we'redoing lower traffic than we would be inone to two to three or four years as youlook to scale up and as we look toactually bring about more customersactually scale up our traffic Googlescales with us and is able to give usyou know obviously a lot of money ofcourse to be able to support that butalso the Enterprise grade infrastructureas non-advention for us to support ouroperations really effectively um sowe've been really pleased with theexperience and obviously happy to talkmore about any questions or any specificthings but um but essentially yeahthat's my experience with Googleblockchain node engine I know that um Iknow they're in closed beta right now ifI'm correct um or have you guys OpenAccess yet fully public it's reallypublic now okay cool I remember when weat first Matty was kind of like in thattransitioning stageum but yeah it's a really great serviceI've been very pleased with theexperienceforeign"
