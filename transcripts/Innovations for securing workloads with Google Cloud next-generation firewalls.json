    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good afternoon everyone welcome to thebreakout session on Innovations forsecuring your workload with Google CloudNext Generation followersmy name is Tracytoday I will be delivering the sessiontogether with two of my colleagues Meganand Susan and our customer speakerRichard from McKessonI hope the message will be bringing toyou in the next 45 minutes it's going tobe an exciting ending to your first dayand nextin today's session we'll introduce thecloud NG firewall Megan and I are goingto give you the product details from aPM perspective that Richard will sharehis perspective as a customer based onhis experience with the productthen susha will be joining us to discusshow the open architecture offered by thecloud NG firework is going to allow youto easily insert a third-party fileprice of your choice into the systemand in the end we'll leave time toanswer your questionsokay let's get startedhere on the screen you see a chargeshowing you growing trend of Cyberattack and how quickly an attack canpenetrate once it gets into yourenvironmentthis is probably not the first time yousee a chart like thisand yes today I'm going to remind youagain the danger is still out thereby moving your workload into the publicCloud all this threads are not going tosubtly go away in fact in certain casesthe lateral movement of the stretch canget even fastertherefore you need effective tool toprotect yourselfwhile Cloud presents some uniquechallenges for security it also give usa unique opportunity to rethink theproblem of network security and redesignthe system that can best protect you inthis new era and that is what we aregoing to share with you todayyou better serve our customer we firstlisten to themhere are some of the top asks we havebeen hearing from them over the yearswhen it comes to their need for networksecurity in the cloudfirst they need the best threat andvulnerability protection they can get toprotect them against the attack comingfrom all different directionsthen they need simplicitythey won't fully manage service thatauto scales they want the firewall rulethat are easy to configure and easy tomaintain over timethey also need both Broad and deepcontrol into every workload they putinto the cloudand when bad things happen they want tobe able to take actions quickly tocontrol the damagethose are the asks that we keep in mindwhen we design and implementthe cloud NG firewallin the past two yearswith this product we hope to give you abrand new way in applying networksecurity control to the dynamic workloadin the cloud environmentthe product comes with the Three corepillars Advanced thread protectionsimple fast and scalable and a uniqueset of capabilities to help you governthe network security posturenow let's take a look at them one by oneAdvanced threat protection is always oneof the first things customers ask of uswhen they put their business criticalassets into our hands to host for themto satisfy their needs we chose topartner with the market leaderwe partner closely with the Palo Altonetworks to integrate their Marketleading threat prevention engine deepinto our systemthe engine is powered by powerful mltechnology as well as massive data andinsights that they collect across theglobal deployment basewe combine this with the threatintelligence we get from mending andother groups of Google and get a threatprevention engine that is powerfulenough that we can protect our customerwith strong confidencenow we need to put this powerful engineinto action for that they needSimplicity scalability and performanceand that is where our fully distributedfirewall architecture comes into playtraditionally when you deploy fireworkyou put the firewall appliancesyou configure routing policy to sendyour traffic to those appliances thenyou configure the rules in theappliances to inspect the traffic thatyou send through themin Google Cloud we took a differentapproachwe adopted a fully distributed filearchitecture and we built our firewalldirectly into our software definedNetwork and we plant the federalinspection point right next to every VMinterfacewith such architecture we can make surethe security always follow the workloadand we allow our user to turn on thesecurityacross the entire cloud with zerorouting changesthis firewall fabric provides a fullprotection for all workload that youbring onto Google Cloudno matter is running over GCE instanceor gke notes it works for traffic in nodifferent directions Ingress egressnorth south and east westwe integrate this with the IEM governtag to give our customer a very reliablemechanism for micro segmentation andgive them extremely granular controlwith the system our customer canliterally turn on any firework controlbetween any two directly connectedinterface in Google Cloudincluding Advanced threat preventionthat is two interfaces across two periodNetwork within the same VPC Network oreven within the same subnetthe fully distributed data planautomatically skills with the dynamicworkload you bring into the cloudand the instancewill be protected with a fast inspectionand the engine introduced minimumlatency during the inspectionbuilt on top ofthis massive firework fabricit's a unified firewall policy that'sused to govern every workload and theirsecurity policiesbecause the security deposites isenforced out of the routing fabrictherefore those policies can beindependently audited and insuredwithout worrying about any securitydrift by accidental routing or networkconfiguration changesevery policy deployed will provide thecontrol for all the workloads in itsscope that scope could be an org afolder or a network that include bothexisting workload and new workloadthat's deployed whenever there's a newworkload that is deployed in the cloudthe system will make sure to deploy therelevant rules into the workload and getthat into action beforeyou will even allow the workload to sendor receive the first packetand if our customers have the firewalllogin turned on we'll also give them amail-based recommendation to help themconfigure and maintain a strict rule setover timesince the policy can be deployed at thedifferent layers of the gcp resourcehierarchy starting from the org followedby folder and then go to the VPC Networkthe policy enforcement order alsofollows this top-down orderthis type of mechanism makes surewhatever the policy you configure anddeploy at the organization level cannever be violated by accidental policychange at the lower levelof the hierarchy such as the projectunless you explicitly ground anexception for themwell we give you all the mechanism tohelp you maintain and control yourfirewall configuration we understandsince you happen when there's baddingsthat happening you need to take actionand that's where the tag-based rulecomes into the picturewith a tag based rule you canpre-program a set of reaction functionsthrough those rules and when the badincidence happensall you need to do is to apply thespecial tag into the infected system soall the pre-pro programmed reactionswere getting to the place and help youcontrol the damageall right I hope you get excited enoughand I'll pass it over to Megan to giveyou further informations on this newproductMeganthank you so much Tracy as Tracymentioned cloud ngfw is built with PaloAlto networks Technologiesmany of you are already familiar withPalo Alto Network's threat preventionTechnologies let's see why it mattersthat we built this product using PaloAlto Network's prevention enginePalo Alto networks threat preventionengine is processing more than 15trillion transactions per day which arecoming from all of the firewalls andendpoints that they have deployed acrosstheir huge customer baseon top of that they have more than 200threat researchers who are going througheach of these threads and digging deeperand making sure they have a goodunderstanding of threat landscape andreleasing ongoing updatesto protect the customersthe result of this is more than 4.3million updates every day to make surecustomers are protected against thelatest zero day attackslet's take log4j as an example thenlog4j incident happened many Enterpriseswere impactedthe ideal solution to address log 4Gwould have been upgrading all thesoftware internally however that wouldhave been a super lengthy processand that's where the importance ofhaving a security vendor such as PaloAlto networks becomes apparent becausePalo Alto networks was quick inreleasing an update to make sure theyidentify any kind of exploit sessionsthat we're trying to take advantage oflog4j vulnerabilityhaving talked aboutlog4j and vulnerabilities and exploitslet's take a look at what are thedifferent types of attacks that cloudngfw can protect you againstthe first type of attacks isvulnerabilities and exploits the secondtype is threats and the last one iscommand and control attacks when you'retalking about vulnerabilities andexploits we are talking about thingslike buffer overflowswhen we think about threat preventionthey're talking about making sure wehave protection against virus or spiralas well as known or unknown malverand when you're talking about commandand control attacks many of you arefamiliar with this category which issuper important is making sure we flagany kind of inbox inbound or outboundconnection to malicious domains as wellas inspecting the payload to make surethere is no command and controlcommunication happeningohnow what we did since security efficacyis super important for us and was thefirst and highest priority for us whenwe were releasing Cloud ngfw what we didwas making a comparison between ourproducts and other Cloud firewalls outthere to see how we are performing interms of security efficacyand as you can see here we were moreefficient in blocking any kind ofcritical or medium attacks or highattacksyeah compared to all the other of twoother Cloud vendors out thereum so you can see this is very importantbecause you want to make sure when youbuy a cloud firewall it comes with anout of the box rule set which isprotecting you against all these kind ofattacks from day onenow let's talk about otherdifferentiators here Tracy alreadytalked about Simplicity and performancenow let's take a deeper look so what yousee on the left side is a traditionalfirewall deployment and on the rightsideis a cloud ngfw deployment model we areprovided providing to you so there arethree main important things that you cannotice with the firewall deploymentfirst it's where the firewall isdeployed the second one is how you aredefining the traffic that is routed tothe to the firewall and the last one ismaking sure thatum this where this security controls areenforced is it that perimeter is itclose to the workload and when do youlook at this picture you can see thatbasically with the new with thetraditional firewall you had theperimeter base I Appliance or virtualvirtual VM that you're deploying at theperimeter and you have to Route all thetraffic from your workloads to thisfirewall to and you need sometimes youneed to make architectural changes forthisand all of the enforcement is onlyhappening at the perimeter where thefirewall is deployed however let'scompare it with Cloud ngfw that we'retalking about today with Cloud ngfw asTracy talked aboutwe have to distributed stateful firewallwhich is getting deployed as close tothe workload as possible it's right atthe VM interface level and what itbrings you as a customer is ability toinspect the traffic whether it's eastwest or north north South traffic aswell as being able to deploy thisfirewall without any kind ofarchitecture changes or routing to beable to send the traffic to thisfirewall we have had this Cloud firewallwhich provided you with layer 3 and 4inspection in this distributed fashionfor a long time but now we're takingthis one step further by introducinglayer 7 inspection capabilities on topof the same architecture this is againanother differentiator for us which israther than providing you anotherdifferent rule base for layer 7inspection we have built the layer 7inspection on top of the samedistributed firewall which means we areenabling you to do the inspection asclose to the workload as possiblehow we do this is using a new technologycalled packet intercept which is part ofthe Google Cloud's Andromedasoftware-defined networkingenables us to have these firewallendpoints located in the same Zone asyour workload being able to be like justlike a bump in the wire like routing thetraffic close to the workload to thefirewall endpoint inspecting the trafficusing the Palo Alto networks firewallwhich is running under the hood and thenenforcing the policy you set andcontinuing with their flowlet's talk about what value this bringsto you so umTracy touched on this topic already soone of the biggest values of thisarchitecture and this partnership withPalo Alto networks is the operationalSimplicity we already talked aboutsecurity efficacy now operationalSimplicity has been top of mind for manyof our customers with the traditionalapproach you have perimeter rules andsometimes you have workload rules aswell but they're only for layer 3 and 4.and anytime there is any change in yourinfrastructure when you have newworkloads for example you have to havethis manual process making sure yourpolicies are up to date or just yourposture is secure and is reflecting thesame infrastructure workloads that youhaveif there is an incident happening itmight be super slow to go brute forceand making sure the policy is appliedeverywhere versus the new model withCloud ngfw we are providing you with asingle policy which is basically thishierarchical policy Tracy talked aboutcombining workload and perimeterbringing both layer 3 and 4 all of themall next to the workload and making surethe policy is following the workloadusing the IAM tags enabling you to writethese policies and it simplifies yourincident response process as well so ifthere is any incident rather than thatmanual process policy is going toautomatically be applied to all of yourworkloads that you're defining with thatpolicyLet's uh talk about Cloud ngfw I willclose my section by wrapping it upsaying what are the different tiers whenwe say cloud ngfw cloud ngfw is consistsof three main tiers Essentials standardand plusCloud firewall stands Essentials hasbeen there for a long time you'reprobably using it which is covering L3and 4 inspection we recently launchedCloud firewall standard which is addingthreat intelligence fqdn objects and andgeolocation objects and with thispresentation I was telling you aboutCloud firewall plus which is basicallyproviding you with layer 7 inspectionsacross TLS and non-tillas trafficpowered by Palo Alto Network threatprevention Technologies we are going toRebrand Cloud firewall to Cloud ngfwnext yearI wrap up my talk and I would like toinvite Richard one of our dear customersto walk you through his journey withCloud firewall Richardforeignhi everyone my name is Richard PrasadI'm a network security architect withcover my meds I covered my meds as abusiness unit of McKesson we are in thehealthcare industryas a network security architect I designengineer and implement the network andnetwork security components that protectour environments and workloadstoday I would like to talk about networksecurity architecture in the cloud andhow Google's firewall products helps ussecure our workloads and environmentsso what we have here is a typical VPC orI'm sorry a typical Hub and spoke DesignThis is modified in the sense that I dohave a separate inbound Hub that I willexplain in a bit in more detaila large driver of this design came fromOperational Support perspectivethis needs to be easyto understand and to supportand this designmeets all of those requirementsthis design uses shared vpcshost and service projectsat the center is the transit hubthis is where all of our networking andnetwork security takes place thisincludes Cloud routersinterconnects vpns and our Transitfirewallsall of the spokes in this designappeared to this Transit hubwith the exception of the sandboxesthe VPC spokes are essentially anapplication or application groupthe spokes appeared as I mentionedearlier to the transit hubeverything traverses through thisTransit hubso let's say we have an application inspoke a that wants to talk to anotherapplication in Spoke Bthat is going to Traverse that Transithubif spoke B needs to get out to theInternet it's going to go through thatTransit hubconsequently if on-premise needs to talkto one of the spokes it's going toTraverse that Transit Hub and vice versaif a Spoke needs to talk to on-premiseumfor the inbound partwe decided to split our inbound trafficso that is where the modified portion ofHub and spoke come inif a customerand the internet internet-based customerneeds to access an application in aSpoke they're going to come through theinternet come through this inbound Hubthe inbound Hub has its own networkingand network security stack and then gointo the application spoke and then ifthat application spoke needs to reachfurther inbound it'll go through thattransits hubthe not all spokes are going to beinternet accessible not all of them willneed inbound access so those that do notneed that access will not be peered tothat inbound hubthe sandboxes are basically a techplaygroundwhere you can try new ideas and newtechnologiesthose sandboxes do not have anyproduction datado not have any non-prod dataand they're not connected to the devenvironments or the productionenvironments at all they're completelyisolatednowhow do we secure thiswell the first part is with the classicGoogle firewalls these are great they'refast they're simplethey're easy to maintainbut a huge part of network security isvisibilityand we need that layer 7 visibilityso what we have decided to do in thisdesignis to deployVM based Palo Alto Auto scaling firewallappliancesbecause the hubs are Central toeverything we've decided to put them inthat Center transits Hub as well as theinbound hubthese next-gen firewalls are at the coreof our designso being that these are Palo alto's weare now able to achieve top of classapplication visibilitythe transit firewalls for both theinbound and the Hub uh since they are VMappliances integrate directly withpanoramaso managing them is a very familiar feelyeahwhile I current design Works fairly wellwe do have a few challengesfirst we have multiple layers offirewall rules that we have to managewe've got the gcp firewall rulesand we also have Palo Alto firewallrulesthere is routing and network maintenancethat has to happenevery time we add a VPCor a subnet we need to manually addstatic routesto the route tables on the Palo Altoappliancesour Auto scaling design for the Paloalto'srequires the use of source netting orsnatsthis adds a layer of complexity whenwe're trying to troubleshootwe also have to write and maintainseparate terraform codefor the Palo Alto deployments as well asthe cloud native firewall rulesthen there is also the maintenance ofthe VM Palo Altoscode upgradeslife cycle maintenance licensingsizing requirements costas well as Auto scale monitoring andmaintenancewith the addition of firewall plus tothe product catalog we are now able tomaintain our efficacywith Cloud native firewalling and thepower the power of the Palo Alto threatinjured behind it we now have the sameor better level of protection as withthe VM Palo Altoswe can maintain our health careRegulatory Compliance and increase ouroverall security posture by introducingless complicationswe also have easier TLS implementationwhich also means better visibilitythe distributed data plane will also letallow for Less firewalls overall withoutlosing performance or resiliencywe can achieve East-West and north-southprotection without multiple sets offirewallsit also increases the Simplicity of thedesign and the overall maintenancewith firewall plus there are no routingchangesthere's no more snaps to worry about wehave simplified terraform coding andalso faster deployment timesnow I'd like to talk a little bit abouta conceptualnext version design using firewall Plusnow this is a similar Hub and spokedesignthe difference here is I can collapsethis down into one VPC and multiplesubnetsbecause of the design Simplicity and thecloud native integrationit's even easier for our operations teamto understand and maintainI have uh it's easier to implement microsegmentation as wellthe distributed data plane will increasethe overall performance of ourenvironmentsand being powered by Palo Alto threatengines we can actually increase ourlayer 7 visibility and increase theefficiency of our designoverall firewall plus is an amazing andPowerful addition to the Google productlineand will definitely help secure yourworkloads in a simpler and moreefficient wayI'd like to now hand the presentationover to our next presenter sushant[Applause]thanks returnwe at Google Cloud are all about meetingcustomers where they are we understandthat not every one of your networksecurity needs can be met with our firstparty native Solutionswe know that some of you have apreference towards using your trustedvendor solutions to protect your GoogleCloud workloads so in the next fewslides I'm going to provide a sneakpreview into the things that we areworking on to make it easy for you todeploy and consume your choice ofthird-party Network Security Solutionsit's easier to understand why we aredoing certain things the way we aredoing if you understand the coredifferentiators we are bringing to thetable and more importantly understandwhat these differentiators mean to yourightso let me start with listing out the topthree core differentiators in ourapproach to enabling third-party networksecurity insertion on Google Cloudone we are going to provide you aconsistent experience regardless ofwhether you choose to use native networksecurity solution or your choice ofthird-party network security solutiontwowe are going to enable you to expressyour network security intent as a policyrather than as a network rules orrouting rules and threewe are going to ensure that thedeployment and operation of third-partyappliances is as simple as consuming asa service experiencenow let me get into the details of whyeach of these differentiators isrelevant for youso let's start with Cloud nativeexperiencewe had Cloud firewall that providedlayer 3 and layer 4 protectionsand Cloud firewall comes with a lot offeature-rich capabilities such ashierarchical policy support IEM backedsecurity taxfirewall insights and many more right sowhen we wanted to introduce our nativenext gen firewall solution we extendedthe cloud firewall policy language toenable you to express your intent ofwhat traffic needs to go for advancedsecurity inspections so when it cametime to introduce third party insertionwe retain the same policy constructs andthe language so that you are able toconsistently Express the intent of whichof your traffic needs to be delivered toyour deployed setup third partyfirewalls for advanced deep packetinspectionwhat this means is all the featurecapabilities of cloud firewall areenabled to you regardless of whether youchoose to use first party Solutions orthe third party solutionthis also means going through Regulatoryand compliance hardits becomes a wholelot simplerwhen it comes time for your next networksecurity audit there are only twodetails you need to share with yourauditors one obviously is the securitypolicy that you implemented on yourthird party firewalls and twoCloud firewall rules which gives yourAuditors a comprehensive picture ofwhich of your traffic is being protectedby layer 3 and layer 4 rules and whichof your application traffic is beingsent to the your deployed set ofthird-party firewalls for advancedrepacket inspectionstaying on the theme of inheriting therich feature capabilities of cloudfirewallthe native integration with firewallinsights allows you to getrecommendations on how you can optimizeyour traffic selection rules to save oncost and to improve your networksecurity posturecoming to the second differentiator theability to express your network intentas a policy rather than networking rulesallows you to seamlessly insertthird-party next-gen firewalls into yourexisting Brownfield applicationdeployments without going through anynetwork re-architecture orreconfigurationthe intent that you express is enforcedat the workload what this means is evenif this workload moves to a differentPPC different project or if thisworkload spins down and comes back up ata later point in timeyou can be rest assured that the policywill always follow the workloadlastly we are working with our next-genfirewall partners to allow you toimplement micro segmentation into yourcloud workloadsthe intent that you express in the cloudfirewall rules is automatically sharedwith the with your deployed set offirewall appliances so that you don'thave to express the intent in multipleplaces the only additional detail thatyou have to express on the firewalls iswhat Security Services you want toenforce on your selected trafficso far I've covered how we made it easyfor you to select what traffic needsAdvanced inspection but then we alsounderstand that deploying these firewallappliances at scale is often challengingso we went one step furtherwe are working on this network serviceintegration manager that will provideyou guided workflows to discover deployand operate third-party network securityappliancesthe approach we have taken is we willprovide you a sas-like consumptionexperience while you retain the fullcontrol over the life cycle of theappliances what this means is you get todecide which version of software youwant to run on these firewalls whatsecurities or signature updates that youwant to install on them when you want toupgrade them or downgrade themand all of this would be enabled throughEasy Button approachmost importantlyyou will now have a single dashboardViewto manage and monitor all yourthird-party deploymentsbefore I close out I want to emphasizethat Innovations like this are not builtin isolationwe are very grateful to our next-genfirewall Partners Cisco 49 checkpointand Palo Alto networks Who providedvaluable guidance feedback and input tomake sure that we are building the mosteasy to consume experience when it comesto network security on Google Cloud[Music]foreign"
