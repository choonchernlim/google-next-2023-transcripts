and you have left thatmoment inspired and kind of eager to diginto the details a little bit more whichis what we're here to do today my nameis Candace Carlson and I'm the head ofour North America industry marketingteam here at Google Cloud which reallymeans that I spend my time thinkingabout Cloud capabilities and how theycan drive business outcomes for ourcustomers across Industries in a numberof different use cases I have spent aton of time in retail with our retailcustomers and so I'm incredibly excitedtoday to be joined by Urban Outfittersand newly to really dig in and talkabout how they are thinking about demandforecasting in industry and inventoryLogistics and you we have this word inour description of modern demandforecasting and so we'll talk a littlebit about how they're approaching thattodayfrom the large established brands thatthey have of anthropology and FreePeople to newer emerging subscriptionmodels like newly so we're gonna we'regonna kind of cover all of it todaybefore we get too far into it we willspeak on stage here for about 20-25minutes and then we have this microphonein the middle and we really reallyencourage you to ask questions thisshould be a dialogue hopefully as wespeak it inspires ideas for you soplease we'll get to that moment andwe'll call it out but know that thatmicrophone is in the middle for you tomake sure everyone can hear yourquestionsso with that I'd love to welcome Alanrosenwinkle director of data science atUrban and Jack Delaney Senior reportingand analytics manager at newly so thankyou both for being here and for makingthe trip now I'm gonna I should havedone the stool thing first hold onumso before we get into our conversationshere just a quick raise of hands howmany people in the audience are thinkingabout inventory Logistics or demand Forkforecasting specifically it's on yourmind awesome and of those hands raisedhow many of you have startedimplementing AI or some form of AIcapabilities within how you're thinkingabout solving thatwonderful okay perfect so we're gonnaget right into that so Alan why don'tyou tell us a little bit about both yourrole at Urban and the urban family ofBrands as well sure thanks Candicethanks for having us thanks everybodyfor coming uh it's great to be hereum so as Candace mentioned uh urbn theparent company uh that Jack and I workfor are a portfolio of global uh fashionbrands anthropology free people and theUrban Outfitters brand are our brick andmortar and e-commerce sort ofconventional retail Brands and thennewly is our newest circular fashionbrand which Jack will talk aboutum I had up the data science and machinelearning engineering teams at Urbanacross all of our Brands[Music]umwewework across newly and the other brandsstay mostly if I always focused onexcuse me our retail Brands Jack will becovering our newly Brands[Music]umthe Urban's uhumfulfillment Network distribution Networkspans across North America and Europe asyou'll hear in a bit it's going throughsome modernizations we're excited totalk about thatumand uh like that's about it I'll have totalk about himself yeah thanks forhaving us Candaceum so yeah to back up and talk aboutnewly a little bit Nui is a subscriptionclothing rental business uh that the rbnbrand launched in 2019. uh so what thatmeans is you pay 98 a month to rent sixor more items uh and we have Brands likeincluding our sister Brands so UrbanOutfitters anthropology free people uhbut also other brands so we have stufflike Levi's for love and lemons a GoldieEtc and this really arose in 2019 inamidst you know the rise of subscriptionboxes in general so things like Birchboxfor makeupum or like even Stitch fixing clothingthe difference in opportunity that wesaw is where Stitch fix it really likeuses Ai and you know stylusrecommendations to pick clothing for youour customers really preferred autonomyand picking so truly taking like theshopping experience and making it amonthly subscription service andadditionally really solving for aparadox that a lot of our customers havebeen facing which is you want to keepyour wardrobe fresh but you want to doit in an environmental a sustainable wayso having to constantly purchase newstuff will need to wear it once is notenvironmentally or financiallysustainable so new is really analternative that lets you keep a freshwardrobe but also not spend a fortune orharm the planet in doing soum and then we've really like to getback to your question about logisticsCandace we really have enjoyed you knowrapid subscriber growth So currently weonly have one fulfillment center in thePhiladelphia area but we recentlyacquired more space in Kansas Cityum so we've been looking to expand therewhich is kind of what we'll be talkingabout today um and then about myself soJack Delaney I manage the reporting andanalytics functions at newly soreporting is business intelligence youknow building building data pipelinesgetting data in looker and doing datavisualization and then on the analyticsside it really similar to their pointteam it's all about making decisionswith data so we partner with allcross-functional Partners to to use datato just inform decisions as the businessscalesawesome lovely well again thank you bothfor making the trip out here and fortaking time to chat with us todayum so let's start a little bit let'sback up a little bit let's go into theway way back machine and Alan talk to usabout the pre-machine learning world aturbn sureum it's a little history about UrbanOutfitters Urban's first store opened in1970 and was brick and mortar until ourfirst uh digital website uh was launchedin 1998. I don't know how many of youremember 1998 in here but that was veryearly in the e-commerce Revolutionum so Urban had a long history of premachine learning e-commerceumand sort of machine learning again inurban I've kind of grown up togethercontemporaneouslyumwe Urban uses a lot of third-partyvendors for some of our ml applicationsso you know companies I'm sure you guyshave heard of Salesforce Blue Yonder acertify a company called visance forproduct attribution you know and andmany others and then really on acase-by-case basis we in-house some mlcapabilities that we either can't findin the market from vendors or we haveyou know specific needsum recently the launch of Urban's newfulfillment center in Kansas city hasreally driven us to build out anin-house data science practice inlogistics and fulfillment and we'll talka little bit about later but as you canimagine you know adding another node tothem to a two node Network to make athree node North American Network aspretty dramatically increase thecomplexity of the network and also theopportunity for for optimizationuh so that's that's kind of the historyof the company and where we are todayleading up to really get into machinelearning for inventory optimization yepyep so right from the bat almost I meanI know brick and mortar was obviouslybefore Ecom but you're having to dealwith inventory across different channelssome in the store some online kind ofsorting all of that out Jack I thinkwhat's interesting about newly right isthat you've kind of started in themachine learning world and always withinventory optimization probablyattacking that problem a littledifferently so talk to us about newlyspecifically yeah definitely solaunching in 2019 you know we kind of weknew that was something we were going toneed to to strongly uh build and to tackonto what Alan was saying about allthese vendors they're definitely greatbut they they attack more traditionalretail problems the subscription rentalclothing business is just different kindof the profit structure is justdifferent the customer experience isdifferent so those don't all work forNui so they knew they were we knew theywere things that we were going to needto build in-house so on the machinelearning side we we have a couple of keyapplications currently the first ofwhich is recommendations so we have a Ithink it's over 18 000 styles that areactive on site right now so that's a lotso to help customers kind of find whatthey need we built an in-houserecommender system that's different fromtraditional e-commerce which is reallykind of trying to drive a sale for uswe're trying to inform you know productDiscovery freshness really how do wesurface some of those 18 000 styles thatspeak to you but maybe don't speak toeveryone else so that was our firstin-house ml application we also when yourent those six plus items you have theoption to purchase them so we built anin-house pricing algorithm thatdetermines the profit optimal pricewhile still meeting some businessobjectives and then more recently we'vebeen focused on the kind of the conceptof demand forecasting inventoryoptimization and moving toward that dualnode Networkyeah so I might like if you don't mindbecause I know I know a little bit aboutthe story Jack and I were in a webinarlast night this is very different than awebinarum but we we talked a little bit aboutcsat and how you thought about customersatisfaction and kind of the tie withthe technology choices you make and whatyour customers need and won and Ithought it was super interesting becauseyou noticed that csat was lagging on thewest coast but it was due to shippinglike it was directly tied to inventoryand shipping like any any thoughts Iknow the Kansas City operation kind ofhas helped with that but any commentsthere on kind of how how your customerinteractions help you make choicestechnology wise yeah definitely so foranyone who doesn't know csat customersatisfaction just a rating one to fivewhat we noticed what Candace was sayingwhen we dug in is that it was lower onthe west coast and dialing into theproblems it really is isolated toshipping speed so that one DistributionCenter that we have outside Philadelphiaservicing the entire country you have toimagine it's not going to be not themost cost effective or time effective tosend stuff out to West Coast customersand then this is a monthly subscriptionservice so when you're ordering you knowone-off orders from Amazon it's annoyingif it arrives a day or two late but withmonthly subscription service you're kindof you're paying for that 30-day periodso the time that you have with clothesat home is very important so in order toattack that in order to address customerexperience we're really hoping to tothat this additional Warehouse in Kansascity is going to let us give customersmore inventory but also faster shippingspeeds so it should be a win-win on thecustomer side there and that's just oneexample but we really have you knowcustomer first I think that's importantwith every subscription model you'rereally asking people to reevaluate everymonth if they want to renew thatcontract so you have to put the customerfirst like they're reassessing theirengagement with newly each month so it'spretty criticalAlan I'm curious from like the urbnbrands in general like what are the topinventory challenges that you're facingtoday like like just kind of at themacro level yeahumup until recently before we launched theKansas City fulfillment center we had abasically a two node North AmericanNetwork a fulfillment center in RenoNevada and another in LancasterPennsylvania andum our the demand for our productstypically spreads across the east coastof West Coast so it was fairly simple tofigure out where the inventory should beto match demand from the coasts as we'velaunched the Kansas City fulfillmentcenter that that that challenge of howdo you distribute your inventory acrossthe three node Network becomes a lotmore complicated because now you havethis new fulfillment note in the middleof the country that can adequatelyfulfill either Coast right so there'ssort of a competition between gettingthe inventory to the coasts and gettingthose orders shipped to Coastalcustomers as quickly as possible versuskeeping the inventory in the center ofthe country whereyou're you're mitigating the risk ofhaving a shipment have to go from anEast Coast fulfillment center to a WestCoast customer which is slow andexpensiveumis that sort of where we've where we'vebuilt our ML and sort of data sciencecapability and starting to build thingslikediscrete event simulators to to answerkind of what-if scenarios you know if wehad laid down inventory using a certainmethodology you know how would that haveimpacted fulfillment cost and speed tocustomer on historical data to help tohelp arm Executives to make gooddecisions with the in these verycounter-intuitive and non-intuitive uhproblem space yeah and you mentionedExecutives there just for a minute butlike who are your like key line ofbusiness kind of folks that you'reworking with across the organization arethere certain departmentsEtc that yeahum Urban at urbn the brands are runum quite independently sure so eachbrand is really a core stakeholder theytake the the piano and then there's alogistics organization that manages theactual warehouses that I would say issort of our primary customer and thenthere's our organization which is partof like what we call Urban technologywhich is a shared organization acrossall of the brands so uhit's it's uhthe organizational structure does impactyou know how you execute the work and soI think it's a pretty good situationyeah wonderful and how about biggestchallenges for newly specificspecifically yeah so the the firstchallenge we encountered is you know uhthe the lack of space in our currentWarehouse so we're building the secondKansas City Warehouse long term uh toenable subscriber growth but we alsowanted to retrofit our existingDistribution Center uh to support moreinventory so in order to retrofit itneed to do construction and constructioninvolves a loss of the current space youhave so our first kind of problem herewas how do we identify product that'snot going to rent over the next severalmonths that we feel safe taking out ofour orderable inventory to a customerand the key a key difference to kind ofexplain here between newly a rentalsubscription business and a traditionalretailer is for a traditional retailerwhen you bring in your start of seasoninventory so like all your all your youknow heavy winter coats you have apretty concrete timeline of when youwant to sell those you want to sell themthroughout the winter and not hold thatinventory until next year so you canaccomplish that you know ideally viafull price sales but if not you havemarkdowns as a way to deplete thatinventory by the end of the winter hernew is different so newly we want tokeep those winter coats for next yearthe following year and the year afterthat like we're trying to create a longgarment life cycle where it gets manyturns and many customers are able to torent that winter coat so it means wehave a lot of inventory that's notnecessarily productive year round soit's easy at first to kind of justrule-based heuristics okay if we needmore space in the warehouse let's takeall the cold weather stuff and box it upbut we need to clear a lot of space sothat's where you know machine learningreally is helpful when you're trying tomake those decisions across 18 000Styles how do you pick where to slightlytrim the excess inventory but not harmthe customer experience so we were ableto use a demand forecast to kind ofpredict you know how much is this goingto rent in the next four months and thendo we have excess inventory that we cantemporarily move out of the warehouse tocreate space so in partnership with likeour buying and planning team we wentthrough many iterations of like wherewhere do we have little bits of excessinventory that might be hard for us tosee but this as models you know verysuccessful at predicting rental demandso it's kind of our initial use case andwhat we're what we're working toward nowis how do we stand up that secondWarehouse that Kansas City warehouse andpre-place inventory so take it out ofour existing Warehouse in Philadelphiaand move it to Kansas City withoutimpacting the customer experienceso what we're trying to do now is youknow what's not going to run what can wemove ahead of time and then what aremost popular products that we know weneed to get to Kansas City but we don'tnecessarily feel comfortable taking themout of orderable inventory for ourexisting customer base and how are wegoing to get it there so that's the verythorny problem we're trying to solve nowis you know how do you how do you shiftthat inventory without impacting thecustomerand you mentioned the demand forecastingmodel how long has that been in placeum we probably started that about a yearyear and a half ago and then have gonethrough like several several iterationsto kind of pick groups of inventory tomove out of the Philadelphia Warehouseinto storage and then ultimately to movesome of that back because now we've gonethrough several seasons so yeah alsousing the demand forecaster to figureout what needs to be brought back firstright right jack you mentioned newly islooking to get you know the most lifeout of our garment do you happen to knowwhat the longest lifetime of ourgovernment has beenthey're definitely so there's somethingthat was purchased on it's about 34th35th rent so it's many turns and andthen ultimately got purchased so that'slike an ideal story right is we got 35months of someone renting it and then itfound a forever home from someone whotruly loved it I would guess thosethings have been rented more than thatand just have the purchase I don't knowoff the top of my head though yeahokay so let's talk a little bit you'vementioned some partners and you knowkind of alluded to the tech stack a bitbut let's let's talk about theinfrastructure that's actually involvedin your inventory management and I knowit's a little different across both somaybe Alan we start with you sureum yeah as you can imagine the inventorymanagementsystems for the e-commerce brands areit's pretty substantial so you'retalking about all the systems involvedin The Upfront supply chain of gettingthe inventory to the stores and into thewebsite so merchandising systemsplanning allocation those are allactually going through our modernizationright now at Urban I think we justannounced publicly that we chose 09 asour provider for those systems we'revery excited aboutum having all those systems live in oneplace and all the functionality have oneentry pointexcuse me especially for machinelearning and data science so we'reexcited about thatumon the machine learning sidewe we traditionally have used GoogleCloud composer so airflow for a lot ofour ml Ops orchestration we've alsoleveraged a lot of the other Googletools like kubeflow cubefoot pipelinesvertex AI et cetera I'm sure many of youare familiar with but it's been it'sbeen really good being on gcp and havingpretty much any tool we need right therein the Google ecosystemany nuances for newly uh yeah so newlysince it launched more recently we kindof had the ability to set up what Ithink is a very intelligent design sowe're gcp everything and a lot of oursystems are built in-house so likethere's there's a you know rentalmanagement system there aren't reallyvendors that do that for you and we havesuch specific use cases we really needfull control of that system so all ofthat data gets streamed into bigqueryvia Apache Kafka and something I loveabout you know doing analytics at newlyis at my last company they have sincemoved to bigquery but while I was therethey had like on-premise SQL server andwhenever you wanted historical data solike inventory data by day what I wouldhave to do is set up a scheduled querythat runs every morning and snapshots ofthat data and so if I need 30 days worthof data I'd set a calendar reminder for30 days and then kind of go back andanalyze with how we have data set up youknow because of bigquery scale and costwe just send everything there and now Ican create that same timeline for morethan just 30 days like for all ofnewly's history anda couple of minutes to write the queryand run it so it's been really useful inthe analytics side to be able to reallycreate you know full timelines of dataand conduct much better analyzeshonestly because 30 days usually isn'tenough to get like a full year orwhatever so it's been really nice thatdata is kind of like a first-classcitizen at newly and we're able to makea lot of decisions with data that wayand then on the reporting side of myteam so they stand upETL pipelines so we have kind of anin-house solution currently but it'sorchestrated with Google Cloud composerApache airflow and then we have lookerand looker Studio sitting on top of alot of that for data visualization andthen lastly we honestly use a lot ofspreadsheets so a lot of Google Sheetsthey're a great collaborative tool greatfor sharing stuff cross-functionally soyou know it's one thing to have like ademand forecasting model in a notebookbut to get stakeholder buy-in you reallyneed to like speak in their language andthey're always in spreadsheets so givingthem the ability to kind of do their owncalculations do their own filtering andreally see the output to the model is ispretty key so we're in Google Sheets allthe time as wellwhat would you all say like so if you'remaking these changeshoist to goor you know you're you're raising a newdemand forecasting model what are someof like the big big wins within theorganization that you've had sinceyou've kind of started thinking this wayemploying new technology and then alsoI'm just curious like how do you sharethose wins I think there's probablygreat things happening in the originalBrands there's great things happeningwith newly like how do youyour team cross-functionally how are youhow are you identifying the big wins andthen sharing themthat's a good questionum I would I would say the big onesespecially as it relates to Google areone just sort of obvious but being on astrong cloud provider with all the toolsum I would say bigquery specifically hascome a really long way since we startedusing it I don't know four or five yearsagoum point where I you know it has everyfeature that we would needum so it's sort of obvious but I can'tunderestimate or understate howimportant it is to have everything allin one place and I have to deal withum a lot of complexity of Integrationsum the other one I'll say is thatGoogle is a lot moreof a partner and then just a cloudprovider for us so we spent a lot oftime engaging with Google and Googleexperts on things like demandforecasting and ml Ops infrastructureand you know talking about road maps andwhat's the plan for vertex Ai and vertexAI forecasting and protects I havepipelines Etc so we've we've reallygotten a lot ofsort of under the radar value from beinga Google Cloudadoptee Beyond just the software and theinfrastructure as far as a questionabout how to how to communicate thosethose the wins it's it's tough becauseeverybody comes from a different placein terms of their knowledge ofparticularly machine learning and datascience and some people are reallyreally strong and educated and want toknow in the leads details about you knowwhat the what the value proposition wasand others really just want to know thesummary and don't you know aren't notthat they're interested but don't havethe time to spend to get up to speed onyou know how to demand forecastingalgorithms work so it's it's often achallenge to to purpose build themessage to the audience yeah but some ofthe wins that you guys have gotten havebeen like no-brainer and very tangiblelike to me the batching algorithm stuffso like optimizing pick pads in thewarehouse and just kind of identifyingable to cut you know labor Time by Xperson is like a really clear messagethat doesn't need to focus on the moretechnical stuff so it definitely variesproject by project how like communicablethat is yeah and are you like as teamsyou're probably searching for those Iwould I would assume those kind of statscan also help justify future Investmentsmore engagement across the teams rightso you're constantly looking for eitherI would it's probably operationalefficiency that's happening internallyor customer satisfaction right are thosekind of the two pillars absolutely thatmakes sense any additional like waysthat you're analyzing wins from thenewly side of the houseum I think as far as like gcp is itreally is just how open bigquery is toletting us pull full streams of datalike very quicklyum so those have been the big ones forus yeahyeah I mean so breaking down The Dailydata silos fundamentally having onespecific place so that when you arebuilding models or trying to like makesome decisions you're not having to goto multiple sources exactly everythingin one nice neat clean Place yeah yeahso if you were to do this all over againif you were new to a new subscriptioncompanybuilding a new e-commerce experience orthinking about inventory Logistics at afresh company what advice would you giveretailers as they kind of approach thisproblemuh yeah I'll take a stab at it um Iwould say there's three big onestwo of them are kind of obvious one isjust getting your data in a good placebefore you start to think about machinelearning and optimization like ittrying to start a data science ormachine learning project before yourdata isin a good place and you understand it isa isa recipe for disaster just you spin yourwheels and so many iterations onquestions for you know the teams thatcreate the data so that one isdefinitely just doing a really strongaudit of all your data before you getstarted the second is organizationalsupportum at a company like Urban like wetalked about how there's a lot ofdifferent stakeholders really makingsure that all those stakeholders arealigned on what the objectives are ofyour project before you get startedum has has we've found to be key it'seasy to get yourself in a situationwherewhere stakeholders have differentobjectives and it's impossible to meetall at one so kind of getting that allaligned and converge up frontum the third one that's specific todemand forecasting and sort of logisticsinventory optimization isI think a lot of people tend to startthinking about machine learning anddemand forecasting specifically as thefirst place to think about inventoryoptimization when I think that's almostthe last place that you need to thinkabout and the first place is theoptimization side of the problem andeven a very simple rudimentary forecastwith a good Optimizer can oftenoutperform a really good forecast with aterrible Optimizer and I think thethethe skill sets of a traditional datascience are are much more in theforecasting space I think it'srelatively easy to find someone who hasexperience doing forecasting but it'snot that easy to find someone that'sdone robust optimization and there arevery few vendors and open source toolsthat really do a great job with what youmight call it decision science ordecision optimization you know actuallyI'll plug one a startup I think ycombinator19 or 20 called next move which is Ithink from what I've seen as the bestvendor for trying to do uh things likekubernetes and kubeflow pipelines havedone for ML apps for what you might calldecision apps they provide like asoftware as a service platform for doingoptimization so you bring your model andthey try to help you with theoptimization and that's really criticalbecause the optimization piece of it isis a challengesense any extra advice from you jack uhyeah so I'll also go with three thingsum the first one I would say is reallybeing skeptical of kind of the outputsof of algorithms at first so partneringwith you know your business stakeholderswho do have a lot of contextum at least an organization of newlysize data scientists might work onpricing inventory optimizationrecommendations like a lot of differentthings and I I don't think it's fair toexpect that data scientists to be superwell versed in the business context ofeach of those so we really want topartner with the people who know the insand outs and kind of get them to pokeholes get them to ask questions andreally build to a better end result andthen also I'm kind of tacking on to onethat you mentioned but really justgetting like MVP out the door I think Ihave a tendency to try to overcomplicate things or create like thevery perfect solve up front and you'rejust never going to foresee all theproblems that you're going to encounterso I think speedage is getting somethingout there figuring out the blind spotsfiguring out the issues and thenbuilding makes more sense than trying toto upfront make the exact perfect youknow 10-year solutionum and then I guess the last thing iskind of using like natural experimentsor what-if scenarios like you mentionedwhat-if scenarios earlierum there's a lot of research on thislike I think it was 2021 was the theNobel Prize in econ about this butessentially is it's you know Findingcases in your data subsets are slicesum that are almost act like anexperiment um so the example for for usis as we're building the secondWarehouse what's what's customerexperience going to look like with Xthousand Styles and why customers we mayhave never had that exact combo in ourexisting data because we've only had onewarehouse and we grew pretty rapidly butexamples are you can take subsets ofcustomers so maybe like size sixcustomers represent that exact profileor petite customers so that exact stylecount that exact number of subscribersand then what you can get at is how dotheir pause or cancel rates compare tosubscribers who have more inventory attheir disposal or less inventory andreally start to measure you know here'shere's the impact as a baseline when weroll this out of what we expectcustomers to behave with with only thatassortment available so these are reallynice sanity checks I think are thingsthat people in the industry used to notdo but have now become popularized andare really good just kind of backupsecond checksum for for some of your results foroptimizationso yeah this would be my three fantasticwell thank you all so much for joiningus as you go throughout the conferenceyeah let's give them a round of applausepleasethank you so much uh Jack and Alan firstfor spending your time we reallyappreciate it and digging into thedetailsforeign"
