    "transcript": "foreign[Music]Welcome to our sessionthank youwelcome uh to our session on uh drivinggrowth through data Innovation um I haveto say I'm actually blown away I meanwow there's so many people in the roomhere it shows I think what a Hot Topicthis is right now and I think that'sbecause of a convergence of things likeyou know platforms like bigquery withthe emergence of data ecosystems thatenable people to share data much moreeasily combined with some of the recentdevelopments in Ai and particularlygenerative AI that really created thiskind of Perfect Storm of opportunity andof innovation that so many people areinterested inso I have to confess when we wereputting this session together weconsidered making it a partner onlysession that all the speakers here todayare partners of Google clouds they'resoftware companies and I'm so glad wedidn't because when I look at theattendee list there's a whole bunch offolks here from many other Industrieswhich is great and if you wouldn't mindI'd like to do a quick show of hands whohere is from an isv or a data providerokay and who here is from what I wouldconsider a customer another industry youknow banking or retail or something elsewow so by far the majority of you folksaren't in the software business which isfantastic I think there's gonna be anawful lot that you can learn from someof these leaders um that we have onstage todayso my name is Tom I lead a team calledbuilt with bigqueryum here at Google clouds and I have theabsolute pleasure and privilege ofworking with and learning from some ofthe most Innovative companies on theplanet in fact they're about over athousand now of these B2B SAS companiesand data providers who work and buildtheir products on top of bigquery andGoogle's Ai and data cloudincluding 70 of the Gen AI unicorns thatwe hear so much about these daysso for those who don't know what thebuilt with bigquery team is we do twothings we try to accelerate Innovationand monetization and product developmentwith our partners by sharing knowledgeand best practices that we've gleanedworking with Partners all over the worldthe second thing we do is we highlightand we showcase those successes throughthings like blog posts and events likethis so it's it's a real honor today tohost these guys and enable them to sharetheir knowledge and their experienceswith all of you and hopefully create anopportunity for you to learn and theconversation that will extend wellbeyond this sessionSo today we're going to do a couple ofthings we're going to look at some ofthe key patterns that we see whenworking with isvs and data providers allaround the globeand then we're going to spend as muchtime as we can actually talking to someof those isos and data providers thoseleaders in this field so that we canhear their stories and you can learnfrom their experienceso before we do that let me in themoment to Define what I think of as datamonetizationum I think of it as the Art and Scienceof turning data into valueand so you might be wondering why isthat necessary why do we need totransform data to make it valuablesurely data is inherently valuableand I think there's a you know there's acommon misconception perhaps that thatis true you know there's a it's a clicheat this point that data is a valuableresource you know whether it be oil orsand or any of the other analogies thatyou may have heard oflike any analogy these these analogiesaren't perfect but one thing they allhave in common is the idea that as aresource data needs to be transformedinto something of value right it needsto be turned into a product to somedescriptionso when I think of monetization I thinkof productization I think really thosetwo terms are synonymousso what do I mean by that what do wemean by a productizing dataso first and foremost of course you haveto havea process for developing that productright you have to have a developmentprocess that ensures it's fresh it'saccurate it's tested do you have all ofthe things that you would have with anyother software product you need to havea roadmap so that you can ensure thatyou're continuing to give value to yourcustomers as it evolves of course youneed to have a way of Distributing it toget it into the hands of your customersbut perhaps more importantly it needs toprovide some value to customers and thissounds obvious right but so often it'soverlooked you know the idea that youhave a great data set people areautomatically going to consume it justdoesn't bearum you know bear realityso focusing on the value that itprovides to your customers but also ofcourse it needs to provide value to youas a data provider a product thatdoesn't provide value to you isn't goingto have a very long life cycle as aproduct or a very long roadmap and thereare a couple of ways of doing thatthrough direct or indirect monetizationwhich is really where we're going tospend our time todayso just to unpack those Concepts alittle furtheroften overlooked in this whole thing isthe idea of indirect monetization it'sincredibly important to manifests in allsorts of different ways so basicallyit's about creating increaseddifferentiation increased usage increasestickiness of your product through theprovision of these data products withinit sobe in the form of helping you to acquiremore customers or be more effective inconverting those customers fromprospects because of the additionalproducts that you're providing it couldbe that it helps to improve things likeretention and engagement and adoptionwithin your customers because you'reproviding new capabilities they may nothave had before that make certainclasses of users much more engaged withthe product you have already you know agood example is perhaps an e-commercevendor who has a platformproviding information about how thatplatform is performing you know how it'sconverting customers throughout theshopping cycle is a really valuable wayof providing additional value to thosecustomers over and above simply the actof providing the e-commerce platform itmay provide a competitivedifferentiation so that it helps you tocompete more effectively when you're ina head-to-head with some of yourcompetitorsimportantly it can be a way of provingvalue to your customers again in thee-commerce exampleyou might launch a new feature thatenables you to a B test two differentflowsby by allowing the customer tounderstand the difference that you'remaking and the conversion rate you'reproving the value that this additionalfeature has provided to them andtherefore the value that they get fromsubscribing to your product soincredibly important way of provingvalue and also and this relates more tothe the data sharing ecosystems but theidea that you can create increased go tomarket alignment so if you're talking tofor example a Google seller one of thefield sales reps here for a customer thefact that you're sharing data with theircustomer which generates additionalconsumption within their tenant is agreat reason to have a conversationoften overlooked it's one of thebenefits hereso of course the most obvious way thatyou monetize is directly and there are anumber of ways that you can think aboutthis as well for example you know one ofthe decisions that you'll need to makeis whether you're going to bundle thisadditional feature within the coreproduct or perhaps an additional tierfor example you know your basic versionmay not have a data product attached toit but the pro version may do and theEnterprise version may have an evengreater level of capability that youprovide to them all you can have is astandalone product something that yousell independently of the main productas cross-sell or an upsell you've got tothink about things like how do you wantto charge for it is it a subscription isit pay as you go do you do even aPerpetual license and how do you thinkabout that do you provide a flat ratedo you pay per user per month you do itbased on usage how much consumption howmuch data they're scanning how much datathey're storingEtcanother important way that you canmonetize with directly with customers isby opening up new user groups withinthat organization so for example theremight be a whole team of analysts anddata scientists within your customerbase that doesn't have a reason to usethe product right now they don't need tobuy a license but by adding in theseadditional capabilities you might openup a whole new area of analysts and datascientists who can't wait to get theirhands on the data but haven't had theopportunity to until this pointand then lastly of course you can usethe expertise that you've built workingwith many customers across your industryacross your vertical to provideProfessional Services to them Consultingto help optimize what they're doingusing the data you're providing to themto be even more effective using yourproductsthe key thing to highlight here ofcourse is that these products theseapproaches aren't mutually exclusive youwill combine them you will choose tobundle some of these capabilities withyour core product offering and you willchoose probably to charge for some ofthem separately and that may be ajourney to embark on your first releasemay be about giving them additionalvalue within the product monetizingindirectly and then it may be that overtime you start to add on more and morefeatures that become far more valuableand therefore warrant a separate skewso when we work with all of thesePartners we've come to identify a rangeof different patterns that people usehigh level patterns that we see over andover and again and these are the waysthatthese guys are using a platform to driveadditional value additional monetizationso I'm going to break these down for youeffectively you think of these as ninetried and tested way of drivingadditional value or driving additionalmonetizationof course is the idea of an analytics adata analytics as a service all of theseproducts to some extent rely on the ideaof having a data set that you can querythat you can explore that you can gainInsight fromin addition to that we see two types ofadditional pattern the firstis what we think of as core applicationpatterns so these are where you'readding additional capability onto thatcore analytics data set and the othertype really relates to something justmore recent which is the data sharingecosystem so taking the data out of thecore application and sharing eitherdirectly with the customer or to someother third partyso first of those is what we think of asembedded AI now we're not going to coverthis particular Topic in too much detailtoday and the reason for that is becausethere is an excellent session tomorrowthat this focuses exclusively on thisbut this use case is really about theidea ofum layering on top of that analyticsthat data analytics application thatyou've developed and using it to drivefar more far richer data experiences nowof course we have the looker productwhich is ideally suited to this itenables visualization through charts andother visual elements but also thingslike alerts and it provides a commonwhat we call a semantic layer that sitson top of these data sources so you canintegrate with things like bigquery youcan integrate with other data sourcesthat you have and create this Richvisualization bi layer which is embeddedwithin your product so a really fast andeasy way of driving additional valueusing effectively the sameinfrastructure that you have todaythe second of these is what we think ofas alphabet Integrations there are acouple of these that we see over andover again one of them is integratingwith Google marketing Cloud Googlemarketing platform so things like adsand Google analytics Etc and you canhear some of our speakers talk aboutthat today the other area we see anawful lot of this is integrating withEarth engine our geospatial partners oursustainability partners are huge usersof this capability but there are manyothers things like integrating withmerchant center if you're an e-commercevendor integrating your Merchant catalogso real Rich opportunity there and veryunique to Google these are opportunitiesthat just aren't as easy if you'rerunning on a different Cloud if you'renot using bigquery it's a reallypowerful way a very quickly deliveringadditional valuethe nextof course Ai and mla year ago I would probably have beenstanding here talking about the powerfulpredictive capabilities of AI and mltoday most of the conversations we haveinevitably about generative Ai and it'spower to generate but whatever the storyis this is an incredibly important wayof you driving additional value for yourcustomers using the data that you haveand then lastly in the core aggregatethe core application use cases is whatwe think of as activation you know sooften we provide information to userssome organizations we work with takethat further and they actually use thatinformation to drive activity to driveaction within the application itself andagain some of our partners are going totalk about this todayso if we switch over to the other sideand we talk about some of these datasharing use cases the first of thosethat we think of is what we call thedata twin and what we mean by that isthat you might be an isv again I go backto my analogy or my example of the theCommerce vendor who is uh sharing thecustomer they have customer data rightthey have a whole bunch of informationabout transaction and sales and thattype of thing the customer finds thatdata really valuable and they want tocombine it with the rest of their dataestate they might have CRM data theymight have inventory data and they wantto bring it all together so it cancreate that 360 degree view of theirsupply chain of their customer Etc andso we can do that through a number ofways these days a lot of what we do isin product codes analytics Hub whichenables them to share without copyingthat data into the customer's bigqueryinstance very very easilythe next is really an extension of thatand we've seen this much more in thelast couple of months has been reallygrowing which is the idea of a datacleaning room so when you start to sharedata particularly around customers Etcbut sometimes related to supply chainsyou need to be able to share privatedata sets securely in a way that enablesmultiple parties to look at just theamount of data that is appropriate forthem to you know one of the examplesthat's often given is a retailer whowants to share Coca-Cola statistics withCoke and Pepsi statistics with Pepsi butdoesn't want to share the other wayaround so you can create a data cleanroom to do that equally if you're doingmarketing and you want to gain access tosome additional information about acustomer but without sharing pii datayou can use a data clean room so areally powerful way of augmenting thedata twin use case and something thatwas just announced this week at a GoogleCloud nextso the next of these is what we think ofas data publisher and we've got Dan andBradstreet with us today who are youknow a fantastic Exemplar of this butthis is different to data twin in thatrather than sharing the customers databack with themthese are organizations that are sharingdata sets that are proprietary to themthe corpuses of data that they'vecurated refined and made available tocustomers uh to buy and so reallypowerful use case there and somethingthat may resonate with many of you ifyou'resitting on valuable data that you maychoose to to do something withI think it was Data warehouses serviceso this is where you are sharingumyour customer wants to do more they wantto be able to perhaps do some moredetailed analysis they might have have aneed for reports that you can't provideand they may want to even bring in theirown data it's a very simple way of thatis doing that is to create a project forthem to deploy bigquery perhaps even putsome looker in there to deploy datathat's useful to them and then give themaccess so you're providing really afully functional very rich datawarehouse experience but without havingto uh for them to become a Google Cloudcustomer it resides in your tenancy sothose are the nine patterns that wethat we work with here within the builtwith bigquery team and it is now mypleasure to welcome on stage my panel ofspeakerswho are going to share some of theirexperience withwelcome Andy and Leeand Spencer and Aaronsoto get us started I'm going to ask youeach to just introduce yourself to spenda minute or so telling who you are andwho you know a little bit about yourcompany so start with you Andy all rightwell thank you Tom and Google Cloud forhosting this and everyone attending I'mAnnie scree VP of product at exabeamsecurity operations platform we helplarge organizations defect detect defendand defeat attacks that start bothinternally and externally we do this bydelivering a modular platform that helpsus meet organizations where they are intheir maturity Journey this typicallystarts with Cloud scale security logmanagement being able to ingest a largeamount of data making it available forsearch reporting and detection we canlayer on additional capabilities likeour Advanced AI based Behavior analyticsthat normalizes and learns the behaviorof every user and device to identifyanomalies to root out threats andfinally we offer automation soorganizations can automate the fullthreat detection investigation andresponse life cycle for more consistentand repeatable security outcomesthank you thank you hi everyone I'm LeeLuxembourg from dun and Bradstreet Imanage co-innovation with Google cloudand we've seen a lot of that since we'vestarted our partnership done andBradstreet started 180 something yearsago as a business credit agency and soonrealized that the underlying data forthat business credit and the sourcesthat it came from was value of itselfand the insights that came of it so wesince then quickly realized we willcreate you know data as a product and beable to sell that as value for customersbut also fuel SAS offerings in spaces ofsales and marketing third-party risk andcompliance and also Master datamanagement for customers across allsizesgreat I'm Spencer Pingree head-upsoftware architecture for optimizelyoptimizely is a suite of products builtfor marketers and developers to

thesecond is Commerce with our configuredCommerce products for B2B and b2c andthen the last which I'm going to spendall the time talking about today is ourexperimentation products which are forweb experimentation for on-site andencode and feature experimentation forflag based experimentationthanks Vinceand I'm Aaron bulkins I am a VP ofproduct at live ramp and live ramp isthe partner of choice for identitydriven data collaboration for theworld's most Innovative companies wehelp companies really understand theircustomers through the power of data andwe help them interact with theircustomers and and guide the customerJourneyending in the best results for both themand their and their customersthank you Aaronso let's jump into the the conversationso by now you're all familiar with thisuh this model I want to start off withreally the core of this and Andy and Leeit'd be great to hear from you Andyyou've always been built on bigqueryum Lee you've you've decided to movethere more recently in the last coupleof years so I'd love to hear from bothof you about why you made that decisionand and how it's worked out for you soperhaps starting with you Andy yeahabsolutely we we started our journeywith bigquery about two and a half yearsago exabeam started out as an on-premiseappliance-based company and so when wewanted to make that re-platforming shiftto Cloud we we chose bigquery and therewere two primary use cases that we werereally looking to solve first is wewanted to make sure that we were able tohave a platform level data store so wecould collect normalize all of the dataonce and then monetize that datamultiple times through differentapplications and insights that weprovide one of those primary drivers wasour security analytics capability so weneeded a bigquery or a data store thatcould scale to drive the detectioncapabilities that our customers expectwe offer multiple different analyticsengines and actually yesterday we werenamed the tech partner of the year forsecurity analytics from Google Cloudso that was a big driver for us was thatplatform data store secondly was ourability to give our customers access tothat data store to query it duringsecurity investigations and there were anumber of really key use cases there oneis we needed customers to have theability to ingest all of the data thatthey cared about they needed to be ableto retain that data for up to 10 yearsbased on compliance and investigationneeds and they need to be able to accessthat data at scale quickly when you'redoing a security investigation you havea breach you can't afford to run a queryand wait 30 minutes both for data thatjust came in and that data that's 10years oldwe also needed to make sure thatcustomers had the ability to craftcomplex queries access and the the rightinsights and aggregate that datathe last one we needed was we needed tomake sure that the solution scaled basedon the access on demand when you're inan incident or a breach you may have 10xthe number of queries and people usingthat service we need to make sure thatservice is highly available when ourcustomers need it the most uh bigquerywas the choice for us it's really beendelighting our customers in terms of theapplications we're delivering and it'shelped our engineering team deliver newfeatures and applications much fasterwithout having to worry about where do Iget the data how do I format it andmanage the data life cyclethank you Andy Lee and for us I meanmuch like Andy's response you knowsecurity infrastructure and scale isimportant for Dunham Bradstreet not onlyour 180 years of data but you knowbusiness information for over 525million companies across the globe andso having one place where all thatinformation can work together andefficiently with something that wehaven't had in a long time and really abig driver in our decision to move notjust our data but all of our platformsto Google cloud in doing so we are ableto fuel our products our data our SASofferings our models for the ourcustomers that use our data so much moreefficiently and consistently and withoutthe data latency issues and just findingthat as we you know continue to migrateand make everything you know consistentin one place where the customers arealready reaching out to us to sayclearly things are they're betterthey're faster they're cleaner you knowthank you so much and so it's a greatpartnership we have at Google Cloudfantastic thank you Lee so in order tosave us a bit of time here I only groupsome of these categories togetherbecause some of them there's someoverlap here and so I want to start offwith you Spencer and to talk about acouple of things you know I know youhave some deep Integrations with GoogleCloud Google marketing Cloudum but also by Design you know from dayone you particularly with the productsyou're talking about today you've alwaystaken action within those products thatby Design so I'd love you to talk alittle bit more about thatuh yeah so part of experimentation isalways affecting the experience so wealwaysum any output of a result an experimentis always a change in action for theexperience of the userum so that action and activation is partof kind of our core product as itrelates to Integrations into the broaderalphabet anybody that's dealt withmarketing or martech industry knows youalways get the question how does thiscompare to Google analytics and how doyou how do you integrate better withAdWords and analytics and and kind ofthat stackand so two things that we've been doingwhich kind of on the back end throughbigquery has really helped facilitatedis with Google analytics we can now kindof get common reporting across the twoproducts so that you can view experimentresults within Google analytics and thencoming soon is also the ability to takeaudiences design defined in Googleanalytics and activate them directlythrough experimentation and so thatthose audiences that you define we candeliver all the way through to theexperience and measure the output ofthose experimentsum and maybe the last call I'll makejust because it's relevant at the momentis Google a year ago also decided toSunset a product called Google optimizewhich we've been helping migrate a lotof customers over to if you're on Googleoptimize you have about four weeks tomove off so feel free to sales pitchfeel free to find somebody with anoptimizely badge and we're happy to helpyou uh finish that migration absolutelyso Erin you mentioned that you are theplatform of choice for datacollaboration and so inherently you'reintegrating with other systems there doyou want to say a little bit more abouthow that works for youyeah absolutely we have really deepIntegrations with the Google marketingplatform virtually all of our all oflive ramp products are available throughthe marketing platformand it really Smooths the transition andeases customer onboarding by making itmaking available to patterns that manycustomers are used to available for ourproducts as well and not only does isthere onboarding and purchasingexperience smoother but they're able tooptimize not only budgets but resourceswhen it comes to operating through theGoogle platform with live ramp productsand the fact that you're hosted onGoogle clouds and you're integratingwith Google products creates an enormousamount of benefits associated with thatright because it's all in the same placeabsolutely as everyone anyone knows likethe more consolidation you can do withyour data the easier it is to transacton that data and to have full visibilityacross your entiredata product Suite on um what's going onin your organization and one of thethings that we offer is identityresolution which can break down thosedata silos and give you a true as youwere saying 360 view across all of yourdata especially people-based data sothat you can understandhow your customer is interacting withyou no matter what channel it's throughso Andy I know that you're on a journeyum with your product suite and howdriving active action off the back ofthat data is super important you want tosay a little bit about how you'redriving activation through exopine yeahyou know in security operations it's notenough for us to detect threats andhighlight insights organizations needthat closed-loop experience forremediation and action mostorganizations have upwards of 70different security products deployedthat oftentimes don't talk to each otherand are not integrated they look forSolutions like access beam to integratethose pieces together and Google Cloudoffers us a lot of pre-builtIntegrations into common components froma security perspective to allow us todrive that action and close that Loop alot fasterfantastic thank youso on a switch now to the other side ofthese patterns which is the data sharingpatterns and and everyone on stage hereis doing something in space so I'm goingto pick on a just a subset of folks hereto talk about what they're doing and Ithink Lee I want to start with youbecause obviously at the heart of whatDunham Bridge Street does is share dataand I know you've recently startedadopting analytics Hub as a product soI'd love to hear you talk more aboutthat sure so this is the other half ofthe why right why Google Cloud becauseof the ecosystem and the publishingsupport and opportunity to reallymonetize their data as Tom mentionedearlier both indirectly and directly soby this transformational world wherefile sharing is different than it wasbefore you know delivering files tocustomers is it's a different storyeveryone's in the cloud they want theirdata in the cloud as much of you do soby Able by us being able to put our datain bigquery share via analytics helpcreate this catalog of our dataofferings that we can publish make ityou know apparent and obvious of what wehave have to have customers efficientlyreceive our data through through abigquery in a structured and consistentway also again reducing that latencyissue to reduce their risk making suretheir data is more up to date it's justkind of opened up a new Avenue for usfor not just delivery but being apartner with Google Cloud sales andmarketing opportunities throughanalytics Hub being able to get our nameand information out there to what we doand how we can support customers kind ofadd the layer on top of that formonetization now the data Marketplacethe Google cloud data sorry Google CloudMarketplace being able to sell datathere we're able to help customers whowant to procure through Marketplacespend use commitment they may have andmake it easier to go ahead and procurethe data and obviously ingest it so it'skind of comes full circle for us as adata publisherit's been a real pleasure to be on thatJourney with you as well as we startedto see the transformation that's madeabsolutely so Spencer I think I used youas an example earlier about how somebodymay want totake the rich data that you have andleverage it in their own data warehousetheir own context could you saysomething about you know how yourcustomers use that and how you help themprovide value like that yeah I think alot of our largest customers have entirepractices built around experimentationso they'll have uh teams I think muchlike Andy mentioned earlier andmentioned about the um the teams wantingto get the the data back so they can dowhat they need to do to drive more usesof that data across their organizationand experimentation they may have teamsthat that manage 10 experiments at atime and some that are managing hundredsor thousands of experiments at a timeand so the ability to use that data joinit to their data sets within theirsystems and and create a more a widerarray of experiments or more relevantexperiments is something that's reallyimportant for us to be able to get thatdata that we've collected and share itback to our organization so that theycan do what they need to do with it toleverage it across their their teamsso lastly Aaron there's a couple ofthings here isn't it there's the dataclean room so think I mean data sharingis the heart of what you facilitate sotalk a little bit of data sharing butalso I'd be interested to you to say alittle bit about data warehouses serversyou're really one of the Pioneers withthat use case now it's driven value foryouyeah that's right we uh we do Drive datacollaboration in the ecosystem and weare a privacy-centric company and so inorder to do that safely we have a coupleof tools in our tool belt one of them isdata clean rooms that we bring thecustomers data in be a two orthree-party data and allow them to jointhat data in a safe and effective mannermanner through our identity resolutioninside the clean room we also work witha lot of companies that kind of span theSpectrum on the maturity that thetechnology and Cloud maturity spectrumand so some companies need help needhelp managing their identity need helpmanaging their data and so what we cando for them is we can establish anenvironment in our tenancy and set uptheir data set up their systems applyidentity and basically they have a readyto go first party data strategy usingthis this data warehouse as a serviceand it really made makes things smootheasy and and easy to get up and runningin their their collaboration strategyand does that enable you to provideadditional Professional Services to themto help guide them as well as thesoftware you're helping them to evolvetheir strategy using your expertise Etcyeah that's right we offer ProfessionalServices because we know that things inthe data industry aren't alwaysself-serve and easy to doespecially when it comes to our deepindustry expertise and identity we canoffer Consulting on like how to buildthe identity strategy for your businessgoals and having access to the data andhaving an environment in our tenancyallows really fast iteration because wedon't have to go back and forth and askfor permission and and it has all thetools at our disposal in order to makeprogress really really fast fantasticso lastly of these patternsum is is perhaps one of the mostinteresting and significant at themoment which is of course the use of AIand ML and having worked with all of youI know that this is a Hot Topic in yourorganizations many of you have beenusing this type of technology for manyyears but have gained some recentimpetus as a result of early emergenceof some of these new models hisarchitectures his capabilities so I'llstart with you Andy and go along I'dlike you each to talk about how perhapswhere you are today and where you'relooking to go in the futureyeah as you mentioned we've been usingAI from the very beginning to try tohelp detect threats and behaviors butgender of AI is a really interestingspace now for us for a number ofdifferent reasons one of the key thingsfrom a Google partnership perspective isGoogle's one of the only companies thatoffers a commercial commerciallyavailable llm focused on cyber securityand that's really important for me ishaving that security expertise builtinto an llm that we can start toleverage and productize for ourcustomers with that right level ofcontextfrom what are we looking at there's anumber of things first is we want tohelp our customers be able to securetheir own llms that they're developingin-house through our platform and theother big area is how do we help withthese cyber security Talent shortage byreally offering new Innovative featuresthat can help train new Cyber SecurityProfessionals on the job help themunderstand what they're looking atderive new insights that they may notknow to to really accelerate theirability to understand the problems thatthey're looking at both all the way downin the sock from an analyst perspectivewe also look on the flip side what doesa CSO need in terms of being able totalk to the board of directors when itcomes to specific cyber incidents andthreats it's a different talk track anddifferent level of detail than ananalyst needs even if it's the samethreat so how do you extrapolate how doyou use generated AI to tell both sidesof that story so really excited aboutthe partnership we have with Google tostart to deliver some of thesecapabilities across our platformDonna Bradshaw is excited to announcethis week our our partnership ingenerative AI going forward and firstbeing vertex I vertex AI being afoundational technology in our AI laband this is a place where our customerscome and develop applications and modelsusing our data that help them supportobviously their business whether it beunderstanding who they should go afterafter first sales and marketingperspective or who they can or should dobusiness with for third party risksuppliers and vendorswe provide a lot of data we provide alot of insights we have we have a lot ofdata science behind it but also using AIto make that information more moreunderstandable more readable forcompanies to really know who are theyworking with should they be working withthem and then even creating the thelinkage of who are these businesses andwho are they connected to so that beingreally the first AI use case we'restarting with as well as using our datafor ourselves and for our customers tofuel these automated chat agents thatcan help provide information across youknow obviously a number of data sets soeasily and so conversationally withouthaving to have you know teams of peoplebehind the scenes providing thatinformation so we're excited for thosefirst two and look forward to many morewith Google cloud and I think that'ssuch a sometimes overlooked aspect of ofgenerative and large language models ingeneral you know we're all familiar withthe the well-known models of course inGoogle and others but that data islargely trained on publicly availableinformation across the web Etc butthere's an enormous amount of incrediblyvaluable data that's private tocompanies that spent 180 years creatingthat data making it valuable and so theability to expose that informationthrough a large language model isincredibly powerful and we're reallyexcited to be working with you to helpmake that happenSpencer oh yeah I'll probably talk abouttwo things one is as a company that hascontent there's obvious use cases thatthat we uh are excited about as itrelates to the content generation sidebut also having so much data about userexperience I think we're reallyinterested in how do we think about dataproducts internally and then map themacross the the suite of our products andso that we can we can apply these modelsnot just in a specific point use casebut really with the context of ourclients across all of our productsthrough the types of content they createthe types of users they have thesegments that they have that interactwith their content as well and so we'rewe're spending a lot of time trying tofocus on those use cases as we getthrough the kind of maybe the morestandard ones that we've seen come outand then I'd just say internally youknow the space is changing rapidly tosay the least and so we're we'rethinking a lot about how do we reducethe friction for adoption for ourproduct teams because we have multipleproducts and Ai and data science and mlas in centralized in a single teamnecessarily anymore it's really spreadout across the company and so how do weprovide the tools to our engineers andour product people and the training toenable them to move as quickly as thisindustry is going and so Google's beenactually a great partner in helping usboth enable those through things likethe open source models and vertex andthen also having training available forour for our engineersthank you Smith and then last but byname means Lise Aaronuh yeah so everything that we do is inservice of helping our customersunderstand their customers and theirprospects better and one of the assetsthat we we have and we facilitate is isa really good first party data strategyand we also have an identity graph andone of the things we've been using for along time we've used several differentdeep learning methodologies over theyears but one of the ones that wecontinue to harken back to is theTransformer architecture something Ithink that you're pretty familiar withconsidering that Google invented itum and so we've used this uh this deeplearning methodology for a while and itreally is accredited with uh with thesuccess of generative AI today butcontinuing to use the tools available tous through Google and other uh in ourown algorithms we're able to continue tocontinually Drive accuracy and matchrates in our graph which affectsliterally every product in our companyuh the better we can connect the data inthe ecosystem the better we can helpcompanies understand every touch pointin the customer Journey the moresuccessful they'll be for their businessoutcomes and so AI is helping pave theway fantastic thank you and I know thatalso of course all of your customers arelooking at this space as well and ofcourse they're looking to join togetherthe data sets that they have to createthat 360 degree view so you can takeadvantage of these new capabilities Iknow live ramp are really at the centerof that and helping organizations likedun and Bradstreet and optimizely becomepart of ecosystem a way where youunderstand who a customer is who arebusiness is and you can join thosetogether so yeah absolutely like I wassaying the more we're able to connectthose data points the more we can driveRevenue through data monetizationbecause the more we're able to match thedata with with Partners throughcollaboration the better results foreveryone fantasticso that's a quick walkthrough of themodels of the patterns that we usewe're out of time now if you have anyfurther questions if you want to followup please reach out to me tomcannongoogle.com I'll be outside we need toleave this room relatively promptly butbefore I close I'll just say a couple ofthings firstly there are a few greatsessions I would highly encourage you toattend first of all if you're interestedin the embedded bi session topic thereis a great session by colleague of ourscander tomorrow at 11 30 I highlyrecommend you look at that we'll go muchdeeper into some of the direct andindirect monetization models reallyknowledgeable uh guy thoroughlyrecommend this session there's alsoanother session tomorrow around thepartner Advantage Program if you'relooking to become part of that and youcan use capabilities like a Google cloudready bigquery program to to monetizeIntegrations that type of thing anexcellent session A Partners here todayexabeam have a topic tomorrow at quarterfive uh sorry today a quarter fivethis session has already been yesterdayI attended it it was excellent uh so youcan see that on demand and then thereare a whole bunch of other partnersgeotab faraday.ai and Atlas AI all ofwhom part of built with bigquery we workwith really closely if you do get achance please stop by their sessionsbecause you'll learn a lot and they'rereally Innovative partnersand last but not least we'd love to haveyour feedback please just take a minuteor two to tell us what you think youknow it helps us to improve and it helpsus to decide whether a similar sessionlike this will be valuable again in thefuture and it really does help us toimprove so with that I'll just say thankyou to you thank you to the panel reallyenjoyed this session today and I hopeyou have too so and enjoy the rest ofnextthank you[Music]foreign"
