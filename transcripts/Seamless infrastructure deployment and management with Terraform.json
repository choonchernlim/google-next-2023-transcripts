    "transcript": "foreign[Music]welcome to the session and good morningso I'm Richland I'm a product manager atGoogle and I spend a lot of time on uhdeclarative infrastructure and a bigfocus of mine is to help you you knowhave the best user experience withterraform on gcpso you have to enjoy the journey not thedestinationso I think the answer that I'd give youreally depends on when you ask me thisquestion right and so at a previouscompany I was at a really largeinformation company and I started off asa contractor then it became avirtualization engineer and eventually alead automation engineer and you know Ihelped provision get infrastructureprovisioning down from about 30 plusdays to 30 minutes and I know it soundsawesome but that was without terraformuh so it was infrastructure the hard wayand but the journey didn't begin thereright because like at the end of TheJourney it was like it was amazing likeit was awesome like everything was greatbut the journey when it started was notso awesome right uh and so when itstarted there was a an automation teamthat was called The A-Team and theseguys were like pros these guys wereawesomeum and they all decided to leave in avery very short period of time forwhatever reason and so that was myopportunity right so I was able to comein and take on everything and I said howhard can this be right this is not toobad right but truth be told uh it wasreally really really hard the journeywas not easy in the beginning rightum and So eventually I learned aboutthis thing called terraformand so that moment I realized that Icould have probably saved about 80percent of my time and so I questionedeverything that I've ever done uh thecool part is that it actually led me tojoin hashicorp and then eventually Ibecame a CE at Google and you know nowI'm a PM at Google uh and so you have toenjoy the journey in order to actuallyreach the destination and if you don'tenjoy it it's going to be extremelyextremely painful and so this sessiontoday is actually about three thingsright the first thing is that we wantyou to enjoy your journey and soeverything I'm going to share with youtoday hopefully makes that Journey justa little bit better and number two wewant to make sure that you know we startthis feedback loop because likeeverything we have today is great butlike we also want to make sure we getthe feedback and we you know hear fromyou and we know exactly like you knowhow to make this better right help ushelp you uh lastly we want to make surethat no matter who you are whetheryou're a learner a builder or anoperator you want to make sure that youcan you know onboard onto gcp withterraform in a very easy wayyou know a little bit about me Emersonsaid and I want to introduce uh you knowalways and poke it who can introducethemselves real quickwe'll get Chandra I am the director ofproduct for uh terraform and I focusprimarily on all the Integrations thatsurround terraformuh my name is always Malik and I am asolution architect with Google Cloudum my specialty is infrastructureAutomation and later today I'm going tobe talking about a demo that we've builtto help customers kind of move theirsolutions to terraform cloud and andwork with them in thereall right thank youokay all right so today's fairly simplewe're going to talk about how you'regoing to adopt build and scale terraformone gcp uh plugin will give you someupdates from hashicorp and then we'll doa demo and then we'll hopefully havesome q aall right before we get started just Ineed a quick raise of hand so I justwanted to kind of know who everybody isso who in here is just getting startedwith terraform he's just like raise yourhandand if you keep your hands up and ifyou're enjoying the Journey Keep YourHands Up if you're not put your handsdowna few of you put your hands down allright uh and how many of you are likethe terraform ogs like you got like fiveyears of experience there we gonice keep your hands up now if you'reenjoying the journey keep them up ifyou're not oh if you went down okayinteresting uh how many of you areDevelopersthat are also doing terraformand are you enjoying the journeyoh yes I kind of expected thatdevelopers don't really want to doeverything about terraform right theywant to they want to write their codeand so I get that and lastly like howmany of you are in like a cloud platformor an SRE teamokay bunch of you all right are youenjoying the Journey Keep Your Hands Upa few of you okay put it down all rightso all of you that dropped your handsmeet us outside I'd love to get yourfeedback and hear all about exactly whythat journey man is not going so wellright we're here to help you outso uh before we get any further I wantto level set what's terraform I thinkmost of us know what terraform is rightyou have a user describe the config filethey're going to use terraform with someproviders and then those providers aregoing to give you access to certainresources in this case like we have theGoogle cloud provider that's going togive you access certain resources onGoogle Cloud but you may have otherproviders as well right so the processis pretty much the same uh but the thethe benefit to our customers right isreally about number one is that singleworkflow I mean I think nobody can denylike you have one workflow to do it allright the other thing is that it's ainfrastructure as code so it's code andyou get to do all the things with coderight like Version Control and rollbacksand collaboration and all that goodstuff and lastly right it's much easierto adopt new infrastructure in thefuture once you're already usingterraform so I think that's that'sreally awesome right so what we want todo now is actually focus a little bitmore on the Google cloud provider andspecifically like resource coverageand so most of the resource coveragethat you're going to need is alreadycovered right it's in the provider butthe question is like how do theresources actually get added into theprovider so someone has to spend sometime adding that in and so traditionallywe have the terraform team like for avery long time for years they've beenadding these resources they prioritizethey stack Rank and like you know theymake sure they add all the resourcesthey can but you know it's a handful ofpeople right and it's not very easy andso what is Google doing differently inorder to scale coverage what we're doingis we're working with product andEngineering teams and service teams tobasically help you know scale this out alittle bit so we're onboarding teamswe're making sure that they can like youknow add these resources faster and solike the ultimate goal for us is to haveday Zero support and you may get that insome cases you're not going to get itfor everything right but that's our likethat's our Dream right we want day Zerocoverage for everything you got aservice that comes out on gcp it'savailable on terraformum and lastly hashicorp right I mean thepartnership with Hachi Corp is isdefinitely like it's pivotal for Hashiand Google but I think more importantlyfor our customers like we want to giveyou the best experience so we work on aweekly basis we work all the time wetriage you know uh issues and we makesure we resolve issues in a timelymannernow I've spoken to hundreds of customersover the last few years and I gotta saylike yes the provider is the mostimportant thing without the provider youhave nothing but the fact is thatthere's way more that you care aboutthan just a provider and so today we'regoing to talk a little bit about some ofthese things right and so like we'veheard you we know that you know you wantmore and so hopefully what we discussedtoday is going to help you enjoy yourjourney just a little bit morenow the first thing is right we have uhwe're proud to announce that we actuallyhave terraform support on Google cloudand now you know this is in partnershipwith hashicorp and you know it's forpremium support customers actually rightand so what does this mean it means thatthe support team is going to triagethese issues they're going to you knoweither resolve them if they can if theycan't then they're going to forward itto the right team right whether it's aservice team or the terraform team or ifit's terraform core issues they're goingto send it to Hashi Corp rightum and so hopefully this is going tomake your experience a lot betterum and if you have Hashi Corp supportand Google Cloud support then that makesit even better and you'll have even abetter experience thereum and so what does this cover it coversthe gcp terraform provider issues theAPI issues uh and also like I mentionedthe terraform core issues but what thisdoesn't cover is actually the uhconfiguration so like if you haveBlueprints and stuff like that it won'tactually cover that but what you shoulddo is reach out to your account teamsyour CES Etc right like there's like awhole bunch of them we partnered withhashicorp and have certified onterraform everyone's learning more andmore about terraform and we've got thosefolks who aren't certified and they'relike terraform gurus right so talk toyour account teams and get help there aswell and if all else fails please reachout to me and reach out to my teamohall right so I'm actually also excitedto partner with the Google Cloudcommunity in 2023 we're doing a lot morewith terraform right we want to makesure that you know we provide you livetraining and enablement sessions and soyou know stay tuned for that if you signup you'll get those updates so theGoogle Cloud Community is actually youknow it's going to allow you to getaccess to experts you know thousands andthousands of them your peers andgooglers and some of who are actuallybuilding and and creating your productsright so if you want to take advantageof this right it's free to sign up uhyou know you can ask questions you canparticipate uh maybe you know get somefree prizes with some learningchallenges Etc but I definitelyrecommend this it's going to keep you upto dateall right so this is uh we just recentlylaunched our first version of thematurity model the terraform on gcpmaturity model now this is our attemptto help you better understand where youare if you're a learner a builder or anoperator like how can you adoptterraform on gcp uh you scan thisbarcode to get all the details rightwe're not going to go through everythingtoday uh but this is definitely going tocover a lot of things and we partneredwith hashing Corp on this and throughcustomer feedbackand if you didn't get the QR code don'tworry we'll make sure we get it afterall right first step right uh is thefirst phase is adopt and so you might bea developer you might be new to gcp youknow new to terraform Etc and so likehere's some great resources to getstarted one of the first ones is ourterraform docs page um our goal is towork you know with the content team andto make sure that we get all terraformstuff into one place and so this is ourDream right like we want to make sureeverything's there but like wedefinitely need your feedback rightwe'll iterate on this we'll improveum and so make it better and better overtimenow once you have the provider and youhave the resources I think the next mostimportant thing is the blueprints rightbut blueprints is an overloaded term youmay or may not already know this rightbut I want to just make sure I clarifythis if I say blueprints for modules inthis talk uh the rest of the time rightlike they're pretty much interchangeablebut I do want to describe thedifferences a little bit right and soblueprints are actually the goldenstandard of you know of modules in ouropinion right and so they're going togive you all those things they're goingto give you the resource diagram they'regoing to give you tests they're going togive you all the good stuffum and so the way I summarize it is thatyou know all blueprints include modulesnot all modules are blueprintshopefully that makes senseso at a high level I want to cover threethings right so if you're just learningto use resources I'd recommend the oneon the left and that's samples right sothey're very quick to get started andyou're just learning and like they'repretty pretty fast some of them are alittle lengthy but mostly they're veryquick examples and if you're looking foropinionated Solutions on gcp then I'drecommend the center one which is cloudFoundation toolkit and if you're lookingif like if you're comfortable buildingmodules yourself and you have experiencewith it I'd recommend the cloudFoundation fabric on the right hand sideand that's a whole session by itself sowe're not going to go too deep in thatuh this is jumpstart Solutions the wasteis going to go into this a little moredetailum you know this is basically pre-builtapplications and infrastructure bestpractices right you can deploy with afew clicks onto your Google Cloudaccount and this is going to give youhands-on experience it's going to giveyou interactive environment and so whywould you actually do this right thereason is like you want to accelerateyour path towards building your own appsyou also want to make sure that you canquickly build confidence and getfamiliar with the Google Cloud you knowproducts and plus we're going to giveyou reference architecture guideswalkthroughs Etc and all of that so it'sgoing to help you get started reallyquicklyuh another thing we want to announce isthat we have uh this thing calledinfrastructure manager andinfrastructure manager like a waste isgoing to talk about it more but what Iwant to share with you is that Google isactually leveraging info manager on ourSolutions so in the previous examplejumpstart you can deploy with a fewclicks and that capability is providedthrough infrastructure manager the otherthing is that info manager actually wentGA recently and so you can actually playaround with it you know you can scan theQR code you can take a look and see ifthat's interesting to youum and so again like I mentioned there'sa lot more things on the on the on theguide right I think one of the mainthings I'd mentioned is like the thecloud skill boost like we had somereally good trainings here if you'reinterested in the training with likefour and a half five stars thousands ofreviews uh lots of terraform sessionsthere's also a terraform certificationprep uh it's actually really really goodvery well receivednow as a builder right you already haveexperience with infrastructure you mayalready have experience with gcp rightand so you may be a developer you may bean SRE you may be a platform admin or acloud team rightum and now so when you're learning rightyou may not have all the foundations inplace uh you know and it takes some timeso if you're not familiar we have theGoogle Cloud security Foundation rightit's going to basically give you anopinionated view of Google Cloud's bestpractices and now you know what is cloudsetup so Cloud setup is a multi-stepguide that's going to give you theability to walk through and lay out yourfoundations and at the end you have thechoice you can either click and deploywhich again uses info manager or you candownload the terraform configurationsand you'll be able to deploy it in yourown Pipelinesand this is also another cool featurein the console and you've you knowfilled out a VM form and then you saidgive me the equivalent rest or give methe equivalent you know CLI now you canalso get the equivalent terraformcommands this won't work for everyproduct but our product teams areworking to integrate this and make itbetter and I'd recommend like reachingout to the product teams and lettingthem know that you want to see thisfasterall right again like before there'sdefinitely lots of other you knowmaterial there for you to look at andmainly it's like if you want tocustomize blueprints customize jumpstartSolutions right you want to create yourown blueprints you want to create yourown modules you want some more advancedyou know uh Cloud skill boost and all ofthat right you'll get access to all ofthatand now how do you scale so as anoperator rightum you already have experience withGoogle Cloud you have experience withterraform right a lot more than othersright but you may be on a platform teammaybe on a cloud team an SRE team Etcbut how do you scale terraform on gcp wecan talk about this for hours so I'm notgoing to do that to you today it's goingto cover a few thingsthe the main thing here I think is theour best practices we spend a lot oftime on this it's a comprehensive bestpractice guide you could start whenyou're adopting you could start whenyou're building of course but like ifyou're if your goal is to scale uh youdefinitely want to you know look throughthis and and more importantly rightthere's a lot of variables it's not verystraightforward there's a lot of piecesand a lot of teams that I've talked tothey typically just get started and theyfigure out the best practices along theway and then you realize like it's notso easy to like fix everything againright and so talk to hashicorp talk toGoogle and let us help you like kind offigure out like what the best practicesare and how you know you can get startedbut also when you're scaling right thedecisions you make early on are going todictate how you are going to enjoy thatJourney right and so the more bestpractices you know you you're familiarwith I think the better experienceyou're going to have on gcpso as an operator you have lots and lotsof decisions to make right like we getquestions all the time like you know howdo you take advantage of the producerconsumer model how do you scale on gcpwhat are the best practices you knowpolicy governance Etc so there's a lotof different things but one of the mostpopular questions I think is buildversus buy and I think everyone here atsome point has gone through some sort ofexperience around build versus buyum when I think of build versus buy Ican think of one particular personalstory and I just want to share that withyou todayso in 2015 my wife and I we purchasedour first home long story short uh wewant to do some renovation we hired acontractor we started off as like thislittle Renault turn into an entire gutjob right like I gutted the entire houseand all the bathrooms which is a wholeother story of why I did that it wasdefinitely a mistake uh but you knowlike my contractor decided a few weeksin like he's gonna leave me and so Italked to my wife I was like we got thislike we're going to do this ourselvesand we decided to do it ourselves uh andso the journey begannow that smile is genuinebut that guy don't know what I know 100uh and so you know my wife she was youknow my wife she's an interior designeror for this house she was uh and changeorders weren't a thing for her rightlike she just makes changes and I justhave to implement those changes she waslike my first customer as a generalcontractor my first and last actually uhand I did everything I was the floor guyI was the Mason I was the you know I didall of it the plumbing the electricaleven the HVAC systemum and I learned a ton right and ofcourse I hired help that's my daughterIman she's helping in his Free Laborwhich is great uh but long story short Imoved in in 2017.now the end results are truly awesomelike of course like I'm so happy like wespent all this time we spent all thismoney but like we have a home and we'revery very happy right uh and I learned alot and it's not just about building ahome I learned a lot about myself rightlike in that processum and I also learned what I'm capableof and I think in Tech right that's kindof what it's about like when we buildlike that's what we're trying to dowe're trying to learn and through thatprocess no matter how hard it is nomatter how much you Bang Your Head onthe keyboards like at the end of the daythat growth and that learning is allwhat it's about right so there's adefinitely value there but then if youask me today 100 I enjoyed this journeynow this is where the story getsinterestingso three months before I moved in myneighborhe buys a houseand he gutted the whole thing and notonly that he built an entire secondfloorand he moved in exactly when I moved inso to put it all into perspective likeyes money is a factor you're right but Ispent a lot of money as well just likehe did but in three months he had awhole brand new house and he moved inwith menow what does this have to do withbuilding infrastructure in my opinion Ithink a lot right collectively in hereyou probably have Decades of experienceof infrastructure configurationmanagement uh maybe centuries I'm notsure right and in some way you know Ithink most of you probably know whereI'm going with this alreadyum and so on one endI could build you a house today right Iknow my house inside and out and likemany of you you know your systems insideand outum and so I know what's Behind the Wallsif something breaks I know exactly howto fix itum and but if someone were to buy myhouseprobably going to struggle a little bitmaybe right they don't know everythinglike I knowum and so now if I were able to buildyou a house again I can do it better Ican do it more cost effectively I canmake sure it's I can do it fasterbecause I've learned through thatprocess and that's I think what Billgives you right it's like it's going togive you that experience over time nowhere are the facts it took me two yearsto move intook me two years of mortgages it tookme two years of living with my parentsthat was great it's not a bad thing butlike I put them at inconvenience and twoyears of my life and no time with myfamily that I could never get back andif you asked me todaywould I ever go back and change it Iprobably wouldn't because I did learn alot and I really appreciated it but I100 would do things a little differentlysohere are some considerations right Ourintention is not to tell you whatdecision to make whether you build oryou buy what Our intention is is to helpcustomers to make well-informeddecisions right you may have differentneeds right maybe you have differentautomation needs maybe you havedifferent support needs right andsecurity and and compliance needs maybeyou're in terms of resources you don'thave all the in-house talents maybe youdo right and that all depends in termsof budget but it's real it's a thingright like you gotta actually considerit and so all of that factors inum and so there's a lot of additionalconsiderations as well likeorganizational culture timeline Etc andall that stuff uh but what we want youto do is to Choose Your Own Adventureright like Google is providing you somesolutions and some documents and sometools and all of that to make your lifea little bit better to make a journey alittle bit better how she's going toprovide you with terraform Tara fromEnterprise terraform cloud and all ofthat right and the demo waste is goingto show you is going to show you how youcan actually get started now you don'thave to make the decision right away butthen later on you can migrate to anothersolution like terraform Cloud right andand how we're going to make that easierfor you soas you embark on this journey toautomate your infrastructure pleaseremember to enjoy the ride and if youneed help along the way we're here foryou and with that thank you forlistening I'm going to hand it off tobook itthank youall right continuing the journeysum I'm gonna share some of the updatesthat hashicorp is trying to investcontinuously in terraform and what arethe some of the latest things that weare looking atall rightum first off terraform and Google asarslan was talking about like thepartnership is really strong we arebuilding a lot of things togetherum and our Focus right now is uh we makeit extremely easy for customers to do uhdeployment of terraform Enterprise onGoogle cloud and Google kubernetesengine in fact so with this flexibledeployment option that we recentlyreleased in beta and will be going GApretty soon you can actually runterraform Enterprise on any kind ofcloud infrastructure and kubernetes isone of the favorite ones for a lot ofcustomers and GK is one of the bestplaces to run kubernetes so that's whatwe supportuhoops I made a mistake sorryall right uhthe previous one I I forgot to mentionone thing which is like agents soanother thing that we're working on isuh agents architecture that you canactually run something in your inprivate infrastructure or some differentCloud when you're using terraform cloudand the Agents would help youmanage some of the operations locallythat's cool based system uh and uh it'spretty effective especially forcompanies that are more compliance andsecurity focusedhere's the one that I wanted to talkabout which is flexible deploymentoption now available uh something thatyou can run on gke and uh one of thebiggest challenges that we have seenwith terraform Enterprise is that it'savailable on replicated and there hasbeen some uh opinions that our customerwanted some some of the different typeof deployment options and now withflexible deployment option you canactually deploy it in differentdifferent uh infrastructure and gkebeing one of themthe next up is there from cloud operatorfor kubernetes nowas as you all are aware that they'refrom cloud is a SAS solution and it it'sit runs fine it's available but a lot oftimes customers want a more nativekubernetes experience what this operatorbrings in is that terraform Cloudfunctionality to the kubernetes systemand you can use functionalities likedrift detection checksand access the large very stableterraform provider ecosystem inside ofkubernetes using kubernetes native APIso that's a pretty convenient way ofgiving this functionality to our usersand we'll continue to invest in thiswe'll continue to expand its uhoperations as as we go along that'scurrently available in beta it's goingto go ga very soon uh we'll probablyannounce more at couponum speaking of uh Cloud agents that wehave introduced before we have a lot ofInvestments going in that direction anduhand those Cloud agents as I said likethis is more aa system where you canagents can actually pull informationfrom the terraform Cloud so I'm muchmore of a pull based mechanism much moresecureand doesn't really require somethingthat is sitting outside of your networkto reach inside uh and so it's much moresecure and we plan to havesorry I have some mistakes in the notesyeah perfect so we have these moduleswhich are available uh with theterraform sorry Google Cloud which Oasisis also going to probably touch on thatwe've developed in conjunction withGoogle and it basically allows you todeploy agents on manage infrastructureand do a container enginesEtcand with that I'm going to hand it overto Louisesure thanksso for this part of the presentationwe're going to look at a demo of thisthing called jumpstart Solutions and aproof of concept application that we'vebuilt called superum that can help customers evolvesolution management as they step throughthe maturity model that our salons hastalked about a few minutes agoum so let's take that maturity model andoverlay that on top of a typical journeyof a customer that's adopting gcp astheir cloud providerthe first thing they'll typically do isexplore what gcp has to offer in termsof product and services right nextthey'll try to learn how to set up thosetypical use cases for example a webapplication or a data warehouseon using those services and productsonce they get comfortable with the thesetup and initial you know use casesthey'll want to evolve those Solutionsand make them their own something alittle more production grade somethingwith customer requirements more securebefore they open that up to the massesrightand while they're doing thatum change management and governance isgoing to become a priorityum more specifically how do you makesure that you're you're promotingchanges to your code base of yourapplication as well as the underlyinginfrastructure in a controlled manner soto help with this journey we've done acouple of things number one we've gotthisfeature called jss jumpstart solutionsthat helps with the earlier part of thejourney which is exploring learning andthen we have this concept called Hooperright now it's not part of the consoleyet but we'd like your feedback ifthat's something like you'd like to seethere we're just going to help with thelatter part of the journey which isbuilding and operatingsowith that we're going to go ahead andand look at this demo here let metry to get this set upso to start off you know let's justassume that this is a customer that isbeginning their Journey with GoogleCloudand um you know the the good place to bethere isum jumpstart Solutions it's going togive you a list of opinionated Solutionsauthored by Google Cloudum that you can leverage quickly forthis demo we're going to take a look atthis three-tier web application andclicking on that card is going to bringup the solutions detail page which tellsme everything I need to know about thesolution right I have the descriptionhereI can tell the products being usedwithin the solution and also how theykind of connect with each other in alogical manner there's Cloud run there'sCloud SQL memory store and VPCserverless access for cloud run thediagram kind of depicts what's going onthere right additionally I've got somemore information likeum the the the price and the deploymenttime and so on and so forth there's acouple ways you can deploy this you candeploy directly through the console oryou can actually go through GitHub ifthat's what you prefer to do downloadthe code base directly available thereand use the terraform CLI to do thatdirectly but since you know we'relearning and exploring we'll we'll goahead and do that directly hereum select a project configure viewdetails like region and Zonereview the settings and then hit deployso with that you have the solutiondeployed within gcp this basically usesthis new service that we just went GAwith recently called infrastructuremanager which is essentially a managedterraform deployment experience you giveit a configurationit gives you the resources based onthose configurations and it manages thestate for you so it has a terraformRunner and everything and it basicallygives you what you ask for whilemanaging the state for you so in aminute here we'll see that this solutionis deployedand there you have it so this solutionessentially at this point hasjoined some of the other solutions thatwe've deployed in this project solet's just take a pause and see what wedid we we were exploringwe learned about certain Solutionswe picked three-tier web app and we wentahead and deployed it right so let'sassume as a customer I want to take thatthe retier web app and I want to extendit right what do I need for thatum number one I'm at the very leastgoing to need a forked instance of thecode base right uh that I can extendbecause right now this code base isprobably given it's it's read only Ineed to take that and I need to startextending it and then secondly I need aworkspace space where I can collaboratewith my team members that have theterraform runner in it so if I makechanges to my code basethose changes can actually travel up tothe gcp resources as they reconcile soto address that challengewe're going to see how super our proofof concept is going to address thatso we're going to bring up super here solike I said it's not in the console yetbut it works off the public apis andright now it's connected to the sameproject where we had the solutionsdeployedso we select that project and we haveall the listing herenow our goal is to move the tiered webapp solution right at the topinto terraform cloudright because that's where we're goingto start making changes to itumbut I'm going to here pause for a secondhere just to kind of explain a few morethingsumso we we need a space for the gitrepository that we can extendso for that we need to configure hostsuch as GitHub where we can put thatcode right and the second place is theworkspace where we can actuallycollaborate with our team members andreview changes as they come in so forthat we're going to select here fromcloud right so these are the two hoststhat we're going to go ahead andconfigure within this application hereso there's terraform Cloud beingconfigured in a bitso we can bring it up we'll give it anID and a name and since this isterraform Cloud the host will beapp.terraform.ioif you choose to do this in a privatelyhosted terraform Enterprise versionthat's also possiblethe US token would have access to createworkspaces and there you have thatregistered we're doing we're going to dothe same thing for the git host as wellfor the Repositoryand we'll do that thereID name and sinceum this is a demo I'm just going to usemy personalGitHub host account here to create therepository and the as token would haveaccess to create repositories in myorganization so we have the pre-rexsetup nowand let's go back to deployments andwe'll try to migrate thisumso we're going to bring up the migrationpaneland we selected the host terraform Cloudwhich has access to this gcp migrationorganization in terraform cloudright and that's the workspace thatwe're going to create in theresimilarly the GitHub host that weselected here has access to createrepositories and that's what therepository name is going to be and withthat we're just going to go ahead andhit migrateand now the migration has started rightso there's a few things happening herenumber one we're setting up a terraformworkspacenumber two we're cloning the code fromthe existing jss code base to the gitrepository where we just created the theRepositorynumber three we're taking the state outof infra manager where it was beingmanaged within gcp we're taking thatstate and putting it in terraformworkspace nowso there's no changes when it reconcilesand then lastly the new repository thatwe just created we're connecting it tothe workspace so we can start to trackchanges there right and nowum we can tell that it's it's beenmigratedand at this pointthe solution that we wanted to make ourown we have it available in in terraformworkspace where we can start makingchanges to it and start reconciling itso we'll take a look at thatin a little bitmigration so yeah that's the lastmigration that we just didand we'll go ahead and see how thingsare looking in terraform Cloud worldright so that's the workspace that wejust did and we can see that it iscurrently planning so it's just tryingto figure out is there any changes herethat I need to reconcile but because webrought the state overthere's not going to be any changes hereto doum it turned green so the details wouldconfirm that as well zero changes to theresourcesand now let's start extending this rightsoum the GitHub link right on the topthereis going to take us to the gitrepository where we actually cloned andandforked that repository that we took fromDSS right so that's our repository thereand we'll change it to the branch thatthe workspace is tracking for changesand uh we'll just go ahead and make avery insignificant change likemaybe add a label to one of theresourcesjust to demonstrate that it's workingand we'll go ahead and do this directlyin GitHub it's a pretty pretty niceinterface herescroll downand there we have it right so we'll justgo ahead and add a label call manage byterraform cloudand we'll go ahead and commit thischange directly to the branchnow in in a real world scenarioobviously you're not going to do thisyou're probably going to have a betterget Ops process than that butfor the purpose demonstration we're justgoing to do it thereforeignand just to make sure that that's theonly change that we did we'll look atthe history for that committhat's the only change right nowtheoretically this shouldbe propagated up to the workspace or wecan review it and we can see that now ithas started planningso shortly it should show that there's achange that needs to be reconciledand there it is right so there is onechange and if we look at the detailswe should see thatthat was the resource that we changedand that was the change that we made tothe resource and if this looks good tome as a code reviewer and an approverI can go ahead and put my comments applyit and this change would actuallypropagate all the way to the resourcelabyrinth in this casesojust recapping what we did here westarted off our journey with justexploring and learning about products wepicked up a use case we deployed it veryquickly using the info manager allwithin gcpnow we wanted to extend it we took outthe solution from infer manager put itinto terraform cloudand now we can start making more changesand kind of scale that that process alot more okay thank you thank youeverybody[Applause]"
