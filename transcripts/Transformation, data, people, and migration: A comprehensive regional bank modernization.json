would uh decideto spend that time with us thisafternoonI'm going to start off with a very quickshow of hands and I want everybody to behonestwho thought 10 years ago you might besitting in a roomlearning about a bank who's movingeverything to the cloudyeah not many rightI didn't see any handsalright so as a recovering CIO myself 10years ago I was the CIO at Dow Jonesleading a big digital transformationwhere we're removing a lot of our ourRIT estate to the cloud we went from 56data centers down to six moved about ahundred million dollars in cost toproduct development the thing I'm mostproud of is we went from a few softwarereleases a year if we were lucky tohundreds a week and everybody thought wewere crazy at the time and certainly allmy peers didn't think banks were movingbut that time has comeand today we're going to learn from someof our esteemed colleagues and one ofour most strategic customers and theirpartner about how they are in fact usingthe cloud to to drive their theirdigital transformation so I'm delightedto beum joined by our guests if we want tojust go down and introduce yourselvesbefore we get startedMark Chastain Arvest Bankexecutive director of I.Thello I'm Kevin Curtis and I runsolemn's Global Google center ofexcellenceLaura Merling Arvest Bank and I run atransformation and Bank operationsgood afternoonthank you well thanks for being here myname is Steven orb and I look after ourmigration program and our isv ecosystemand our in our Marketplace business andif it's one thing I've learned inworking in hundreds of large-scalemigrations over the course of the pastdecade when I was at Dow Jones leadingtheir transformation and then eightyears at AWS before I joined Googleis that the technology is often the easypart a lot of what goes on in atransformation is around evolving yourpeople your process and your culture allhaving to evolve in unison to drive thekind of change that that most of ourcustomers are looking for when they moveto the cloud and in any kind ofmigration we that I've seen that workedwell there tends to be five attributesthere's a business case an executivealignment on that business case whyyou're doing what you're doing andmaking sure the executive team isaligned to it there's a learning andenablement plan where all of theTechnology Associates in particularhave an understanding of what's going tochange about their role and the skillsthat they need to learn in order to tohelp Drive the the organization forwardthere's a cloud team at the center who'sthinking about how to harvest all thebest practices and learnings from themigration the transformation so thatthey can enable workloads to move fasteras they go and they would tend to drivethe fourth and the fifth which is aclearly defined set of goals and someclear governance around it So todaywe're going to have a discussion aboutwhat Arvest and solemn is seeing aroundbreast practices like that so Laura I'llI'll start with you if that's all righthow would you frame you know the thestate of the bank when when you gotthere and sort of the goals andobjectives that you had to drive thetransformation you're working on nowyeah absolutely and thank you for theinvitation thank you all for joining usum so Arvest Bank just to give a littlebackground uh we're a privately heldBank about 26 billion dollars in assetsso mid-sized Bankum we still like to think of ourselvesas a Community Bank uh we are veryCommunity Centricum so you know the bank's been aroundfor about 60 years and so one of the keythings that we needed to make sure ishow do we keep relevant how do we makesure we're around for the next 60 yearsor 100 years and so that was one of thekey things of our like transformationgoals well you'll also see up here onthe on the slide is just kind of whatare the business things we were tryingto do how do we how do we grow but yetbe Community focusedum how do we try to continue to servesmall business and Commercial customersa lot of folks are going after retaildoesn't mean retail is not interestingbut where our strengths were we'rereally in serving small business andCommercial customers you know anotheraspect of this is how do we think aboutbanking as a service as part of ourfuture and where we're going and whatwe're doing so all of that was kind oftied up in really what we wanted out ofthat transformation program and we knowit's about a five-year program so whenwe think about just gcp so you go okayhere's the transformation program andthen you think about Google Cloudum probably two main thingsbroadly speaking how do you get tosimplification standardization and scaleright that's kind of one set of how dowe go achieve that the last piece of itis really around data we know that datais a key component of what willdifferentiate differentiate Us in theend now everybody says that right butit's about how you use that data whereyou use it how you use it to meetcustomers when where and how they wantto be met so that's really kind of itawesome well thanks for sharing thatletter staying relevant certaincertainly sounds like a worthy goal tellus a little bit more about how you endedup choosing to work with Google and andthen of course slalom who we know ishelping you along the way yeahabsolutely soum I was I I did do a short stint atGoogleum we were just talking about thatearlier so I was a little bit biased butthe reality is when I think about Googleand and prior to joining Google and alsowell here just learning about everythingthat from at the hardware layer all theway up so Hardware from a securityinfrastructure layer and that thatbuilt-in security all the way through towhat we can do with AI and vertex uhvertex Ai and what that might help uswith in terms of ml Ops so knowing thatwe needed like Best in Class technologyespecially if we wanted data as adifferentiatorum I'd say the the next thing is reallythe approach so my role uh when I was atGoogle was to be a transformationofficer which meant we partnered withthe customer to help them meettransformation goals it wasn't uh it wasan interesting role right and it's itstill exists we were just talking abouta couple of my friends that are meetingright now that do that role but it wasthis how do we go help you be successfulwhat are the metrics you want to achieveand how do we help you do that and howare we there for the Long Haul we'regonna have some hits and we're gonnahave some misses and we wanted somebodythat would partner with usthat also takes me into why slalomum so slalom just like Google has been apartner it everything that we do is sideby side it is not I'm going to do it foryou and then hand it over to you at somepoint or they're not there to beembedded in our team for the next 20years and just do the roles of our teamuh that relationship is really about arelationship and making our folkssuccessful in teaching them along theway side by side and that's really whatwe are looking for and I had previousexperience with slalom on on projects soI knew their approach yeah partnershipwas key I love the the side by sidephrase I'd argue that side by side ishow tech tech vendors and Tech partnersare going to stay relevant as well asopposed to the throwing it over the wallthat maybe we would have seen over thecourse of the last several decades camtalk to us a little bit about yourapproach working with Arvest oh yeahyeah fantastic so uhlook when you're working with a companythat is that is making a massivetechnology shift in this case moving tothe cloud enabling a new data platformit's the risk is not in the technologytechnology is always solvable it's inthe people it's the friction thathappens under this pace of change thatget that places all the risk and so youhave to really get at a human leveland engage with the stakeholders suchthat they can identify exactly whatyou're saying about where do you want togo and how you're going to get there wehave a whole model that is something onthe thing called business technologyenabled by Google it ties directly tothe key points that Stephen was talkingaboutum in terms of like the ramp program andwhat that does is the whole model setsyour client up for success and then youwork yourself out of the job that'sthat's the end goal because theirsuccess is where you are successfulunlocking yourself in that way allowsyou to do withit's incredibly satisfyingyeah thanks camumso switching gear is just a little bitLaura I suspect coming in 60 year oldBank might be might have some certainhabits that they've acquired over thatperiod of time I suspect that maybethere were some people you had toconvincemaybe up down and across theorganization how did you approach thatabsolutely so um I think first uh wewant to know where we were we have tokind of understand right I'm coming intoone I'd never been in financial servicesbefore I'd done transformation but indifferent Industries so I'm like what dowe got here what do they really hirehire me to do and so part of it was umfocusing on what we call thevulnerability study uh and so thevulnerability study really gave usinsights to the fact that we weren'treally meeting the customers needs orexpectations on time to Market newtechnology Etc and so the question washow are we going to do thatum and so we didn't want to make thisabout cost savings so our transformationyes we'll measure some cost savings butthat is not the key metric it is thisvulnerability study and we want toactually minimize their thevulnerability of them leaving like youknow on a scale of one to ten if they'reat 10 they they kind of like you andthey're going to stick around the rocksand the shoes are okay if you're at aone and they feel one more Pebblethey're leaving I would like to becloser to the 10 than the one one sothat's kind of the framing of it andthen um what we actually did in terms ofconvincing the folksum in terms of the direction that wewanted to take so it was thevulnerability study and then what it wasactually doing wasum figuring out how do we Implementsomething that achieves thatvulnerability study objectives likeremoving customer pain points cool soTCO is almost a table stakes and thencustomer retention and not beingvulnerable to them leaving is the realthe real business case that customerattention now your executives arealigned on which is which is nice sowhere did you start so now you've pickedGoogle you you've picked slalom you haveyour sort of top level of objectiveswhat'd you do next yeah well so umnew I wanted to partner with both buthadn't yet picked them because you haveto go okay so so tell us the land howbad is it right tell us how bad thepatient is so the vulnerability studywas just the customer viewum so there's a much like you have yourfive pillars I have a five pillar modelfor transformation and one of thosepillars is a technology assessment andthe technology assessment includes anevaluation of all of our systems all ofour infrastructure and so we had hiredslalom uh to help us go do thattechnology assessment what do we haveum what should we be retiring what iseligible for migration uh what what dowe have and what's the state of itanother piece of it that we also askedthem to do was a data assessment so adata maturity assessment this wasanother key piece whereas our data whatdo we know about our data how do we getaccess to our data can we is it lockedup is it possible do we have contractsthat get us that data like what's ourdata maturity and I would probably sayon a scale of 1 to 10 and we weresomewhere around it too if you reallythink about data maturity and a lot ofthat had to do with the way that thebank was structured historically whichwas into 14 individual business unitsand so you you actually your data wasvery siled in those business units andthen by products so it's been a lot ofwork but those foundations that we gotfrom slalom on the data and the systemswe still use those today those were theframing for our multi-year strategy andmigration plan yeah I'm interesting for14 14 data silos sounds like a lot ofsilos to to break downum so I guess that's probably a goodtransition point to to nanishsounds like a pretty ambitious body ofwork that that your team had a lot to dowith how did you get startedI mean as Laura said uh you know we'rein the process of this transformationum which means that you know our datagrowth was putting a lot of stream onour Legacy data stores right we'retalking about a 60 year old Bankum and you know as she also mentionedyou know data is locked upin in these many different silos and wehave to unlock that dataum so we needed a reliable scalableplatform you know to fulfill thosebusiness needsum as Laura mentioned we started with anassessment uh what's our currentlandscape looks like uh and that's whenwe engage slalom to help us with ourfuture strategy and our high levelstrategy is we need to get that raw datainto a central store we need to curateit we need to hydrate it and then wederive the analytics around thatum and uh you know along the way we alsowanted to make sure that there's privacygovernance and security I see Neilstaring at meum the CSO is always watchingum you know I think I think uh you knowSundar said it best yesterday uh when hewas talking about Google and AI to bebold and responsible uh you know ourtransformation that you knowum you know Laura and us we're drivingis bullum and you know with privacy governanceand security we want to be responsibleso I feel like you know it mirrors whatwe're trying to do at arist and then weidentified use cases there were somehigh value use cases that we thoughtwould be the best to start withum you know it's you feel like you wantto do a big bang but that could takeforever and you want to show value sohow do we take these high value usecasesum and start delivering on that so uh westarted withum you know automated underwriting ourum sentiment analysis on our call centercalls uh various fraud use casesum our ml app strategy uh for how do webuild our AIML models and gen AI sothat's was kind of our journey on how westart yeah it makes sense so socentralizing your sort of data store andyour analytics in one place so you canstart to break down those silosprioritizing the first handful of usecases the way I always like to talk tothe cios about this is pick a couple ofuse cases that are important enough thatyour business gets excited but not soimportant that you're going to get firedif you screw it up so get those kind ofquick wins on the boardum uh maybe tell us a little bit moreabout the sort of attributes aboutbigquery that we were really compelledbyum you know we were looking for a dataplatform that was fully managedum we wanted to make sure that it wasreliable scalableum that was it was Cloud native uh youknow you know as you mentioned 10 yearsago we were in thinking of cloud but youknow it's all Cloud now and you knowit's all Cloud native so how do we picka solution that's Cloud native uh andalso that uh also a a platform that hasstorage and compute that's decoupled andcould scale independentlyum so we looked at several leaders inthe space and there are several goodleaders in the spaceum but as Laura mentioned earlier ourpartnership with Google uh you know kindof led us to bigquery we knew that wecouldn't go wrong with bigquery andthat's how we startedum and it's it's uh you know it's notjust a data warehouse but it's theentire uh you know Supply system how dowe get the raw data in how do we curateit how do we hydrate it how do we getanalytics around that so you knowbigquery enabled us to do thatum also the machine learningcapabilities that bigquery provided ourdata science team uh to build those AIMLmodels so those are some of the reasonsuhcool thanks for thatumLaura tell us a little bit about as someof this work started to progress so nowyou're breaking down some of the silossome of the data is being hydrated andyou're you're doing so in a secure andwell-governed way how did you kind ofcommunicate the progress to keep peopleinformed and patient andwith your movepatiencepatience is a key word I think everybodyelse has more patience than I do you canask my team laternot right nowum but I think I think part of it wasjust starting with what's the value propright why are we trying to do this whatdo we want to achieve and so there werekind of two key thingsum that really came clear through thisvulnerability study from a customer lensso the law the more that we could faceit when we talked to the executive teamand the shareholders about the customerpoint of view the better off we were soone of the very first things was how dowe have a single view of a customer ifyou know I mean it's it's the Holy Grailright of data and so we would like toachieve it but what happened is ourcustomers would feel the fact that youhave we have a credit card business andwe have a wealth management business andwe have a mortgage business every one ofthose have their own applications Idon't have a single view of my financiallifeum you know that's okay but they mightwant thatum so how do we actually create aconsistent experience in a consistentview across what we offer to ourcustomer base because most customers uhif they're sticking around with you for10 plus years they probably have threeto five products in some cases moreso that was one the next one was reallyhow do we think about it fromreal-time data perspective right isanybody here work at a bankmaybe you in batch maybeum so how do we go from batch to realtime and it's a it's a progression it'san education for our Associates but it'salso an education for customers and sothose two things like as a startingpoint was perfect then what we do is wetie our roadmap and our prioritizationto how we're solving those two areas forthe company and so it's conversationswith the board and board meetingsquarterly it's our CEO does a monthlyCEO update and so we have the CEO upthere but we don't it's not just me withthe CEO it'll be the CFO talking aboutour metrics it'll be one of the otherbusiness line uh owners talking aboutwhat we're doing with them we dosomething called the monthlytransformation talk we have about 6 500people at the bank our monthlytransformation talk averages 500attendees and that is not just ourtechnology team but the broader bank andit's what are we doing where are wegoing what's the status and then also westarted something recently we we havesomething called daily popcorn which isan up which is a quick little snack ofupdates but every Tuesday is thetransformation uh update so it'stransformation Tuesday like your tacoTuesday we get Transformation Tuesday soum so that's really you know how it isand then we have a set of metrics thatwe've been workingum very closely with the CFO on todemonstrate the value and those metricsare a combination ofum not just dollar dollar value out butcustomer Improvement as well asassociateum Improvement we'll say time reductionwell who doesn't love popcorn and whodoesn't love Transformation Tuesday uhit sounds amazing it sounds so simple tojust have these regular mechanisms tokeep everybody abreast of where you'regoing but but I think in today's day andage to be a technology leader to be asuccessful technology leaderevangelizing your team's work and andhaving a steady drum beat of theevangelism and that is is superimportant to manage expectations and anddrive changemaybe a little bit more what else didyou uh what else have you learned interms of what's made you successfulI would say that uh you know thepartnership with slalom helping us uhearly on and pretty much uh you knowbeing with us all along this journey uhyou know it's given us the trainingwheels uh for us to be independent andbe able to run on our own soum you know what we have done along thisjourney is we've been upskilling uh youknow our Associatesum and getting them up to speed and it'sbeen going really well so we got slalomworking with us side by side with thosetraining wheels we are learning and weare upskilling our Associates and ourdependencyum you know has been I would sayreducing uh as time goes on so that uhhas been a good you know side by side towhat you had mentioned earlier so thattwo in a box working side by side hasworked uh you know wonders for us andwe're trying to do that across the boardyeah suresorry so one of the things that thatthey have worked out and you can eventalk to Megan who's out here is ahead ofdata engineering one of the things thatthat we've done and super excited aboutwith slalom was started with this um wehave this map because we showed it toour our board members because they'relike well how long are you going to needthese Consultants right we like solemnbut how long are you going to need themright there so so what we did is wecreated this map that showedum where we started we saw them where itwas all slalom people it was just ahandful to get us started and then itramped up and it was I don't knowsomewhere around 20 yeah 20 or so peopleand now as you start to see so it's been18 months later and now we're down towhat five five or so I saw on folkshelping us on that data platform sowe've actually mapped it and modeled itand said look every time we do somethingwith a partner it should look like thisif it's something new that we'relearning sorry I just want to add thatit's all good that's that that graph isthe epitome of working yourself out of ajob it sounds like cam a little bit moremaybe from you on the the pairedprogramming approach that you took to dothat I just absolutely it's just likeum uh Danish said the other thing thoughand I maybe I think we have a questionabout it later but the there's whatLaura LED for Arvest in which we helpedwith is also a lot of role definition sothe paired programming or co-developmenttogether kind of on the job but alsopeople's jobs change and you're explicitand have forethought about it then youminimize the friction later when they'remad at you because you've moved theircheese right to just quote a you knowanother MBA kind of kind of quote butbut it's that and so each team thefundamental education they go in they goin and start working on it there's ahuge variety of their ability to tohandle the change and and move to it umsome are fast and they're off andrunning and Mark's got some teams thatare like maybe a little bit too advancedthey're likebut then others and particularlyapplication teams who are like you knowthey're they're doing a thing andthey're really good at the thing thecloud is not helping them it's just it'sjust it's they need more help and moresupport as they go throughand then but they're getting there andas we migrate each Cloud uh to each teamto the cloud you can see the differencefrom beginning to endyeah I'm a big believer and you alreadyhave the people you need to succeed withthe cloud you just have to train andenable them and yes sometimes there'smaybe a little logitor around that ifthey don't have the skill set but oncethey doum so let's talk a little bit aboutbuilding the foundation and setting astrong Landing Zoneum Mark talk to us a little bit abouthow you you went about that so as westarted on data platform we knew we hadto build a strong Foundation to supportour investors new initiatives because wewere going down a new roads but it wasnew territory for us we didn't have anybackground in this so we partnered withslalom to help us build that foundationand slalom was really patient to help uslearn and educate us on Google servicesand solutionswe wanted to be very thorough ineverything that we did to understand Iam securitynetworking logging and monitoringdisaster recovery and everything elseso once we got the foundation built tostart our new initiation we had twoLanding spaces we needed to build weneeded to build one for data platform weneeded to build a one for our new corebanking system once we had those builtthen we built seven new Landing zonesfor migration and modernizationalong during that time we extended ouractive directory up into Google Cloud webuilt golden images to deploy and weincluded other services such as managedad and Cloud SQL we did all this in thefirst year we built all this usingterraform to make sure we had repeatableprocesses and we focused on automationbecause we needed this we need to do allthis to be critical for us to scalequicklythanks Mark yeah the the golden imageapproach and having the centralizedCloud team kind of really maintain thebest practices and the patterns not onlyleads to Greater scale but it soundslike a more secure uh operating model aswell super important to get that rightup front what what changes you migratedmore applications what did what didn'tchange was the probably the question butuhbut no it was you know before we evereven started our gcp foundation uhslalom partnered with our Enterprisearchitecture group to go through and doan assessment on our first on our topappsso we really wanted to take these appsas soon as the foundation was built andstart lifting and shifting but we neededto understand their Cloud compatibilityand how to move them so we were going toteach we were going to move these andteach our teamshow to migrate to the cloud but the morewe dug into our app stack the more wesaw how intertwined it was over time tosave costwe had deployed multiple applications onthe same server same thing withdatabases same thing with our middlewarelayer so it was heavily intertwined towhere we couldn't just pick something upand move it because because how we haddone it in just the complexity of it sowe really had to come back in and searchfor an app that was not coupled sotightlyso after we got the foundation builtabout two months after we migrated ourfirst appand during that time we migrated alsoour largest database over therefour months after we got the foundationstood up we moved our first financiallysignificant app which was a huge win foruspart of why it took longer you know whatwe learned over there is howinterconnected and intertwined andcomplicated our systems it had builtafter as we grew up as a bankoh but we as we did that we pivotedquickly to teach our teamshow to modernize their applicationsso what we did was we came back in anddid a did a full assessments we from ourinitial modernization or assessment thatwe didwe took those apps started modernizingthem then we came back in and did a fullassessment of our entire stack so wemodernized we went back and assessedover 600 applications in three to fourmonths to come in and build thatlong-term map on how we're going tomigrate over the years or over the nextthree years uh so by the time so aboutwhere we started that we've pivotedthree to four times on our strategy soour remaining Nimble is super importantand learning as you go and making surethat you know the stuff you you learnfrom oh this is a monolith and I'm goingto need to break this up and then maybeI'm going to do some modernization alongthe wayumuh how did you manage the theexpectations as they as they changedmaybe a little bit yeah you showed apicture of a giant bowl of spaghetti noI'm teething which is what it feels likeright I mean you just we when we dug inand we were like okay yep we've but itgoes back to you've got 14 differentbanks you've got different productsyou've acquired stuff you all know thatright when you acquire companies you endup with stuffso um what we tried to do at the verybeginning before we started this wealigned with them that said look we'regoing to do this and we're going tolearn this is all learning it's going tobe a journey we're going to turn leftand right we at least all know where ourdestination is so knowing where thedestination is but knowing that we'regoing to have to make adjustments alongthe ways was very helpful we also hadlaunched something to let them to Signallike look uhagain we like our partner but we wantour teams to be able to own this and doit themselves so we launched somethingcalled me at our vest which was anupskilling reskilling program I think aniniti had mentioned itum so that was a key piece of it andthen what we do is we track milestonesand and numbers and so this stuff thatMark can tell you about the numbers ofservers and the number of databases andthe assessments that we do and we keptthem we were very honest about like heylook we did this we're pivoting here'swhy this is what we learnedum and as long as you share what you'relearning and they go okay we understandum versus trying to hide it like it justwasn't going to work so we've beenpretty transparent yeah so creating thatlearning culture and then continuing toto really communicateum to communicate that acrossanything you'd add well I would say thatuh you know as part of the uh you knowmodernization you know once we set thefoundation for the for the data platformuh then we were able to embark on youknow some of the other things that wewanted to do which is our analyticsplatform our bi strategy how do we dodata governance data quality uh you knowthat is something that you know you knowis going extremely wellum and you know everybody's talkingabout AIML and gen AI uh you know we gotexcited we have many use cases that arein Flight uh you know working you knowwith our Google Partners uh and you knowwe're uh we say you know some um alreadyout there some uh you know in Flightclose to getting thereum you know God is always anxious aboutthat uhhahahaUniversityum you know our futuristic uh stuff thatwe're working onum and what we could also check off isretire some of the Legacy data warehouseyou know that is something that uh youknow it's you know we don't uh you knowwe don't take credit for but in how dowe you know the fact that we havedecommissioned some of that Legacy stuffum and look more into the future so youknow that's what I'm excited about uhyou know there's so much that needs tobe done uh and we are excited with theprogress that we've made so far yeahit's almost like once you actually startto make some progress on themodernization the aperture opens to domore modern things with analytics andartificial intelligence it's frankly thereason I joined Google for from Amazonis I felt Google was much betterpositioned on the analytics and AI frontand sounds like maybe you're starting tosee that that Promised Landum Mark anything you would add on onwhat changed in your team as you startedto do more modernizationoh gosh it was a big pivot for us youknow we went from Theory to actuallydoing the work and showing it you knowand as we moved in initially we thoughthey we're going to go up and we're justgoing to move everything up there intogcp native Solutions but as we got intoit we realized hey we the complexitywe've got to split what we're doing partof it we need to do modernization theother part we needed to do lift andshift so on the modernization end wecame in and we took our most complexapps and then we started to redesignthem and make sure they took use as manyCloud native Solutions as they couldthen we use gcve for two purposes one isto lift and shift and sunset one of ourdata centers the other is to use it as aspringboard to modernize those apps downthe road into more gcp native Solutionsyeah I love that sort of splitting apartthe the the migration or the lift andshift tracks and the modernizationtracks and sometimes I see customersfall into the Trap if we're going tomodernize everything before we move itto the cloud and then they realize thatthey're still going to be there for youknow five five plus years because itbecause it just takes off my my favoritetrick I've seen is a company I workedwith Edmonds years ago to do a prettylarge scale migration they implementedsomething they called the two-week ruleand they gave all of their teams twoweeks to migrate every app from start tofinish and they had to finish the app intwo weeks they could do as muchmodernization as you want as long as itwas done in two weeks and we see I seethat pattern now a lot to try to strikethe right balance between migration andmodernizationcam in terms of like the partnership interms of Laura talked a little bit aboutthat graph how did it change and evolveis the the team started to get skilledthey're learning more and more themigrations are moving faster now in twodifferent swim Lanes how did your yourengagement sort of shift yeah you startoff with uha lot of the kind of prep work is aboutgetting leaders aligned so it's like awhole org design and you knowways of working assessments and all thatconsulting stuff that helps people bringalong for the journey but the thingschange right they're not those peopleand those skills once they deliver thekind of here's the plan and here's howyou can do it you don't they don't theydon't have a role to play anymore sothose you go out of that kind of designin the future to executing the future atthe same time you see more Engineerscome on to go and and execute for thatthat's where the velocity comes fromwe're already starting to see that someof the engineers are starting to shrinkdown we talked about the data from themigration standpoint we're going to beramping down over the next six monthsprobably to nothing uh which just meansthat it allows Mark and his team andnanesh and his team to pay attention tothe things that they have to continuebecause it's a five-year plan rightthere's it just keeps goingum uh right now we have hit a velocityit's not quite two weeks but I like wewas a lot of speculation it's athree-week rule yeah right it's likeit's like how do we get there and we arenot at a place where we a year ago wethought we would ever get to it'stonight fantastic yep yeah cool soum touched a little bit onum the upskilling through pairedprogramming and the two in a box uhLaura you talked about some of theTaco transformation Tuesdays and and andand popcorn some of these cleverinitiatives to talk to me uh me atArvest is uh really sort of compellinginitiative I think maybe the audiencewould learn a lot from yeah me at ourbest and if you want to know about itthere's another track that Miriam cantalk about more in uh at 3 30.um but but one of the things that'sinteresting so me at Arvest was anupskilling reskilling program that weput together but we launched it at thesame time we signed our contract withGoogleand the reason for that was you've got alot of people that our whole teamcompany had never done anything in cloudand so now you're trying to move them tocloud and so there was a lot of uh fudright fear uncertainty and doubtum can they do it will they teach mewill I still have a job uh so there wasa lot of that happening and we needed tofigure out how to stop that and so welaunched this me and Arvest program andwhat it really is is a set of roleprofiles that had learning Journeys andwe started with the real profiles thatwere associated with Cloud engineeringand data engineering on cloud so it wasthis the starting pointum and uh it was really interesting asto to do those it took us a whole yearreally to get that program we startedthat last April and it took us all theway till just probably February Marchthis year year to year to get it out tothe entire organization so we have about1200 people in my org and so it's havetechnology and have Bank operations werolled out to bank operations as wellbut a lot of that was about making surepeople knew that that we really cared wewere in it we were committed todemonstrating that we really wanted themto be a part of thisum this migrationum just so you know we didn't we didn'tcreate that we actually borrowed it froma partner uh that that actually had meat slalom created and I'd worked withthem long enough to know that it existedand said can I steal that from you willyou sell that to us and uh they werelike we've never thought about that andI was like I'd love it if you couldum so we got that um but really whatthis set us up forum was a way to start the cloudmodernization because it you know sothey'd we wanted them to learn it sothat's why I started with the cloudskills first and wanted to learn it andthen be able to practically apply uhwhat it was that they were doing thething that really then hit the nail onthe head just so you guys know so thatwe started that in whatever April wehosted a Google dayum in November uh so we were we had lotsof fits and starts with the me and ourvest we hosted a Google day in Novemberand it was literally 500 people or likeour whole technology teams plus somefolks in the bank and all day off-sitego it was like this like a mini Googleconference and it was absolutely amazingand people were super excited it's alsothe first time they'd all been in thesame room again in a long time sincecovidum and literally just so you know from ametrics perspective we saw we dosomething called our um it's a basicallyit's a drive change survey it's like areyou coming along with the transformationandum and how do you think about itrelative to the leadership helping youand you feeling like you know what yourrole is we made a 21 Point jumpfor our team for skills upskilling andreskilling 21 points they felt like theywere part of that upscilling reskillingmovement so for me that was kind of asuccess that's amazingumyeah I think when I was at Dow Jones atthe same thing it was I thought wellwe're going to move to the cloud all theIT team the technology team is going tobe super pumpedbecause they're going to get to learnnew things and it's the the novel thingand that was actually the hardest partwas getting the technology folks onboardum nadesh maybe talk so that's that'ssome amazing progress on like the talentside to maybe talk to us a little bitmore about the um the the sort oftechnical benefits and the metrics youuseI would say from a technical metricstandpoint uh you know as Laura saidearlier unlocking that data from thosedifferent data sources we've been ableto unlock at least 15data sources that we were able to bringit bring into our Google bigqueryplatform uh about you know 2000 plustables that we were able to bring in andour storage volumes you know over 400terabytes so a lot of progressum but I would say that you know this isthis is all good technical metrics butthey need toyou know deliver the business valuewhich is what Laura's looking for uh soyou know you know good data points goodum you know we've been working reallyhard to bring that all in but uh youknow it goes back to those use cases howdo we solve for those use cases and uhyou know that's the ultimate goal andthat's what we're striving for yeahmakes sense Mark anything you would addon some of the technical work underwayyeah say on this 18-month Journey youknow we've accomplished a lot so youknow we basically modernized 10applications in the GCE 7 into gke uhbuilt 245 new servers in GC and we'velifted and shifted 987 servers into gcvewe're utilizing over 20 plus new CloudSolutions and through our assessmentswe've got to and we've identified 140applications uh that we can retire infavor of new technologies so a lot ofamazing work over the last 18 monthsyeah that's amazing almost a thousandclose to a thousand soon next weekwe're probably actually next week yeahthe CSS says two weeks two weeksand threeall right uh Laura what's what's next soyou get through this transformationwhat's next what's next for the bankwe have to finish the transformationfirstyou know I'm I might be holding uh Markto uh migrating us out of our First DataCenter fully by November that'd be nextare you readyum so that's that's one of the thingswe're gonna do but I think uh you knowso a lot of the last two years so westarted this about two years ago it wasreally about building the foundation wewere you know building the foundationtrying to get some quick wins like smallquick wins along the way but buildingthe foundations on the next real bigthing is actually doing thetransformation what are the big thingswe want to doum we've partnered with Thought Machineto build out a new mint core bankingplatform rightum we've got a bunch of AI use cases uhthat we're about to roll out so we'rekind of excited about all thoseum and and really it's just now startingto show the business the value of theInvestments that we've made over thelast two years so that's what I'mexcited about I mean it's I mean rightin the next four months we'll have threegen AI use cases in production mevin yesum and so you know those to me arereally cool one of them is within ourengineering organization or within thedata team and being able to doum taking and automating a data stewardsjob uh in terms of like labeling thecolumns things that would take foreveror categorizing them I should sayanother thing is uh we're doing somestuff ask Arvest on our website as a wayto use gen AI to help customers navigatethings and want an internal version ofthat so yeah I'm excited about like I'mI'm looking short term to look long termawesome well we're super excited aboutthe transformation you're driving orgrateful to be a part of it so thank youfor doing this panel with us maybe we'llend with another show of hands whothinks it's now possible to get a bankmigrated to the cloudall right that's a big difference I'lltake it thank you so much everybody forcoming"
