speaking with our customers andthere's so much information soappreciate you taking time with oursession I know I've heard so much ongenerative AIAI and we will be talking a little bitabout that today but topic that's nearand dear is hearing from our customersthe journey that they've gone throughand how it impacts their people theirculture considerations around technologysecurity and really understanding thedecision process initially as to whythey decided to partner with Googlespecifically Google workspace fromproductivity and collaborationand then take us through some questionsthat explain in their words theseelements of culture security and andmore specifically people and the impactof that change and what it might havemeant to their culturesand so with thatam I aiming it in the right directionwe will be going through a paneldiscussion today if we have time we willdo a q a session at the end but to startoff we're gonna have questions directlyfor our our customers here todayI'd like to welcome rajnesh Avatar he'sthe CIO of HCL software Nancy mihalik VPof digital digital workplace notworkspace workplace the common Spirit wehave Adam Eric senior vice presidentemployee enablement engineering forEquifax thank you so much thank you allfor being here appreciate your timeall right let's Jump Right Inso if we look at cultural transformationis the the title of the sessionwe won't have time to go through allthese questions going to be bouncingback and forth between you if that'sokaybut first one is what was yourorganization's transformation aha momentthat made you realize you needed tochange how work was being done for yourcompany and sometimes it's notnecessarily a technology reason it canbe a number of factors but I'm going tostart with Adam at the endsure so from thecultural transformation side I think forus it was really we were in a positionwhere it was time to really make acultural transformation for the companyand it was you know it was time for usto shift the way we think about a lot ofthings and part of that wascollaboration so it was really acombination of factorsbut certainly shifting on you know howwe how our employees work together howwe collaborate you know stopping theversion 23 of an attachment to an emailwhich is just such a waste of time forso many people and really you knowdriving the culture of collaboration andcommunity and and making that pervasiveacross the company is really as part ofour overall uh you know Enterprisetransformation we really wanted to toshift think the mindset of of a lot ofour uh employee baseexcellent you feel you've achieved thatto a certain degree absolutelyum we you know we we have a significantuh uptake on the platform we have aboutum a hundred thousand ish um chatmessages a day across all mobile desktopdeviceswe haveseveral terabytes of data in in docs nowand draw and drive so it's it is ourcore platform for the company forcollaborationum and you know we have really greatfeedback from our usersdo you feel you could have achieved thesame thing with your existing partner atthe timeabsolutely notum so there's no way I meanworkspace by far is the best documentcollaboration platform that's availableon the market today and I think that isthe core of what drivesum the the change in mindset and the andthe change in how people think about howthey can work being able to work on aslide or a document at your kids soccergame in the afternoon on your mobiledevice is such a shift in how people canwork that I I just don't think the theyou know streamlined ability to do thatis available anywhere elsewell thank you appreciate that I'm gonnaswitch gears hereso there's always a conversation I haveconversations with organizations lookingto do this about change constantlychange has come up in every singleconversation I've had for folks that areconsidering making some kind of pivot orswitch so we commonly hear this andmoving a platform or a new way of ofworking is a common challenge uh inespecially to an organization's cultureright they think that this is going topotentially negatively impact theirpeople they can't shift with the changethere's a perception that I I don't knowthat their users don't do not have theability to do thiswhat's your reaction to this commonobjection I'm going to start with yourichness so maybe let me give a briefbackground of why we made the change andwho we are so I'm part of a companycalled HCL software we are a smallorganization within a larger HCL Tech IDservices company and we wanted to setour own brand okay and our own identityand we are changing almost all theplatforms within our organizationcollaboration was the first one that weare attempting moving from yourcompetition on to gws so I think it wasvery very important for us to have a newplatform with all the new capabilitiesand especially as Adam was saying aroundsupercharging this collaboration rightsimplifying all the security rules thatwe have within the organization bringingin the new technology all the Gen AIstuff that we're talking about in thisconference so for us it wasn't about thetechnology it was about the change thatpeople have to go through right and thequestion that you were asking we thinkpeople might not like change and that isreal it is true change is difficultright it really is not about technologyso much as it is about people and if wecan be very clear to them so there arethree C's right the clarity of what whywe're doing it when are we doing it howare we doing it the communication can wecontinue to communicate and overcommunicate with our people and finallythe commitment at all levels of theorganizationso those are three C's that are helpingus move in this tuneI love it um I'm gonna ask the samequestion to you Nancy but maybe a littlebit about yourself and common Spiritabsolutely well I'm Nancy mihalik andI'm the assistant vice president ofdigital workplace and service managementcommon Spirit health and common SpiritHealth was created through a merger ofDignity Health and Catholic Health Careinitiatives in early 2019 we're ahealthcare system of 140 hospitals athousand care sites and about 21 statesand as part of that merger and as wellas Other M A activity prior to ourmerger into common Spiritthere was a lot we ended up with the 13separate email environments so for us itwas a matter of looking across thoseenvironments they were not standard manyof them were end of lifeand some of the most simple tasks ofbeing able to schedule a meeting withyour peers or Associates now acrosscommon Spirit was very difficult becauseone there was not a common globaladdress and there was no calendar inIraq so there was not an ability to seewhen someone might be available for thatmeeting and so it was really importantfor us to really look at Googleworkspace and use that as a journey notto replicate the way we were workingbefore but more about creating a newenvironment a new culture transformingthe way we work and most importantlycreating that unified single platformfor communication and collaboration Imean Adam nailed it it's all about thecollaboration one of our core values atcommon spirit is collaboration andthey're really engaging with Googleworkspace was allowing us to reallyaccelerate that collaboration at postmerger as one common spiritexcellent thank youwe're going to move to the next topic umso this one Adam I'm gonna I'm gonnastart with you again what are some ofyour goals around culturaltransformation and what role doestechnology play in this and again I'dlike you togive a little about yourself as well asEquifax if you can sure sureum yeah so about myself yeah I've beenat Equifax for about five years runningthe bulk of our internal applications wehave about 24 000 end users uh prior tothis I've had similar similar roles at anumber of organizations I've done uh aworkspace implementation this is mythird one I've also done a couple otherplatform implementations on thecollaboration side certainly aroundcultural transformation and I thinkwe've touched on that a little bit butyou know I think technology can reallybe used as a lever to drive culturaltransformation it really and it's atop-down thing right it's got to comefrom the topumyou know the users need to understandthat everybody's all in we we you knowwe called our program all in with Googleuh we had our Google Champions at everysite uh you know the larger sites hadseveral that got to preview the uh theplatform before we went live we did wewent live in a big bang weekend we wemoved about 21 000 users in two daysum and you know I think once peopleunderstand that this is happening andand they they know this is going tohappen you know it's if they take itseriously they understand you know whatwe can do and that's how you get yourbest uptake right because when it comesto cultural transformation the the hardpart is never the technology if it's thetechnology something's wrong it's alwaysthe people the hard part is the peopleand and getting that cultural change inthere and getting that change managementdone so you know having a key planaround that uh is really important butcertainly you know driving that forwardand then I think people get to it aspart of the cultural change you canalways do the next iteration you canknow you can always just update yourcurrent you know your existing platformto the next version but I think when youhave a complete shift like this and youshift into a kind of a cloud-first youknow really collaborative platform itshows the the user base that the companyand they then are invested in it andthey're all in as wellor just what's your reactionyeah absolutely I mean well I completelyagree right people change is importantbut then technology helps if you look atthis technology what gws is bringing tous it's actually enabling a lot of thebarriers that people have I love thatversion 23 I was actually going to sayversion 27 but yeah version 26 or 23.um and I think the other key part ofthis ishow do we get new employees into theend organizations if you look at all theyoung Talent that's coming in everysingle person is so familiar with thisplatform so this makes the onboarding ofthe employees so much easier and thefinal thing I'll say is it also makes itvery easy if you have good partners soGoogle has been an amazing partner andthank you Pat thank you thank you theGoogle team right and Sears who's beenthe implementation partner for us so itreally really helpsfantastic thank you sorry frog in mythroatum what have you changed in terms ofprocess culture business impact andNancy I'm gonna ask you this questionwellwell star migration to Google workspaceone of the things that we implementedwas the center of excellence and it'sone thing to go live day one but we knewthat we're going to have to really helpcoach our people and how to thinkdifferently and how to use Googleworkspace and I can remember my partneris here and doing a presentation on thisin our vaccines I'm like oh we don'tneed that we don't have time for thatand it was a lifesaverum and I'm so glad that they took usalong that Journey but it really when Ilooked back over that 10-month periodpassed our migration to Google workspacewithin that 10-month period wetracked over 500 requests for helpyou know from our customers saying hey Idon't know what to do most of it wasknowledge gaps but then some of it waslike I do this now how can I do it inGoogle and that's really what we wantedto help our Associates with acrosscommon spirit is to think differentlylet's leverage thisyou know collaboration tool in ways thatwe've never thought possible and so thatCenter of accidents was really thatthat air that team that really helpedDrive our adoption and usage and reallyhelp our people to think differently onthe way they work today and how they canwork differently using Googleno 100 and I love that you branded ItCenter of Excellence we've seen it withmany customers who've done this theyhave their own branding around it butthe fact that you said it Adam earlierthe technology is is actually the easypart it's understanding the gaps foryour your folks meeting them where theyare and understanding that they did it acertain way for a very long time andthey cannot yet realize the benefits ofjust shifting the mindset a little bitwere you wanting to add a little bitthere yeah I was telling Nancy earlieryou know everybody wants change but whenchange starts to happen everybody hatesit so how do we ensure and make surethat we bring them as part of thisjourney right can we create small videosright so from our own employees who cantalk about the positive so the one thingthat I've always emphasized on focus onthe positives because we can easily getinto a rat hole of trying to say it's anApples to Apples comparison which neverthe case in technologyI'm going to jump in real quick becausewe talked about change management andthat was Key to Our Success for our golive right was change management we alltalked about the Technologies behind thescenes for technologists that's the easypart of what we do but it was all aboutthe change management and to me thecenter of excellence was just acontinuation of that change managementbut it was a different flavor and adifferent type and it was really moreHands-On my product manager is here andthey did a fantastic job of creatingdifferent ways to continue to help ourAssociates and across commissary duringthat migration I mean we talk aboutinteractive showcases where people arecoming to us showing us how they'reusing Google Now versus US showing themso it was just a continuation of thatimportant change managementand just calling it a center events justadded a different flavor to ityeah and I think you can push it downthrough the or two and I think you canreally you know sell it on the what's init for me right everyone's it's alwaysabout the what's in it for me and Ithink well that helps and I think youknow through having it you knowpervasively in the org with the Googleguide program or some sort of Center ofExcellence right it really helps drivehome the you know here's all the coolthings you can do like you can do thislike at your kids soccer game or whileyou're in the grocery store like you canhave chat that actually works and has ahistory to it and all the greatadvantages you know you can have thereand really sell that story to the usersno 100umsimilar situation you're saying whenusers come to you I remember going livewith a large retailer and we came totheir uh it was like an I.T Symposium afew months after they went live and Ihad a lineup of people that wanted toask me very specific questions about howto I used to do you moved to my cheesekind of things right we attended a yearlater what was what I loved about it wasthe excitement of people approaching mewith innovative ways that they'vechanged their own processes andworkflows so you write that excitementit starts to get viral because they'resharing so that's those are all weactually created a game as well thegooglethon uh where you know peoplecould get creative and come up withtheir own ideas and so we did that twiceand it was very successful and kind ofkept continuing that momentum and thatexcitement our program was called getgoing with Google you're all in withGoogle we ever get going with Google soit's just a matter of gamifying it alittle bit to continue that momentum andthat excitementI love thatumit's the elephant in the room I think itwouldn't be a presentation if I didn'ttalk about Ai and generative AI when wewhen we all agree okayum some amazing announcements we've seenthe launch that we saw yesterday withduet AI what I know it's relatively newand I'll let whoever wants to answerfirst but are you envisioning ways thatthis will improve the situation of yourusers potentially confuse them for thefirst little bit what are your plansfeelings thoughts feel free to share whowants to start I'll check this time okayI mean for us umwe are getting all in in AI soeverything that we do whether it is ourproducts whether it is the way weinteract from an HR perspective with ouremployees our marketing our Centralfunctions we are getting all in we'restill very early in the journey right asI said even the gws migration is we'rein the middle of it right now but it'svery very important that the way everyemployee experiences technology is goingto change the seller is not going to getinto a CRM system right everything willbe conversational uh the HR as anemployee right you don't want to go toan HR person to try to find out certainpolicies everything should be this typeof question and get the answer so we areas an organization moving towards thatand I think it's going to be a big partof our futureexcellent any comments from either ofyou yeah I think on the AI side you knowI'm very interested to see what we cando with it we have quite a few teststesters right nowand you know I think really and we'retargeting them with training and andsurveys right now hopefully we'll getusage data from Google soon it would beniceum and uh you know really understandingwho benefits the most right and andwhere that Roi is right I thinkparticularly in my mind I'm thinkingthings like the marketing space andcreating campaigns things like thatpossibly on the support side as welland auto replies and it's great foreverybody like for our program managersand product managers for meetingsummarization and no no taking so I youknow I think it's one of those things Ithink it's uh I think it's the internet1992. we're all on Prodigy andCompuServe and we need to figure outwhere it's going to goum but I'm I'm definitely excited to seeyou know the the new things that youknow we can't even think about right nowthat it can unlock and help people withand I know that uh you know if there'ssomething that can be taken advantage ofand some synergies found our users willhelp us figure out a way to find it soI'm excited for thatthat makes sense yes yeah that was justan interesting funny story that I wantedto add you know when I first startedplaying with gws and AI with duet AII actually wanted to respond to somebodywho's invited me for a meeting and Iwanted to change the timeand I asked the prompt to say pleasechange the time to two o'clock ThePrompt changed it the response was greatand I sent it the person responded backsaying wonderful I can meet you but whyare you changing it to tomorrow and Ihadn't realized that it had changed thetime right from today to tomorrow soit's very important that you know AI isgreat generative air is great but it'smy responsibility as an individual tomake sure that I verify what it hasgenerateda simple small example but I thinkthat's very crucial100 and as we talk through this there'salways we're referring to as the personin the middle right uh we're not it'snot going to be replacing someone's jobuh there was ranjan Roy who was speakingwith us yesterday from adoreme's VP ofstrategy and they put out uh about 80 80products in a month where they have towrite copy for it to write descriptionsof products and this was one person'sjob one person in their organization whowas obsessing over this but they wereable to cut what wasso much so much work every single dayfour hours down to an hour a week whichwas unbelievable so the to your pointAdam you can find these use cases but ifyou lean into themand check your workright definitely check your work work inprogress for suresoNancy I'm going to ask you this questionwhat's the one piece of advice you'dgive other leaders who may be workingthrough their own culturaltransformation well Adam hit on itearlier leader advocacy I mean we hadsupport from the our CEO and I mean hedidn't even did a video of or get goingwith Google campaign and he really gotthe whole organization excited butyou've got to have that top-down supportwe would not be successful without it soto me when you think about culturalchange now that you know we've gonethrough the change on Google workspacestill nowelevating that and making sure ourleaders are fully engaged and supportingus on continuing on this journey but Icannot adjust that leader advocacy andsupport from the highest level at theutmost importanceI would completely agree the successfulprojects we've seen they obviously haveleadership support from all sides soit's a very good point any othercomments on thoseum for me as I said the three C's areimportant it's the clarity of why we aremaking the change how we're doing itwe're not doing it why the second wasall about communication and the thirdone took Nancy's point it's about thecommitment now while we had the topcommitment all the time right now as weare getting into it it really is aboutgetting theBottoms Up from the employee commitmentgetting them to share what they're doingand building that excitementsurfacing and celebrating those storiesabsolutely it's it becomes viral rightinfectiousuh if you will 100 I'd say on the onthat side I mean you know we would wewould have a Weekly Newsletter kind of acountdown and then the last week we'dhave a daily when we were getting readyfor our big bang roulette you know Ithink another piece on you knowpreparing to go through thattransformation and setting up forsuccess I think it's always important toframe it as a cultural transformation asa transformation and how people can workand not to frame it as a cost save orsomething like that that it's onlybenefiting the business side because ifyou frame it there I think you reallylose a lot of the momentum you can getas part of it so it's always kind ofwhat what's in it for me how can wedrive it forwardand really show that that cultural shiftabsolutelyum and I didn't I didn't have this inhere but we talked previously and Adamyou and I had chatted yesterday werethere any interesting byproducts from auser experience and even security modelsor gains that you experienced as anorganization well I mean certainly fromour side you know I'm I'm very focusedand my team's very focused on beingplatform focused and simplicity rightsecurity through Simplicity in a lot ofways right so we are you know all in onon Google workspace that is our onlychat client that is our only documentclient for document collaborationum email Etc so it really allows us tofocus you know where our securityposture needs to be and working with oursecurity teamyou know I think that really helps youknow drive that forward as wellfantastic"
