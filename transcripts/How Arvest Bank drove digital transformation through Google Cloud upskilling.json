bothlearning professionalsI have here in my handthe most challenging questions that youmay ever face awesome are you ready areyou ready for these questions absolutelywe're going to talk about like I thinkArvis is a great example of bringingyour employees Along on a digitalJourney so I want to hear all about itI'm going to you ready for question onebrace yourself I hope sotell us about yourself oh this is atough questionI'm a native New Yorker born and raisedcurrently living in Dallas which has hadtriple degree heat so I'm really happyto be hereuh I'm a mom of Two And my son is in thefront rowwho is studying to be a cloud developerso I'm very very proud of him nice niceall right uh quiz question on New YorkCitywhat three foodsdo you have the moment you go back toNew York City oh my son

andthen a slice of pizza raised Pizza ofcourse the original Over by NYU where Iwent to school I am going to New YorkCity with my family in December and Iwill try to convince them to do all ofthose things at least at least once yeahyeah I accept the hot dog my wife willnot partake ever of the hot dogs I willhave the hot dog but my wife will justhave the smear and pizza nice all rightso are you ready to actually jump inlike your first real question oh thoseweren't the real ones no your first realquestion istell us about what you do at Arvest soI'm really lucky to be at Harvestum probably should back up and talk alittle bit about what Arvest Bank is uhbecause I know before 10 months ago Ihad not heard of Arvest and so we are aprivately held Bank about 26 billiondollars in assets uh and presence infour states Arkansas Kansas MissouriOklahoma okay I got those right I'm notliving in those areas I had not heard ofArvest but was super excited uh when Imet with their Chief transformationofficer and she talked to me about notonly the transformation of the bank butthe fact that the bank was going toinvest in their employees who we callAssociatesand really look to upskill and reskillthem as we went through thistransformation and when I heard that itcombined my background of userexperience along with the fact that I'ma professor at Baylor University and Iwas like how combining or experience andlearning that's the job for me and so Ijoined 10 months ago that's super coolall right well let's talk about thetransformation Journey here is a quotefrom your CTO Laura Merlingtransformation if done correctlyrequires alignment across your entirebusiness including investment dollarspriorities measurements and metrics anda path to execution so we're let's talkabout all of those things because Ithink that's a a great quote and let'sjust start withwhy did Arvest feel like it needed to goon a transformation Journey well ours isjust over 60 years old and obviously haddone very well for themselves but youknow taking a look at the landscapetaking a look at things happening asother companies were moving to the cloudthey started this was the time this wasthe time to make that transformation andLaura Merling joined to actually createthat transformation organizationawesome and apparently you're not alonebecause another slide from Gardner is 85percent of Enterprises will adopt acloud first strategy for 2020 by 2025.so let's talk about the role of Skillingin the journey and why don't you tell melike here's a multi-part question likewhat role did Skilling play in TheJourneywere employees excited about the journeywere they reticent about the journeylike how did you bring them along sureso it started before I actually joinedand so I think that that was really theinteresting part for me to join onceLaura had already made the investmentand partnered with Google to really kindof bring this all this learning to thecompany because as you can imagine acompany that hadn't already moved to thecloud now had employees who needed tolearn about it and had to be upskilledand reskilled and so we partnered veryclosely with you all we partnered withFastlane to bring us some instructor-ledtraining as well and then we had ourslalom partners that we joined with tohelp us develop a program we called meat our best which really outlined thecustomer not the customer the learner'sJourneys that were associated with theirroles that could really give them aNorth star of what path they needed tofollow in order to support the digitaltransformation of the bank how didemployees feel about going on thatJourney well as you can imagine changeis always hard sure and while it soundsexciting and transformation you knowwe're all here talking abouttransformationsounds really reallyexciting in the beginning but the secondyou talk about we need to change processwe need to change organization we needto change platforms move data migrateall of that becomes a little uh scaryand so uh the whole learning process ofthat was to really kind of give them thetransparency that we're going to giveyou the skills we're going to give youwhat it is that you need to understandyour place in this new digital Bank ofthe future when I was reading aboutArvest it seemed like there were a lotof Arvest employees who have really beenthere for a long time which is a greatkind of tribute to Who harvest isbecause the employees want to stay andlike you got to bring them with you atthat point right like things arechanging and you absolutely my bosswho's Somewhere Out There is one of themwho's been with the company since the 880s so you can imagine but the tenureseems to be double digit tenure there issuper common folks have been there somefolks have left and come back becausethey love the culture the mission talksabout people helping people findingFinancial Solutions for life and I juststopped at the people helping people Iwas just at that point I'm like okay youhad me I'm a people person so I'm justlike really instead of just kind oftalking about the bottom line it is allabout people helping people yeah I loveit yeah I love that all right so let'sdive deeper into like arvis'spartnership with Google cloud withregard to training like what can youtell us about that you know they've beengreat Partners when we started lookingat the entire program we realized folksneed to learn in different ways and oneof the most obvious ways was onlineright make it accessible make it 24 7whether you're home you're on yourtreadmill you know make making sure thatall of that was accessible but then wealso partner with our folks at Fastlanewho help us find the right instructorsto have really some live sessions sothat folks can put aside time to reallyfocus and kind of move them along thepath in a much quicker fashionon top of that we also partner withseveral of Google's vendors to provideadditional training as we start toSunset some of our old platforms andreally bring on some new ones as well soyou were talking you got multiplemodalities you've got online you've gotinstructor-led and and you've got abranded program me at Arvest is a greatlike thing that people can reallyunderstand that it's all about theemployees experience yeah I mean we liketo say it starts with me right and so ifit starts with you you know you get tokind of see what your path is you haveto drive it we bring you the content webring you that benefit and I talk a lotabout the fact that learning is abenefit it's one of those things you cantake advantage of it or not we don'tmake our learning mandatory but it'sthere for you and if you think aboutwhat the cost is I have two childrencurrently in college age the cost ofEducation uh you know here we areoffering it to our folks for freeon top of that we have support from thetop that's allowing our employees tohave up to eight hours a month indriving that personal training and wealso cover all of the costs associatedwith any certification exams as wellfrom the Google side one of the thingsthat I really liked was that there waslearning kind of structured into theplan when when it was launched and soyou know it was clear that that Arviswas making the investment up front andhad a plan to not only do the digitaltransformation but be bring theiremployees along which was super coolwhat about uh challenges what were thechallenges that you faced along the wayyeah I think early on the challengeswere you know we started off with tryingto create to do an assessment and it wasmeant to really identify where the gapswere so we knew what to offer up andthat assessment can be kind of scary youknow you have to think about theenvironment you have to really betransparent with what the purpose of itis so it made a few of our employees alittle bit nervous but I think when wefollowed up with the actual program andwe showed them how to connect those dotsthen they understood why that assessmentwas necessary nice awesome and one ofthe quote one of the part of the quotefrom Laura was aboutum was about whoopswas about measurement and metrics yesall right so what are the measurementedmetrics what have you accomplished sofar you're still on the journey yeahyou're still on the journey but how doyou measure success so reallyinteresting is I you know I've joined 10months ago so I've been very busybuilding up my team my learning directorjust joined what 120 days in I thinkand so at the mid-year we were reallyproud to start looking at somequantitative metrics we look at thehours that folks are spending and it'sbeen over 12 000 hours you know we uhjust deployed me at Arvest to 1200 ofour employees and to have over 12 000hours in the first six months of theyear I'm excited to see what they'll doin the second six monthswe've also kind of looked atcertifications that they've achieved andwe're trying to get our arms around allof that data so that not only that youknow we can recognize it and and rewardour employees but also so they can seetheir own progress and they can see howclose they're getting to this North Starnice yeah are they enjoying it are theyhaving fun are they having as much funas we're having you know so I alwaystalk about having fun no matter where weare and so we are trying to kind ofinject some of the fun into it we havesome monthly chats where we have triviaand we kind of talk about the learningthat's going on and we do giveaways toreally kind of encourage the fact thatthese folks are progressing in theirlearning Journeys we're also lookingwith Google to have a cloud hero daywhich is the whole gamification of someof this training and so I know I'mlooking forward to that nice I can tellyou're fun because you have Googlebranded fingernails yes just just forthe occasion yeah I got I have Googleshoes those are cool yeah I need tobring some of them both we both got ourGoogle swag today I really like the thefingernails all right so future what'sthe future plans for for learning atHarvest so Chris are you on thatuh yeah yeah so we do we're looking atthe next six to 18 months to really kindof understand not only the platformsthat we're bringing in but also theprogress of our folks uh one of thechallenges that we do have is reallyproviding learning at the right time sofor example if we are bringing on a newplatform you don't want to trainsomebody up front and then they're notgoing to use that platform for monthsand months later so we're working withall of our folks to understand theirneeds we're also working to create somefeedback loops really understanding whatchallenges our folks are having one ofthe things that we've heard from themagain and again is making time and sowhat we do is we go we make sure we goback to our leadership and have theirbuy-in and make sure that they'retalking about this to their folks andreally encouraging our Associates to befollowing their their own Journeysand that's terrific I love all of it I Iwant to for the people who are out therelistening to this they're probably ontheir own Journeys it's advice time likewhat advice do you have for for othercompanies who are going on a similarjourney I think that the top one is youreally need to start with your peopleyou really need to be measure you knowmentioning it to them talking to themgetting their needs understanding theirpain points you know we're going througha lot of transformation and adding onsome additional learning can be a littledaunting sure and so we are trying tofind every space possible to understandtheir fears their needs their painpoints and really kind of address thoseI think that to me is the probably thetop pointbut second to that is making sure yourleadership is tied in and really focusedand that this becomes part of whatthey're talking to their folks aboutwhether it's on their one-on-oneswhether it's at their offsides or theirmeetings Laura Merling has monthlytransformation talks and we're on thereevery other month to kind of remindfolks hey we're here and we're providingthis training for you so make sureyou're taking advantage of it what aboutgiving the employees the space as welllike I hear a lot you know from fromcustomers who their employees say okayyou want me to learn this stuff but Idon't have time yeah yeah so time isthat biggest I would say pain pointwe're trying to tie it in with some ofthe offsides that we're having we'regoing to start implementing somelearning days in the first quarter ofthe year we had monthlyiot sessions instructor-led trainingthat folks could sign up for and theyregistered for it and that reallyallowed them to block their calendar andonce they registered for it they feltokay I have to attend this and so we sawa lot of success with that in the firstquarter we're going to implement more ofthat in the second half of this year yousaid something to me before about yourown training for like Gmail trainingthat you do yes that was reallyinteresting so we've also started on theworkspace and when I was looking at allof the reporting it used to be that Iall the top classes were all GoogleCloud classes and once we made that hardcut over to the workspace the number onecourse was Gmail and I'm like why iseveryone taking this course and Iactually stopped to take it and I Ilearned a lot and one of the tips thatwe use for our folks is using that Focustime feature where it kind of shuts offany chats it kind of helps you to blockoff time on your calendar and so we'veshared that with our Associates to kindof help them start to leverage some ofthe new tools that they have at the attheir disposal I'm a huge fan ofblocking calendar yes yes you just can'tget stuff done unless you block off yourcalendar absolutely awesome that's greatand and I love the I love the journey Ireally appreciate you sharing thejourney and I think let's let's uh doyou want to take questions sure andactually what I would love to hear Toois uh you know I'm always looking tolearn so if you have some experiencesthat you're having either currently orsome success that you've had I wouldlove if you guys would come up and sharesome of your own tips and ideasuh before we do that though can I make aShameless plug for trainingokay Shameless plug for training the theupskill your your employees if you wantto check out uh Google Cloud's onlinetraining go to cloud.google.com trainingslash for teams uh and if you haven'tyet gone downstairs to check out theinnovators Hive that's down there youreally should there's drone simulationsand a certification booth and there'sbadges you can get Badges and stickersand you can collect all sorts of coolthings for your for your lanyard whichI'm not wearing uh but go downstairs andcheck it out the there there's it wasreally crowded today but I think it's areally cool space so there's my littleShameless training plug Shamelesstraining plug for Fast Lane training aswell one of our largest global trainingPartners we've been working with themfor years and they're a joyso as I suspected I mean this was agreat example of going on atransformation Journey bringing yourpeople with you I think it's reallyterrific the way Arvest has thoughtabout the whole journey the thetechnical side and the people side andcongratulations to you on this journeyit's been super great learning about theuh the experience and maybe at somepoint we can get a smear togetherexactly I hope so"
