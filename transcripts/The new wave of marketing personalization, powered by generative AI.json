generative AI for marketing weare super excited here at Google Cloudactually this week we are announcing thedata and AI Cloud for marketing my nameis Yasmine Ahmed I lead productactivation for data and analytics atGoogle Cloudsuper super thrilled to be joined withthis an esteemed panel here with metoday marketing experts in their ownright so that we can delve into thetopic of General tvi in marketingso Google Cloud we see journey I inmarketing actually changing the game formarketeers there's been a ton of dataanalysis in marketing forever in fact Iwould argue marketing is one of thosefunctions that has had the most Datacustomer Data customer 360 data acrosschannelsyet even though data scientists andanalysts have worked on that customer360 data and work to get topersonalization and that one-to-onemany times at that last hurdle ofactually communicating out to customersacross channels becomes super complexbecause a customer is not just a singlepoint channel it's a multi-channeljourney which you'll hear about todaycreating customized and personalizedcontent acouple of those channels has been nearimpossible to datebut I am super thrilled with the work wehave been doing with our partnerecosystem to launch the data and AICloud for marketingthe data in AI Cloud for marketing is acarefully curated so partnerPartnerships with data ecosystemproviders with CDP players with solutionproviders that bring marketing teams thebest in marketing in a geniei worldso without further Ado I would love tointroduce our panel so maybe actuallywe'll kick off with just everybodygiving your name your title where you'recoming fromoh you've done perfectumsouh we we spoke aboutum in one of her briefings earlier we wespoke about this idea that actuallymarketing has become super complexthere's so many different channelseverybody wants to do personalizationbut how do we deal with all of thiscomplexity because now we're talkingabout billions of interactionspotentially with many customers how dowe manage that complexity so maybe ChrisI'll come to you first because you'reactually an ex-googlerso it works at Google and dealt withsome of the marketing complexity hereand and from there you spawned your ownstartup do you want to talk about howyou think about complexity yeahabsolutelyum and the way I think about it isactually it's funny every time I talk tomy wife about what I do in marketingtechnology I say essentially to get intomarketing technology all you have to dois memorize a hundred acronyms and thenyou can be led into the club you got toknow DSP DMP SSP and then we allow youinbutunderlying that is a few simpleprinciples right now there's a fewTrends I'm seeing that actually simplifythings number one is the death of thecookie stack so a lot of marketingtechnology investment over the last 15years has been put into website trackingwhen your users are Anonymous thentrying to personalize your website andthen trying to retarget those folksthrough display ads but that entireworld is going away and it's happeningurgently cookies are going away in 2024.so what marketers are starting torealize is they actually need tounderstand their customer they need tobuild out a customer profilebut the question is where are they goingto do that they can't do it in anall-in-one marketing platform where theydon't own the data instead what they'restarting to look to is how do I actuallybuild out a unified data layer formarketing in Google bigquery in the datacloudand once that happens they're startingto think about this concept ofcomposable marketing technology whichyou might have heard aboutwhere essentially they say once I havethis unified data layer I want to bringthe business applications to dosegmentation to do Journey building todo Predictive Analytics and then to domeasurement all to that unified datalayer and then finally what acceleratesall this is the third Trend which is whywe're all here this week which isgenerative AI just accelerates thistrend if you're going to be able toleverage generative AI in your marketingthe place to do it from is that unifieddata layer so as the the cookie stack asI call it not chocolate chip cookies butyou know the other cookie stack that weall know about uh it goes away folks aregoing to urgently invest in this knowncustomer platform from the unified datalayer and we're already starting to seethat with Innovative companies alreadystarting to Trend in that direction andI think Google cloud is very wellpositioned to take advantage of the thatmomentthat's that's great Chris and we'reseeing increasingly actually customersbuilding those customer data platformssee customer Three Six Days on the datain AI cloud and as you mentionedbuilding on top of that applicationsbecause the last thing you need isanother data Silo rightand so Brian I'd love to come to youbecause Red Sox you're doing a lot moreoutbound now with fan experiences foryou guys how do you see the complexityincreasingyeah so I think as Chris had mentioned amoment ago the um you know we're all nottoo far removed from you know having uhdata it was basically kind of in thepurview of you know dbas and you knowSQL jockeys you know who kind of couldpull our data together and we kind ofall evolved a little bit you know incurrently increasing our knowledge withdata analytics groups and Reportingcapabilities and things but like to methis is the next obvious logicalEvolution if you will you know theability to be able to kind ofdemocratize the data the ability to beable to you know allow groups to allgroups you know to have exposure andvisibility into being able to kind ofcreate what-ifs you know um so itdoesn't it's not solely in the purvey ofany one kind of area per se you knowyou're still going to have yourexpertise in certain domains but like Iview kind of just the way I think oflike you know just generative AI anywaysif I'm writing I think of it as a kindof writing companion I think in themarketing space it'll become themarketing campaign you know companionyou know and being able to kind of youknow improve both the quality of ourcampaigns the personalization of our ourcampaigns you know and being able to doit in such a fashion that you know othergroups can kind of get visibility intoit without having the you know the depthof knowledge and expertise thatoftentimes is requiredthat's great and Rahul I'll come to youwith the with a similar question youknow TripAdvisor I know I have manyholidays I want to go on so there's justso many combinations actually formatching consumers with trips and andvarious different ways that you can dothat matching how do you see that showup in the marketing like landscape yeahand I think one you know the way I thinkabout this is you know we startedtalking about the complexity in themarketing world and and personalizationagain I've been in the field for so longthat you know we all know thatpersonalization Is Not A New Conceptright yet we have not cracked a nut onpersonalization uh targeting andpersonalization I mean I've been talkingabout it for the last 10 15 years but Ithink underneath that if I just reallyclick down why is it so complex why hasit been hard to make progress onpersonalization I think there's there'sthree factors for that number one Ithink about is the data and Tech uhcomplexity the number of vendors I meanChris was alluding the acronyms haveexpanded exploded right if you are amarketing organization today you have todeal with this tens of hundreds of uhdifferent vendors Partners ecosystem todeal with so I think there's somethingto be said about simplifying it makingit easier for marketers analysts datascientists whoever is working with thatdata in Tech to make it so easy thatthey can construct these experiences andmatch it with the user expectations sothere's complexity number one is aboutdata and Tech stack being being veryhard to manage right now number two isespecially I look at this uh in theworld of marketing the the desire andthe speed of campaign production andwhat the marketers want to do is notnecessarily matched by the creativeteams oftentimes I've heard there'smarketers are bottlenecked by the speedof creative production and this has beenagain I've been at different companiesin the past and even today I see that asa big problem right where if once youhave the Right audience right data youneed to have a right message a creativean image and everything to go along withthat add the speed at the scale that youwant to deploy these audiences againstright so that's number two in terms ofcomplexity and challenge is the creativevelocity and lastly I would sayI've seen where there's a greatmarketing strategy marketingorganizations I've channeled leadershave fantastic strategy but that's hardto match in terms of execution strategyright how do you think about that crossJourney cross-channel uh strategy toexecute on all the things you want hasnot that been that easy so when youthink about all these like these threechallenges uh what and would you kind ofjuxtapose that with what genitive AI cando I'm super excited because I think atleast for number one and number twogenerative AI can help in a verymaterial wayawesome andand certainly from customers I speak tothat challenge you speak about martechStacks just being so complex we'readding tools to it feels like every dayevery year those marketing Landscapesjust grow even smaller and smaller andsmaller you need a magnifying glass tosee all of these different players socertainly it's it's become verytechnology heavy very technology-centricvery complexBut ultimately it's the marketeer whohas the knowledge and the domain andexpertise of what what campaigns theywant to run and and execute so Chris I'minterested from your perspective youknow you started growth Loop because youwanted to put that power in the hands ofa marketeer instead of having thesecomplex Tech Stacks that have to be runby I.T can you talk a little bit aboutthe need that you saw the challenge yousaw and why you started growth Loop yeahabsolutely so the the major issue is Ithink marketing technology gets in theway today of what marketers actuallywant to do fundamentally you just wantto speak to your customers you just havea lot of customers to speak to and so weput in 30 layers of technology to helpyou do that and when I go back about adozen years I worked in marketing atGoogle as you mentioned and I workedessentially to send email campaigns andwhat I realized I was a youngwhippersnapper you know I had my nooglerhat on I don't know if you've ever seenthose with the spinny things on top onsocial media but I was very excited Isaid you know what I'm going to do myjob was to raise 365 day Revenue thatwas my kpi and I said how am I going todo that well I'm going to come in andI'm going to run 100 experiments we haveover a hundred thousand customers I'mgoing to split them into 20 segments andI'm gonna run five experiments persegment in a customer journey and I'mgoing to hit my goal and you know it wasthe folks were sitting at the desk andthey're like well this kid hasn't metmarketing technology before and and so Istarted on my first campaign I had to goto the data analytics team and say hey Ireally love to Target this one audiencehow do we go about doing that they'relike well I'm going to write some sequelI'm going to stitch together data I'llsee you in about two weeks your audienceis going to be too small you're going toask me to go back to the drawing boardand we'll do that over and over againuntil we get it right then I'm going togive you a CSV you're going to load itinto the email tool you're going to goto your brand agency they're going towrite a brief they're going to createHTML you're going to load that into thetool and what I realized was oh I thinkI'm a project manager I'm actually not Idon't know how to do marketing here andso I could get one campaign out the doorbut I couldn't get there was no chanceof getting a hundred so the reason westarted growth Loop was to fundamentallysolve that problem I wanted thetechnology to fall away I wanted amarketer like myself to be able to use aself-service UI to create those 20segments that shouldn't be that hard itshould be a few clicks of the button ontop of bigquery to create those audiencesegments if I want to generate a journeyacross the marketing channels I alreadydo that should be easy too I should beable to create a journey across Braysacross salesforcement marketing Cloud aclass across my push notification inGoogle ads very easily in a visualinterface and then finally my favoritestep of the whole process was I wouldrun these campaigns right and then Iwould go beg for analytics resources tosay can you just tell me what happenedlike I know there was opens and clicksbut can we just see what happened torevenue I would love to see whathappened to revenue and they're likewell you know you start a jira ticketyou know we'll see if we can get to thatexperiment and and so what we wanted todo with growth was just automate thatprocess if you're going to scale theamount of experiments you run you alsowant to be able to measure themautomatically on Revenue in bigquery soif you solve each of those steps whatyou're effectively doing is saying thatyoung kid coming into your organizationcan actually Run 100 experiments now thenext issue though is exactly what youyou touched on Rahul is once you'recreating 100 experiments what's theissue a lot of our customers will startto scale the amount of experiments theycan run and then they say but mycreative team can only do three HTMLemails so what are we going to doand and that's why it was almost like aromantic comedy when I met Fishel forthe first time you know we were runningin the rain and I was like I didn't knowI was always looking for typeface butI've now found you you know everybody'ssitting there with their hundreds ofsegments and they couldn't create thecreative and that's why we're so excitedabout the partnership because it bringsit homeand I'd love to actually come to youMichelle becauseyou've similarly recently now with JennyI've seen a similar challenge in themarketing landscape that you're goingafter to reduce again complexity can youtalk about how marketing Jenny I cameabout for typefaceuh no thank you yeah so I think Chrisdid a very good job of covering thesurface here so I think if we look at itright if we just look at how data hasevolved we've talked a lot about dataand there has been a lot of investmentsin data disparate data Stacks have cometogether there's a lot more you can dowith data but then ultimately to Chris'spoint if you can't create the creativewhat good is that to me from a marketingperspective and I think we talked to wemust have talked like 100 plus CMOS overthe last few months and we saw a fewTrends clearly emerged right one was heyhow does you how do you actually createcontent today and we realize there istwo ways people do that and sometimesthere is 15 but I'll just summarize intwo different buckets so one is what westarted calling the brand Loop so theidea there is I have a I'm a CMO I havea budget I hire an agency I create PixelPerfect on-brand content and and it'sthe massive amount of content I createthat's the content that goes on all myPremier destinations but then on theother end of the spectrum all thesechannels are evolving so so fast topicsare changing by the hour they're notchanging by the week so I don't havethose six weeks anymore so and then whatdo you do marketers tend to kind of do adifferent Loop which is kind of what wecall the velocity Loop so sometimeswherever you're allowed to you will goquickly to to can what to cook up animage or go to some stock photography todo a quick photograph and find that anduse it you will write the copy yourselfbut the challenge of that is of courseit is speed and it is very fast it's noton brand and these two Loops today inmost organizations don't talk to eachother so there's no way for thisvelocity loop with what we call it tokind of get inspired by the brand Loopand why hasn't it happened so far so webelieve there was a foundationaltechnology piece that was really missingto create content at scale and that'skind of what generative AI does nowgenerative AI still has a lot of thingsof things to be done and we'll talk moreabout that but at a higher level for thevery first time now you are able tocreate content so if you can build aunified content Hub just like we didwith data in an organization where youlearn from your branded content use itto create velocity content fast I thinkthat's kind of where the Holy Grail isthen you can massively unlock data youcan run experiments at scale and you cankind of do constant evolution of datait's not like every two weeks I go to anagency and get new content in it none ofthose things go away agencies are verymuch needed the velocity Loop is verymuch needed but how do you bring all ofthese together to can kind of createbranded content at scale I think that'sgoing to be the foundationaltransformation here wonderfuluh so Brian coming to you because I knowfor you it's been at Red Sox it's beenan imperative to actually get yourmarketers the tools in their hands sothat they can help that Fan Experiencedeliver the Best in Class experience howhave you found that experience I knowyour user also growth Loopyeah so we um we we've been using growthLoop now for about three and a halfyears uh very successfully they'vehelped us kind of orchestrate ourinitial kind of cloud Enterpriseenvironment so get that 360 degree viewof the customer the fan kind of in ourour worldum you know but but we have kind of acomplex world too you know we're veryintegratedum in critical relationship with MajorLeague Baseball you know for how we do alot of our campaigns we also have a verysophisticated Salesforce environment andso for us trying to find solutions thatcould solve both problems was reallykind of high on our list and you know aswe think about how we do outbound salescampaigns and how do we kind of reachthe right targeted audiences whetherit's with you know digital products orDigital Services you know or in the formof kind of you know working with thesales teams and things like that youknow it obviously kind of started withgetting our arms around our environmentour data our tools and things but youknow we've kind of taken it I think tothe Naturalum level of where that can go like we'vekind of not so much reached a you knowproblem uh wall so to speak but I don'tthink it's it's if you look forward youcan certainly see that you know there'sso much opportunity so much morepersonalization moving beyond personasyou know the ability to be able tocreate as you alluded to with typefaceyou know more on-brand content more onbrand sort of campaigns and things likethat in order to sort of be able to kindof keep up with the volume of Demandsacross multiple different audiencessectors and things like that so we'resuper excited and you know the group offolks for us have been a um have reallybeen kind of the impetus to kind ofreally kind of help solve these problemsfor us so we're we're excited that youknow they partnered with with Best inClass companies like Google obviouslyand typeface and others you know kind ofdeliver the products that you know wecontinue to make us successful so wethink AI is a very natural extension forus and we're super excited about whatthat meansyeah wonderful and I'd love to touchagain back on what Michelle was talkingabout with the generative AI contentthere's just the ability to scale in away that that's not possible before soRahul may be coming to you because Iknow with TripAdvisor again there's lotsof potential wonderful imagery that canbe used to sell those trips to thoseexotic locations how do you see Jenny Iplaying a role with content creation andmarketing it's it's massive I mean evenI'll uh before just going to get intosome of those details I'll sharehow you know the scale of data and thescale of complexity at TripAdvisor sotriple that we have uh 400 million plusmonthly active users across all theregions all the countries in the worlduh billion plus reviews on in the totaluh million plus reviews getting createduh every month uh and then 10 millionplus businesses and when you think aboutthat scale that many users that manyit's a multi-sided marketplace whereeverybody was interested in to travel iscoming to a Trip Advisor so thechallenge for us is how do you thinkabout understanding the intent of theperson who's visiting whether it's atraveler is a partner is a hotel chainis a travel company whoever is visitingunderstanding that intent and andmatching that intent with the rightmessage to drive personalization and andthis is where I you know what I wasalluding earlier that those channelsbecome quite magnified at that scale andso and in these areas where I feel genAI has been and can play a massive rolefor us right when you try to understanduh the audience context and having thethe segmentation the under like theaudiences creating audiences at scale iswhere we're starting to think about howto do that with with AI right a lot moreusing uh that uh technology to createthese audiences at scale they areupdatedI would say real not real time yet buton a daily basis right and then matchingthat audiences with the right type ofcontent so that we can push thispersonalization at scale and then applytesting and a b testing andexperimentation and measurementframework on top of that so I think inthese like the chain that I mentioned uhcertainly the audience creation uh withthe creative creation and doing that atscale and measurement is we're applyinggenerative AI right nowamazing one of those 400 million usersas active users is definitely me as Ilook to my next vacationto what you said one of themost important pieces and connectionpoints is the what you talked about withthe velocity Loop and then the contentLoop if you can do the audiences to thecreative so one of the things we've beenworking heavily on in this partnershipis what we're calling Persona promptsand the idea is if you go into Bardtoday and you say hey I want you towrite me a churn winback email you'regoing to get a generic answer back it'sgoing to be pretty good but it's notgoing to be to your business right andso one of the most effective thingsabout the the product partnership thatwe've launched here together is to sayif you're achieving velocity in terms ofyour segmentation that should actuallycreate a very rich prompt for yourgenerative AI om and typeface togenerate the creative personalized tothat audience right so you can provide afull Rich profile from the locationspeople are in what are they buying whatdo they prefer in terms of channels whenthey're in provide that as a part of theaudience as a prompt to the llm I thinkthat's really where generative AI isgoing to go is richer promptsthat's awesome I know the other day whenwe debated about does Jenny eye contentreally cut it does it look realisticenough will will consumers respond to itum Brian you'd made a comment of wedon't need the content to win an Emmycan you can you talk about how you seeis the content good enough from JourneyI for your marketing campaignsum well I think that comment uh you knowI'm sure there's some marketing folksnow going like hey we want to win butthe um you know I I think just beingrealistic there's so many can'tdifferent flavors of campaigns that wewe want to put out and I think you knowwe want to make them more personalizedwe want to maybe make sure like everyonethat we're kind of hitting our targetaudience appropriately type of thing andand the reality is is that I think themore important thing is something yousaid which is you want it on brand likeyou know I think the key thing is beingon brand you know it's it's yeah I meanwe have different levels of campaignswhere some are going to be moresophisticated and whatnot than othersbut they should all resonate relative tolike our kind of brand promise if youwill and so to me I think that's kind ofreally kind of the Holy Grail of gettingthat part right and um and I think youknow generally I I think um I mean youknow I think it's sort of a you knowthis crawl walk run I'd like to thinkwe're maybe in jog you know a little bitbut um you know but it's um I think partof the thing is it's an accelerant likeis what I'm looking at it it's not it'snot like a finished product for me totoday but it's it's an accelerant andit's it gives people sort of the abilityto kind of get them closer to the thepromise if you will I think ultimatelythe end objective is to reduce cycletime you know whether whichever formthat takes and to me this is another wayof getting there and as I said before itkind of doing kind of a democratizedfashion where you know at the end of theday your your key people are going to bethe ones making some of the finaldecisions but you know I just feel likewe're evolving to the point where youknow we can do much much more letdifferent groups you know create theirown hypothesis about audiences that areclosest to it let them you know runthese kind of almost kind of In-Housesort of equivalent of campaigns you knowbefore as opposed to having tonecessarily make that sort of I thinkthe whole challenge we all deal with isis the is the whole funnel and how do wekind of create you know you knowblockage in this whole Pipeline and Ithink it's it Jennifer day I think willdo a long go a long ways towards freeingup a lot of thatand we saw actually in the keynoteyesterday with Thomas there was a demothat showed that kind of branding likehow do you bring a certain kind of toneto to the images it could be a brandtone a brand voice a brand message tooto the generative AI content and I knowit typeface that's actually somethingthat that typeface is really focused onof it's not just going to be Jenny Icreating stock images it's going to beJenny eye quitting images that arecrossed with your brand your brand voiceyour brand image Michelle can you talk alittle bit about why that was soimportantyeah I think going back to what Brianwas saying just a minute ago right so ifyou look at thisyou can do a lot of different kind ofcontent today and actually I'll tell youa little funny story we started typefaceright before any of this chat GPTRevolution happened and it wasn't evenclear if we are going to be able togenerate good quality images like thisis like really really no realfoundational model existed in imagingand just in the last nine months we havecome such a long way that we are nowproducing really good images I willencourage you to come to our stall hereand just check it out these are somereally fabulous images so this qualityis a very moving Target right now whatis very very important is how do werepresent your Brand's products I alwayssay like four kinds of personalizationwe need to do one is around yourproducts second is around your voice andstyle the third is around your audiencesand how do we create audience and thefourth is around your channels so all ofthat because the brand might be asingular brand but I don't talk the sameway I talk on my website the way I talkon Twitter or into Instagram or Googleads is there all different brand voicesis there's not just single bandwidth sojust being able to really quicklycapture that with a few simple questionsforms and then being able to apply atscale is kind of a problem if we solveand we solve well that is where themassive unlock is so one point I wouldadd I mean when you talk about contentwe talk about images but we at least sofar haven't talked enough about the thetext part of it right and if you thinkabout an ad copy uh the text becomessuch an important aspect of it right uhwhether it be if you're looking at emailand there's like how you think of thesubject headline how you think about thesummary Snippets that go at differentparts of that image or even just thecore Snippets of uh content textualcontent that you can use in differentmarketing so one of the ways we aretrying to leverage Nai is taking theseSnippets of textual summaries and usingthat in different uh different marketingaspects different personalization whenwe launch our trip planning app with GenAI we're taking all these summaries andincluding them in the recommendationthat comes out of our version of tripplanning so I would highly encourage allof you to think about like when youthink of gen AI applications andmarketing image absolutely is oneobviously audience segmentation isanother one but just think about eventhe uh the textual part of it if youhave content already available in termsof your unstructured data and text usingthat and summarize fashion could giveyou a lot of a big Roi yeah and I thinkI'm going to build on that a little bitso one of the things once again wetalked to marketers and they tell us heyI don't have a problem of content I meanI'm just gonna now I'm just gonna regretsaying that but I actually have aproblem of scaling my content so youusually have something you have a webpage you might have a video you mighthave a creative brief you might havesomething so now how do you take it andfrom a YouTube video how do you createan announcement email how do you createa blog how do you create a newsletter sothis personalization to 10 differentchannels from a single asset that'swhere generative air can really helps sowe have a template in types you justgive a YouTube link tell us what youwant to rewrite into which voice youwant to use and we will just do that foryou right so just this part of it andthen on top of that every single channelhas multiple audiences now this becomesa 10x to 100x problem very very fast andthat's really to Raul's point one areawhere excuse me where generator isdefinitely kind of clicking the markright now and it's just it's alreadythere like so you should try itI love that we moved into this space ofactually how do you orchestrate thiscontent now across so many differentchannels because it's one thing buildingone piece of content but as we thinkabout these channels Michelle as you'rementioning each Channel actually needs adifferent format if you're putting anInstagram post out there versus you'resending somebody an email campaignversus you have an SEO search those areall different formats of content and andactually Jenny I today can help yougenerate all of those differentvarieties of content it's not justcontent for different audiences orindividuals it's content by Channel byaudiencebut that suddenly leads to like oh mygosh that's millions of pieces ofcontent now in text form image formtweet form combinations it's it's justso much different content now to reachaudiences so you hit this complexity oforchestrating so I know growth Loop hasreally been focusing on this idea ofmulti-channel orchestration of Journeysand and the partnership here with growthLoop and typefaces about taking now allof this General to be high content andfiguring out which channel to put it oncan you talk a little to that Chris yeahabsolutely so if you think about acustomer Journey today a lot ofcompanies they already have an existingmarketing technology stack so they mayuse Salesforce marketing Cloud attentivefor push notification you might use adifferent tool for SMS and marketerstend to love those tools because they'vecut their teeth on them and they want touse them and so when you think about acustomer journey in orchestratingcontent as well as the audiences acrosschannels you need to use that currentmarketing technology stack you actuallywant to bring the capability to theexisting stack you don't want to makeeverybody go all in on a totallydifferent platform and do an 18-monthmigration and so the way we think aboutit is if you actually can generate theaudience segments and create a customerJourney that orchestrates across thosechannels directly from bigquery thenfeed those audiences in the steps ofthat journey into a powerful creativecapability like typeface you cangenerate creative for each step and thenthe audience for that step in thejourney as well as the creative go tothe tool you already use so you don'tneed to switch you've just brought thecapability of what we're talking aboutfrom going one manual customer Journeyend to end to actually being able toscale it yeah wonderfulso a mate we've talked about amazingtechnology in the Jenny eye space but asyou said Vishal the space is just movingsuper fast things are being developedand innovated every day and you saw fromthe demos at the keynote yesterday youknow you could be playing with thisstuff on Google Cloud today andgenerating images and so on I'd love totalkare you thinking about a decision aroundbuilding it yourself and going to GoogleCloud directly and vertex AI modelsversus partnering versus buyingSolutions where where do you fall onum your marketing teams just evengetting started because for a lot ofpeople it's that first step of how doyou even get started so maybe I'll cometo yourself Rahul firstyeah so the way we are thinking and I'mthinking about this right now isuh if you're thinking of all thegenerative AI applications even if as amarketing team or even outside of amarketing domain there's multipleapplications of generative AI the way wehave bucketed our Define our strategy isthere are certain applications wherewe're looking at directly creating forour Travelers and our our businesspartners right so this is where tripplanningum search uh some of the bigapplications we are working ourselvesbut also working with part so that's thecore part of our strategy and thenthere's other applications we'rethinking how can we accelerate uh whatwe have been doing already and this iswhere we are very much open to workingwith uh with Partners right uh becausethis is where I feel like there'scompanies uh and partners such as youknow folks here have spent enough timeand expertise in building theseapplications so with that uh expertiseand deep thinking we can get a quickacceleration so I would say we arethinking in on both in certain areas ofgenerative AI uh taking a buildingdirectly with some of the foundationalmodels and in some of the fine-tuning orprompt engineering and some areas wherewe are really partnering very closely uhwith typeface group that's this is wherewe're thinking about it great over toyou Brian yeah so um I guess in somesimilar ways I think right now it's tooearly to kind of pick any one obviouslysolution so it's a big it's an and youknow MLB is doing some very Progressivework with Adobeum you know Chris said to us is you knowwith Chris at a moment ago was reallyimportant which is you know we're tryingto find solutions that kind of extendacross all of our different you knowum campaigns and all of our differentplatforms and things like that so it'llwind up being um a bit of a hybrid insome respects but I think the key thingwe're trying to do is is keep theintelligence you know centralized so thedecision making can be you know housedin one location we can do a lot of thesedifferent sort of what-if analysis wecan democratize these capabilities morebroadly socialize them you know across abroader reach for us you know and thenkind of use the tool to trade you knowto kind of deliver the audiences collectthe results make decisions you know youknow continue to sort of you know rinseand repeat a little bit so um so when Ithink the Journey part of it I thinkit's going to beum you know a hybrid of different thingsfor us I mean we work very closely withgrowth loop we're excited about thetypeface component um we're doing somevery sophisticated work on theSalesforce side we're looking tocontinue that and then you know partnerwith our friends from MLB on some of thedigital platforms so there's a lot aheadI think uh keeping your options open isa great strategy right now and at GoogleCloudI mean for our data in AI Cloud we'revery proud of being an open Cloudbecause we know there's the teams thatwill come and build directly on GoogleCloud they have the skills they'rethey're innovating in the space and thenthere's the partner ecosystem is soimportant to us because I think Rahul asyou mentioned there's just so muchInnovation happening in this space thelikes of growth Loop typeface they'reworking through all of the challengesthat come with prompt engineering how doyou apply in large language modeleffectively so there's there's also thisvibrant partner ecosystem that is thatis evolving and bringing solutions toMarket soum I think that multi-prong approachmakes sense especially where we areright now in the journeyso last question across the panel sowould love to hear your thoughts on whatdo you think is the next bit big wave inmarketing if we have Jenny I what do youthink that's going to unlock thepossibilities or maybe it's not Jennyeye and it's something else I'll startwith Vishalno that's a great question I think I Iwould just saylot of things are going to be verydifferent like once you connect like thedata world looks very different thanwhat it looked 10 years ago and contentworld is going to look very differentvery shortly here so I think the the keyhere is how do you kind of digest all ofthis and find scenarios that work verywell today but kind of keep an open mindand and let it go where it is going andkind of try to see whether it goes butto me all the ways you do Journeys to doyou do a b experimentation all of thatis going to dramatically change like youdo a b experimentation because you couldonly do two creators so you would putone out there and another one out thereand see which one works and you willscale that one that worked but now ifyou are able to generate this brandcontent at scale there is no limit todoing that right you can actually have aconstantly evolving piece of content youcan see what works you can understandwhat works because it's not an opaqueobject anymore learn from that createeven better and try it very quickly sothis this world of how you put contentout there is going to be a constant Loopinstead of a a b testing experiment kindof loop that's one thing I will leavethere's lots of other things and we cantalk but we're gonna have not haveenough time but but that's definitelyone thing I feel that will change veryinteresting we're moving from a btesting to alphabet testing maybe evenalphabetsum Rahul over to youyes I mean next big wave of innovation Ithink it'll be a little bit of asimpler answer to that I mean nobuzzword answer but I think this isgoing to be a wave of uh automationright and that automate wave ofautomation powered by uh llm'sgenerative AI technology uh behind itbecause the way I see this in a Trendsespecially we look at gen Ai and llmswhat they can do today is materiallydifferent and better than what somebodywould have thought researcher would havethought six months one year two yearsback right obviously we know theapplications of large language models inthe areas of marketing we're talkingabout right now but even the traditionalor not traditional like some of theearlier deep learning models how we lookat personalization recommendationsystems how you look at your uh modelingin different worlds of AI all of that iswhere llms are having a huge impactalready so what I see is powered bythese LMS and how they are improving andgetting better every single day that canunlock a lot of automation for everyworkflow and that'll be a huge one yeahI think briefly I just I would say thesame thing I think automation's theanswer I think um it's also building ona multi-year road map because and Ithink it's a lot more experimentingbecause there's these things arechanging so quickly it's difficult tosort of Define sort of you know theobvious path forward so I think it'sgoing to put a lot of pressure on all ofus to kind of understand sort of youknow to raise our game a little bit tokind of become more cognizant of whatthe options are out there and how theyintegrate but I think building that sortof road map that architectural systemthat kind of ties all this together tocreate those sophisticated Journeys Ithink is the Holy Grailways or game because it creates so muchmore optionality out thereChris finally with you yesyeah so I I think if you fast forwardthis over the next three yearsgenerative AI is going to make thetechnology fall away it's going to makethe technology disappear for marketerswell empowering them so when somebodywalks in and says I actually want to runa thousand experiments to hit my kpiwhich is 365 day Revenue you knowthere's not Chuckles in the room it'sactually possible and it becomes anactual conversation for the marketer tosay I want to Target everybody likely tobuy jeans in the next three weeks giveme five segmentsit presents five segments back to youand it gives you a report about them yousay I want to break those down into fivesub segments for the top Geo locationsnow you have 25 segments then you say Iwant you to create two Journey optionsper segment now you have 50 Journeys andI want you to generate the creative foremail and push notification for thatJourney then please run the journeys andthen based on the winning Journey foreach of those 25 sub-segments start toreallocate traffic and actually optimizeto my kpi that's when we know generativeAI has lived at its full potential isyou can run those thousand experimentsand you don't actually have to learn SQLin HTML amazing I can't wait for thatfuture thank you so much Vishal ChrisRahul Brian for joining us on this paneland thank you to the audience forkicking off day two here with the nextwave of marketing with Jenny I thank youthank you"
