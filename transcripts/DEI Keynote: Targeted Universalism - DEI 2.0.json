    "transcript": "[MUSIC PLAYING]MELANIE PARKER: Good afternoon, everyone.Welcome to the Google Cloud Next '23 DEIKeynote focused on targeted universalism, whichis really DEI 2.0.I'm Melanie Parker.I'm Google's chief diversity officer.And I am so excited to be here with you today.I'm here with two incredible peoplethat I'm going to introduce.First, john a. powell is a law professor,director of the UC Berkeley Othering and BelongingInstitute. john comes from an incredible backgroundof championing DEI prior to Berkeley,including his time as the national legal directorfor ACLU, the founder and directorof the Institute on Race and Povertyat the University of Minnesota.And john also served as the executive directorof the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicityat Ohio State University.Additionally, I'm joined by Juan Rajlin,who is Google's Alphabet VP and treasurer.Juan and I have partnered togetheron a number of projects to advance DEI.He spearheads many of Google's effortsto create economic opportunity for communitiesin truly an equitable way through impact investments.And outside of his very busy roleas the treasurer of Google, Juan alsorepresents Google on the corporate boards of UnidosUS,which is the largest Latino civil rightsorganization in the United States,as well as co-leading DEI for our Google Finance Function.And then Juan also co-heads our Pride at Google EmployeeResource Group, which supports our LGBTQ+ community.So today's discussion is really going to be a powerful one.We're going to dive into many aspects of DEIwith a particular focus on belonging, on creating impact.And we're going to talk about, whatdoes the future of diversity, equity, and inclusion looklike?And how can all of you help move the needle towards what we'recalling DEI 2.0 in both your professionalbut your personal lives, as well?So we're going to get this conversation started.But before we really dive into the heart of the conversation,I thought it would be really important justto share a little bit about myself.For those of you that are visually impaired,I am a Black woman.I have on a blush colored dress.I have shoulder-length, dark-brown hair.In addition to that, though, I am a mom.I'm a daughter.I'm a brand new Gigi to my granddaughter, Noelle.I'm a knitter.I'm a quilter.And so that's just a little bit about who I am.So, john and Juan, I'm going to turn it to you to sharea little bit about who you are.JOHN A. POWELL: Good afternoon.It's great to be here.I'll share a little bit about myself.As Melanie said, I teach over at UC Berkeleyand run the Institute.I also have three children.And for those who can't see me sitting down, I'm tall,a little over 6 feet, about 6' 3\", African-American.I use mainly he/him pronouns.I used to be a world-class runner.You wouldn't know it if you saw me walking across the stagetoday, but it's true.It was just a long, long time ago.And it's really a delight to be here.JUAN RAJLIN: All right, I'm delighted to be herewith all of you.So I am a gay man.So I use the pronouns he/him.Originally from Argentina.Came to this country 25 years ago for school.And so I'm an immigrant, as well,and a member of our Latino community in the US.And I'm also a dad of a beautiful six-year-olddaughter.MELANIE PARKER: Thank you, thank you.Well, I thought we'd start by hearing a little bit about,how did each of you really get into the important workthat we do in diversity, equity, and inclusion?And in talking about that, if you could talk about,what have you seen around the evolution of DEI itselfas you began your involvement in the space?So, john, we can start with you.JOHN A. POWELL: It's interesting to thinkabout the evolution of DEI.I was just at an event with Melanie a few weeks ago.And they sort of mapped out how in the '70s and '80swe talked about tolerance and involvement.No one uses that phrase anymore.We moved beyond tolerance.And then we talked about diversity.And at some point, someone said diversity by itselfis not enough.We need inclusion, and we need equity.So I think it's a natural evolution.And for myself, I've been part of virtually allof those evolutions, going back to high school.I say to people often times the evolutionfrom inclusion, tolerance, to belongingto me is a natural evolution.And I'm sixth of nine children.I watched my siblings be tracked away from college prep, trackedinto certain things.I was growing up in Detroit, so tracked to the automobileindustry.And I knew it was wrong.And as I grew, I found it was not just my family.It was happening to people all over the world.Finally, I'll say when I came here to Berkeley 11 years agoto start this Institute, there wasseven clusters, one on race, one on gender,one on sexual orientation, one on economics, one on religion.And I felt like they were all sort of dealing with somethingbut waving at each other.They didn't see the deep, underlying common structurethat they all were fighting, that they all were engaging.And to me, that deep underlying structurewas a structure of being othered.And the solution to othering, as I say,is not saming, but belonging.So to me, that sort of evolution was a natural one.And I think it goes back to, in some ways, whenI was in high school.MELANIE PARKER: Thank you.I mean, it also talks about pattern recognitionand the patterns that you were able to see and recognizeand how those have evolved, as well, whichis really important.JOHN A. POWELL: Yeah.MELANIE PARKER: Juan?JUAN RAJLIN: So for me, I would say my workwith DEI started 10 years ago when I joinedthe board of an organization.It's a nonprofit called the Posse Foundation,which, Melanie, you are a fellow board member of.And it's an organization focused on giving broader accessto kids to go to college.So we send kids in groups of 10, in posses, to 60 of the top 100schools in the US.And the notion is that the kids--with full scholarships.And the kids that Posse sends to schoolsare typically overlooked by the traditional admissions process.Most are first-generation, 80% are diverse,coming from diverse communities.And the idea of this organizationstarted when the founder had a conversation with a collegedropout who said to her, I would have neverdropped out of college if I had my posse with me.So that's the notion.And Posse scholars graduate at a rate of 90%.By the time they are seniors, 80% of them leading on campus.They're officers of campus organizations.So you could see how having a support system,having belonging, if you will, when you arrive at a place--if you're first-generation, it's kind of a new place for you.You may look different than most of the students on campus.It's very easy to feel othered and to feellike you don't belong, right?Yet if you have a group, if you have a supportsystem, if you have belonging, you could feel comfortable.If you feel comfortable, you can gain confidence.If you gain confidence, you can startto contribute and then thrive, whichis what happens to these kids.So I saw firsthand 10 years ago, when I joined thisorganization-- it wasn't called \"belonging\" 10 years ago,but that's what it was--the power of combining broader access to opportunitywith a system where you can actually have a support systemand belong.And if you combine those two things, magic really happens.So that's the origin of my interestin being involved in DEI.So here we are.Excited for this conversation today.MELANIE PARKER: Thank you.Me, too.And I know you out in the audience are, as well.So there are a few important topicsthat we're going to cover.And I thought it would be really important to startby reflecting on what's happened in the recent past few yearsand the impact that things like COVID--there's the Stop Asian Hate movement, the brutal murderof George Floyd.And there are numerous other eventsthat we could all point to that have changedthe landscape of DEI but also really put itunder greater scrutiny.So recognizing not everybody experienceseverything in the same way.So even the things that I talked about,we've not all experienced them the same,because we're different.We're from different cities, different cultures,different backgrounds, et cetera,which is all really important to acknowledge.But I was thinking, john, if you could tell usabout some of the ways you've seena shift in how people have experienced diversityand inclusion in these moments.JOHN A. POWELL: I think that's really important.We're situated differently.And there's stuff going on in the country and the world thataffects us differently.And how we talk about it, how we think about things matter.So for example, you mentioned COVID.I worked a little bit with World Health Organization.And as you know, when they first came out with COVID,they talked about social distance,to keep social distance.And I literally wrote them and said,you mean physical distance.We need to have social solidarity.It was too late.The social distances were already out there.And that created this space where peoplewere afraid of each other.And we are radically social animals.Think about this.All of us were born attached to another human being,not metaphorically, actually.And even though the umbilical cord was cut,the spiritual cord was never cut.And yet we do these practices to say to certain people,you don't belong.And as Juan suggested, when you don't belong, you don't thrive.So in some ways, when we think about COVID or George Floyd,these are all expressions saying, not justyou as an individual, but you and people who look like youor people who worship like you or people who love like you,they don't belong.Now, what's happening in terms of, I think,a backlash, which is happening, isthat as the country becomes and the world becomes more diverse,some people who were used to being in a dominant roleare saying, do I belong in this new world?In a sense, the fight around DEI is a fight around who belongs.And what we say--and I'd like to paraphrase the Declaration of Independence.It says, \"We hold these truths\"--we hold these truths--truths-- \"to be self-evident\"--it's not necessary to prove it; they'reself-evident-- \"that all men are created equal.\"OK, all right, so they screwed up.It should have been \"all people.\"That's a powerful statement, eventhough one of the authors of that was Thomas Jeffersonand he had 600 slaves.It's still a powerful statement.What I think we're struggling with today is,can we say it is self-evident that every human being belongs?That every human being belongs?And some people would say, of course.Other people would say, not so fast.I'll end just with thinking about the most important case,anti-civil-rights case, you could say, in UShistory is Dred Scott.In that case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice Taney said,Black people, free or otherwise, could neverbe part of the political community of the United States,never.He was saying they could never belong.So in a sense, that struggle of whois the \"we,\" who belongs, who does not belong is powerful.It happens at Google.It happens at our church.It happens at our neighborhood.And to me, that's the battle that we have to fight.And it's punctuated when we think of thingslike COVID and George Floyd.MELANIE PARKER: That's powerful.Thank you for sharing that.Juan, I know you spend a lot of timethinking about and helping advance DEI across Google.When you think about impacting change, what sort of shiftdid you see in how that was approachedin response to some of these larger cultural moments?And how do you perceive the importance of leadershipfrom companies like Google?JUAN RAJLIN: Yeah.Yes, I think for us 2020 was a pivotal time, right?We had the pandemic first in the springand then the murder of George Floyd in the summer.And we were, of course, called to actionas a result of what was going on.And what we wanted to do was ask ourselves,where can we have an impact given who we are, givenour capabilities, our assets?So very quickly when the pandemic hit,we concluded small businesses were going to be--potentially have a devastating impact.Within small businesses, small businessesfor diverse communities were going to be more vulnerable.And small businesses are such an important part of our products,given our ecosystem.So that was an area that we felt we wanted to lean in.And then the other area is digital skills.So in particular, when you think about jobs,2/3 of job openings in the US todayrequire some level of digital skills.So you can't think about jobs in this countryunless you think about digital skills.So we felt that economic opportunitywas a banner under which we could do workon both of these areas.That's where we focused, and we did it in a waywhere, in addition to our products,we also wanted to do our part with our balance sheet,as well.So overall, we committed, since 2020,almost half a billion dollars in programs and investment fundsthat are designed to support these areas.So what are the kinds of things that we did?We set up a fund to support CDFIs, so community developmentfinancial institutions.It's a $180 million fund.We supported 60 organizations.And then, in turn, the CDFIs turn aroundand support small businesses, particularlyin diverse communities.So we helped over 130,000 small businesses.40% were women-owned small businesses.Over 50% were small businesses owned by diverse communities.So we're proud of that work.We thought CDFIs was the way to reach deeper into communitiesand fill the gap where banks or other capital providers weren'tproviding the right capital access.So that's one example.Another example around small business is entrepreneurs.So when you think about entrepreneurs,mostly companies get started by venture capital funding.But only 3% of venture capital funding in the USgoes to Black and Latino founders,yet we're almost a third of the population of the US.So 3% to a third, there's a huge gapin terms of how equitable or not capital is distributed whenit comes to venture capital.So we invested in funds that are looking to bridge this gap.And we also set up our own Black Founders Fundand Latino Founders Fund where we're directlyfunding companies.And then the last example I'll mentionis around digital skills.Five years ago, we started a programof Google Career Certificates, where,without a degree required, you could take between three to sixmonths online--you could take a course and earn a Google Career Certificatein fields like IT support or data analyticsor cybersecurity, not just for jobs in tech but jobs anywherewhere these skills are required and important.And what we found is, in particularfor underserved communities, whatgot in the way for learners to beable to complete these certs was life got in the way.So they needed more support, wraparound support,whether it's job placement support, a livingstipend, childcare support.A lot of our learners are parents,many have more than one job.So we set up a $100 million fund,which is the biggest-ever workforce developmentfund set up by any company.This is news.We don't have results to show yet for it.But we're very excited about whatit can do in terms of creating more opportunity moreequitably for communities.And we view economic opportunity as core to DEI.When you think about the March on Washington in 1963,it was actually called the Jobs and Freedom March.So jobs--MELANIE PARKER: Yeah, it just celebrated 60 yearson Saturday.JUAN RAJLIN: Right, right.So that's the kind of work that we've done.MELANIE PARKER: It's a lot to reallybe proud of and setting that intention and the impactthat we'll continue to see and realize that you talked about.Some of these things, we're stillwatching to see what the full impact is.john, based on what both you and Juan just shared, where do youthink DEI can go when you think about the shiftsthat you've seen in the recent past?JOHN A. POWELL: Well, I think there'sgoing to be a lot of turmoil for the next several years.As many of you know, there's a pushback.In some states now, you can't use the word \"equity.\"And there's a zero-sum sensibility,that if one group does well, another group does poorly.And it's become a political football.And I think all of us, but certainlylarge organizations like Google, will play a pivotal rolein helping us to potentially navigate this.And I think, from our perspective,the work around belonging can help in that regardbecause it's not belonging for some.We say, how do you create a world where everyone belongsand no one is othered?And most of our efforts around these issueshave been seen as zero-sum.So it's really important to do the workthat Juan just described.But it's also really important to tell a story,to have a narrative so people can see themselves,that when we say \"diversity\" and when we say \"belonging,\" we'renot saying whites are excluded.And that's the implicit assumptionthat some people make it explicit.'What are you doing for poor whites?'And in a sense, I think that's a legitimate question.But doing things for poor whites shouldn'tmean you're not doing anything for poor Blacksor poor Latinos or poor Asians.It's that everybody should have a place at the table.So I think we have to really refine that and makeit clear that when we talk about equity and diversityand when we talk about inclusion, when we talkabout belonging, we really are talking about everybody,but it also has some problematic teeth behind it,so we're not just talking.As the country becomes more diverse,and frankly as whites become less of a dominant number,it's going to be hard to figure out,how do we do this and share?How do we do it with everyone around the table?And there'll be some people who say, you know what,if we don't have any Blacks at this school, that's fine.They won't look at the structures and mechanisms.They won't look at all the things in place thathave been keeping people back.So I think that part of the questionwill be, can we really think of a worldwhere everyone but everyone belongs.We have fixed Thomas Jefferson's apparent statement, that, no,this is not just about men.This is not just about white people.This is not just about Black people.This is about everyone.And I think the role of Google and innovators--in a sense, this will be the most important innovation,the idea of a multiracial, multiethnic democracyis really an experiment.Can it really survive?If it doesn't survive, then all the other thingswe're doing really won't add up, if wedon't survive in terms of our core values and institutions.So we, for one, have been saying,we want to create a world where belonging is a global norm--where belonging is a global norm.Now, just think about 75 years ago,the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.Literally, when that declaration was made,people didn't know what it was about.There were arguments, it doesn't mean anything.People are starving.People need education.People need health care.Why are you talking about a declaration of human rights?And today, we haven't achieved it.But it has meaning.It has guff.It has a norm.Can we do the same thing with belonging?And if we do that, it will be because people like yourself,organizations like Google will be taking a leadership role,will be entrepreneurs in terms of makinga world where we all belong.MELANIE PARKER: That gives me so much hope,I don't know about all of you.But certainly inspirational and aspirational to lean into that.In recent years, belonging has becomeof greater importance and focus of the work we do at Google.Thank you so much for your partnership.And it's become increasingly so at other companies,where we're seeing some companies replacing \"inclusion\"with \"belonging\" in the DEI equation.And at Google, belonging isn't justabout making sure that people are included,but it's ensuring that they really belong,that they actually feel that they belongand that's what they're experiencing.And I'd love to hear from both of youabout, how do you think about belonging?And you started to share that a little bit, john.But if you could go a little bit deeper.And then, Juan-- or, Juan, let's start with you,and then go to john.JUAN RAJLIN: Yeah, so just to reflect a little bit on Google,so I've been at Google for five years.And at Google, one of the core principles that we haveis psychological safety with teams.So this is kind of a long-standing concept.But I think we did research a while back around,how do teams perform, and what teamsare most innovative or most productive,and trying to determine what were the characteristics whatthat were common in those teams that were most innovative.And the one thing that kept coming up again and againand again was psychological safety.So in other words, the team membersfelt that their team had their back,that they could make mistakes, and those mistakes weren'tgoing to be held against them, that it was OK to take risks.And there was a sense where you were safe.So first things first, psych safety for teams.I think the next thing I think we've learned,especially after 2020 and 2021, when we were literally apartfor two years, we physically couldn't be together,we also had quite a bit of community,I would say, at Google without realizing it,with the micro kitchens and the volleyball courts and allthese things we do so that Googlerscan spend time together.And we lost that overnight.So having a-- and it was a big challenge for leaders like us.How do we keep that going when wecan't be physically together?We also had a lot of people join that never got an opportunityto be in with their teams, physically together,and they were onboarding into an organization with a laptop,and that was it.So they had a very different experience.They didn't quite feel like they belonged.So between psych safety and community,I think that's the combination, at least what we strive for.I'm not saying we're there or perfect.But that's what we try to--that's how I think about how we create belonging,when you have both of those things.MELANIE PARKER: I appreciate how you drew that outand what both of you touched on.There's a real need to solve for groups that are situated apartfrom the majority.And you were talking about that, john, with othering.I think it really helps us to start takinga look at what othering means.And so could you talk a little bit more about othering?And what's the role of othering and belonging?JOHN A. POWELL: So as I said earlier about how,again, back in the '80s and '90s,we were talking about tolerance.And now I'm sure for most of you, at least for me,it's a funny word.Like, who wants to be tolerated, right?In a sense, you're saying these people areso different from us, we can tolerate them.I mean, how many of you go on a date and someonesays, it's a great date, I really couldtolerate another date with you?I don't think so.So othering is basically when youdon't see someone else's full humanity, whenyou don't see someone else's full dignity, whenyou see someone as lesser than.And it even goes beyond that.Sometimes we see not only people as lesser than,but we also see them as a threat.And it can be explicit, or it can be implicit.When we see another human being, naturethought it would be kind of cool to recognize each other.So when we see another human being,there's this part of the brain that lights up.It's on an unconscious level, just like, hey, fellow species.When we deeply other people, that part of the braindoes not light up.Instead, the part that does light upis the part associated with insects, with disease,with disgust.So when we deeply other someone, we actuallysee them not as a human being on an unconscious level.So belonging is acknowledging and practicingthat we are profoundly interconnected--profoundly interconnected.And belonging takes us beyond inclusion because inclusion--many of you have started new jobs and you're included.What does that mean?Well, you're a guest.And oftentimes when you start a new job, you're on probation.You're a guest.We're going to see if we like you.We're going to see if you're OK.And if we do, maybe you'll be asked to be part of the team.If not, we'll ask you to leave.You're on probation, not the company, not your boss.And it's like, this is the way we do things here.I compare it to going to someone else's dinnerparty or someone else's party, and they pick the food.They pick the music.They pick the other guests.You're welcome to come, but you're a guest.And as a guest, you can be asked to leave.So inclusion is more like being a guest.You're joining somebody's thing that youhad maybe no hand in making.I'll give you one concrete example.In the 1970s, when women came into the workplacein large numbers, many of the workplaceshad pornographic pictures lining the wall.And the women were saying, ugh.And the guys said, this is the way we do things.You're a rookie here.Don't come here making problems.We've done like this for 30, 40, 50 years.This is who we are.That case actually went all the way to the Supreme Court.And that's when the idea of a hostile work environmentcame out.But many of the men-- although some of the men objected, too--didn't see what was wrong with the environment.This is just the way we do things.So we're inviting women in, but come in and shut up.Inclusion is saying, come in and shut up.Belonging is saying, co-create.You're not joining something that's just there.You're contributing to something that's going to be next.We want every part of you.It doesn't mean you get to make it over all by yourself.But you get to co-create it with others.So the heart, the core of belongingis your full participation in your co-creation.And in that sense, it's inclusion 2.0.MELANIE PARKER: That's amazing.When you were talking about that,it made me think about this idea, this notion of bridging.And how do you bridge from othering to belonging?Like, what does that look like?JOHN A. POWELL: Well, bridging is a very important concept.So there are two concepts that really support belonging.One is bridging, and the other oneis called targeted universalism.And bridging, as the name suggests, is basically saying,we are different in some important wayeven though those differences may be entirely social.That is, there's no inherent difference.I'm probably taller than most of you, and that's irrelevant.We don't organize around, tall peopleare going to live on this street,the short people are going to live on that street.We do do that around, Jews are goingto live in this neighborhood, non-Jewsare going to live in this neighborhood.We do that around, Black people aregoing to live in this neighborhood,white people are going to live in-- so there'sdifferent types of othering.When we other not just at an individual levelbut at a group level, when we saythat if you want to come to this countryand you're from a Muslim country, you can't come,or when we say in East Africa, if you're gay,you're subject to execution, we'renot talking about individuals.We're talking about groups.So when we put groups at odd, we create a cleavage between them.We're saying, this group does not belong,or this group's difference is problematic.So bridging is saying, how do we see, how do we build a bridgeto that other group?There's a lot of stuff, and there'sa lot of stuff on our website.I'm literally writing a book now on bridging.But the beginning of it is to be willing to see the other personas a full human being and hear their story,really listen to their suffering.That word \"compassion,\" which is the heart of bridging,means to suffer with.So it doesn't mean, I agree with you.It doesn't mean necessarily I like you.But am I willing to really listen and see your humanity?And the research on this is actually phenomenal, that whenyou actually deeply listen--the South African word is [NON-ENGLISH],,which means \"I see you.\"\"I see you.\"And we need to be seen.And when we see each other, somethinghappens in both directions.So learning to create a space, stories,practices where we really see each other, that'sthe heart of bridging.And the power of that is hard to understate.One quick example.Nelson Mandela, when he was in prison,he asked the prison guards to teach himthe words of his captors, Afrikander.In Soweto, the students were protestingbecause they were having to learn instructionsin Afrikaans.It's like, we don't want to learn that language.Nelson Mandela was being imprisoned by the Afrikandersand saying, I want to see your sacred symbols.And so that movie when he comes out and goesto the rugby match, he's again, it's like, I see you.And it's controversial.And most of us aren't Nelson Mandela.But can we actually pause and see each other?Can we actually pause and be curious about each other?Because the other thing, when you other someone,you're not curious about them.They become flat.They become just the old Black man or justa gay man or just a Latino or just a woman.And none of us are any of those justs.We're multiple beings.And so bridging requires a curiosity and a willingnessto really see each other.MELANIE PARKER: You know, john, there's a real needto solve for groups that are situated apartfrom the majority.And I think that's what you're taking us deeper into.And by doing that, it helps us to starttaking a look into the future.We're able to use what we've learned,we're able to use data, research,and the common humanity that you talked about to really buildthis path forward.So as we think more about the future of DEI,something that's really excited me about this framework,and you've really been giving us these concepts along the way,is the framework called targeted universalism, whichis that idea of looking at universal goals thatare common to humanity versus a specific group.And so can you dive into this a little bit deeper?JOHN A. POWELL: Yes, thanks for the question.So if you think about equity, the wayit's practiced in most places, itsays there's a favorite group that has a lot or has too much.And there's a marginal group.And the goal is to close the disparity between those groups.So the baseline is what the favorite group has.And the goal then is to close the gap between the groups.And that seems reasonable until you dig into it more deeply.What if what the favorite group has is not all that good?Think about suicide.The suicide rate between Black men and white menhave been declining, not because Black men arekilling themselves less often but because white men arekilling themselves more often.So should we be happy if we kill ourselvesat the same rate as white men?So what is the goal?If the goal is not to have what white people have,what is the goal?Also, when you say let's close the gap,it creates a zero-sum competition.We say, let's take from one groupand give to the other group.Well, if you're the group that's being taken from,you don't feel good about yourself.And the group who feels like they should have more,they feel like they should have more.So again, this is what we're dealing with right now.So what does targeted universalism do with that?It says, the goal is universal.It's not tied to any particular group.We can say all groups should flourish.And then we say, but groups are situated differently.So how do we get groups who are situated differentlyto that universal goal?It's targeted strategy.The strategies are targeted based on how we're situated.Concrete example.Let's say we want to get from the second floorto the third floor.We're going to build an escalator.The goal is clear.We're going to go from floor 2 to floor 3.Here comes someone in a wheelchair.We can now, a simple concept of equality,say, let's treat everybody the same.I'm ambulatory.I get on the escalator.This person has to figure out how to get on an escalator,too.Well, this doesn't seem quite right.We could say, we need an elevator for this person.Then some people will say, this personis getting special treatment.Why does she get an elevator?The treatment is not special.The treatment is targeted based on how we are situated.And so targeted universalism sayswe want to get everybody, including the white men,we want to get everybody to stop killing themselves,every group, including white men, including white women,including Black men, including Black women--everybody.But we are situated differently.So we're not going to treat everybody the same.We're going to treat people consistent with howthey're situated to get them to that universal.So that's targeted universalism.And we also refer to it sometimes as equity 2.0because we think it's what equity was trying to get to,but it got lost in terms of this fight between whatwas considered a dominant group and a marginal group.MELANIE PARKER: Juan, as you think about this conceptand you think about the larger \"we\" and approaching DEIfrom this lens and this framework, whatare some of the ways that you've seen this broughtinto practice at Google?And what do you think is important about howit's factored over the next five-plus years?JUAN RAJLIN: Yeah, so this is very much in line with the workwe need to do at Google because just think about Google.We have 15 products that have over half a billion users each.We have six products that have two billion users each.So when you think about the universe, that'swho we're solving for, right?And our mission is to organize the world's informationand make it universally accessible and useful,universally.So it's in our mission actually.And we've been on a journey, I would say, for the last fiveyears to embed this thinking of actually thinkingabout every user, which means you have to thinkabout it differently because--like you just explained it so brilliantly.You actually put in a bottle what we try and dowith our products to make them useful for everyone.Now, it's a journey.I wouldn't say we're perfect at this.But products like the skin tone on the Pixel camera,which captures different skin tones with accuracy,whereas, before, the camera didn't capture all skintones with the same accuracy.You can do the math on which skin tones were notproperly captured.[CHUCKLES]Or having the ability on Search or on Maps or on Shoppingto identify communities, create opportunity,like Black-owned businesses or LGBT-friendlyand safe businesses and places.Sometimes it's about safety for some of our communities.Or this is my favorite example--it's also Cloud product--on Meet, you now have live captions.So if you have a hearing disability,we can literally level the playing field,and you could operate as if you didn't have itbecause we have that.Just the power of our products and the power of technologythat we collectively in this room--the impact we can have if we think about thisand embed it into how we think about the productsfrom the design stage all the way through.So I view it as a big opportunityactually, what you just articulated.MELANIE PARKER: Definitely.I mean, this has been such an incredible conversation.I know if I'd been in the audience,I would have been taking feverish notes.And so as we really end our time together,I want to close by asking each of youto share, what are some key practices, tips, actionsthat our audience can take with them backto their businesses, their institutions, their homes,as well as their communities to really help drivetowards this idea of DEI 2.0?And, Juan, let's start with you?JUAN RAJLIN: So I'm going to borrow from a Google colleague,given that this is an audience of mostly engineersand thinking about what we just talked about,about thinking about everyone for whenyou build your products.And she-- this is Ann Baptiste, who leads our product inclusionwork at Google.She loves to say, if you don't intentionally include,you will unintentionally exclude,meaning you may have the best intentionsand think that you are building for everyone,but unless you start at the very beginningand have the different points of view and voicesat the very beginning of the design process,you're actually excluding.You're actually othering, like what john said.And so that's one takeaway for engineers in particularas you build products to be intentional about including.MELANIE PARKER: Thank you.john, what's something you'd liketo leave the audience with?JOHN A. POWELL: Well, a couple of things very quickly.\"We hold these truths to be self-evidentthat all people are created equal.\"So why aren't they equal?If we're created equal, why aren't they?One way of reading what the Declaration of Independence,which really is borrowing from Aristotle,is that when you cease statistical enduringinequality, it's to suggest probablythat something's wrong.If we believe that people are inherently equal,than consistently having women not in the workplaceshouldn't be, well, they have to explain that theydeserve to be in the workplace.It's like, maybe there's something going on.If we start with the assumption that everybody is capable--every group, not just individuals, every group--and then tell a story and make surethat many of those people in groups get data,and then also talk to those groups thatare excluded to build a world where everyone but everyonebelongs.MELANIE PARKER: Thank you both for sharing those.At Google, we want belonging to be felt everywhere,in our workplace, in our products, in our society.And we want this to be felt by everyone.But we recognize that it's a marathon.It's not a sprint.And it means that we're not only tryingto solve the problems of today, but we'retrying to build a better foundation sothat we don't have to keep solvingthe same problems tomorrow.You can visit belonging.google.comto see the ways that we foster belonging for everyoneacross these areas.As I said before, I am incrediblyhopeful that the work that we've done and will continue to dowill spark ideas on how you can impactyour businesses, your institutions, your homes,as well as your communities.It's truly been an incredible conversationwith so much information for our audience to take with them.I've thoroughly enjoyed speaking with both of you.And I want to thank you for joining us today.JOHN A. POWELL: Thank you.JUAN RAJLIN: Yeah.[APPLAUSE]MELANIE PARKER: So thanks to all of youwho have joined us here today.Please be sure to check out this session on the Next websiteafter the event.We're going to post a recording of this session.We're going to include some downloadable resources for youto use on your own journey going forward.Thanks for being here.Enjoy the rest of your time at Next.[MUSIC PLAYING]"
