    "transcript": "foreign[Music]welcome here to the session onaccelerating Innovation for your sapworkloads on Google CloudI think folks are still rolling in butwe'll get startedmy name isI lead product management alongside mycolleagues Mike and sherwick here in theaudience here we'll be running thesession and as you can tell we have apacked session with a lot of speakers infact we're very excited about three ofour customers joining here on stagetalking to you guys about how they areaccelerating their digitaltransformation on the platformnow from a ghoul's perspective what wehope to accomplish in this session is sowe'll be discussing why customers arechoosing Google Cloud for their sapworkloads we'll talk a little bit aboutour capabilities we'll talk about somenew exciting announcements we're goingto make here todaywe're also going to hear of course fromthe three Spotlight customers we'regoing to hear from VodafoneI don't think they need an introductionthey're the largest Telecom in the worldwe're going to hear from Indigo Booksthey are the largest book and musicretailer in Canada we're going to hearfrom Mercado Libre who are also thelargest e-commerce they have the largeste-commerce ecosystem in Latin right allof these customers have very interestingstories to share with you about whatthey have done in terms of acceleratingtheir Journey when it comes to sapworkloads on Google cloud and we're ableto get a lot of good business outcomesfrom the from the move to Google Cloudand time permitting we'll do some q a atthe endso first I want to take a moment andacknowledge and recognize celebratethousands of customers who are actuallywho brought their sap workloads to theplatform in our Digi and our undergoingreal digital transformationall of these customers you know theycome from different verticals Financeretail they come from differentgeographies all over the worldbut one thing that's you know uniqueacross and rather common across all ofthese folks is thebusiness outcomes they're able to driveby bringing their workloads onto theplatform just as examples we have ATBFinancial who's able to improve the timefrom data to insights by 117 times afterthey move their Erp systems into theGoogle cloud in the and after leveragingbigquery on the platformwe have a company called One NetworkExpress it's a singapore-based shippingcompanyit used to take them a full day to getdata into their on-premises datawarehouse now it takes them minutes tobasically load that same data intobigquery and get to insights we havecompanies like Home Depot we havecompanies like Southwire here who areone of the biggest manufacturers ofcable here in the United States it usedto take them weeks if not months to getinfrastructure simply for sap upgradeprojects it takes them literally minutesto accomplish the same thing now inGoogle Cloudand you'll hear more from our customerson their Amazing Stories and whatthey've been able to accomplish onGoogle cloud in a little bitnow one of the things we are very proudof here in Google cloud is ourlong-standing partnership with septhat that goes back many many years oftight collaboration between both theteams at an engineering level productlevel and suchsap actually deploys and develops theirapplications on Google cloud in fact anumber of sap applications like Aribasuccess factors Etc run on Google Cloudtoday and the advantage of all of thatis that you get a top-notch experiencefor your applications as you bring themon to Google Cloud we in fact have tightcollaboration between both theengineering teams the influence ourroadmap and vice versa between both theteamsMike here in a little bit will talkabout the comprehensive certificationswe have on the platformand no matter what modernization pathsby the way you may choose for your sapJourney on the platform whether it's saprise whether you're doing uh clean CoreInnovations with s4hana on top of ACPbtp all of these are very well supportedon the platform thanks to thecollaboration between the teams but hereat Google cloud and sapof course earlier this year we announcedthe partnership between sap data spherebigquery and vertex AI highly encourageyou to attend those sessions we won't becovering that here I just wanted to givea big shout out to that partnership aswellnow the benefit of all of this is thatU.S customers get to you know enjoy aplatform that is Battle tested by sapfor sap workloadslet me take a second to tee up whycustomers are choosing Google Cloud foryou know the digital transformation forsap applicationsfirst and foremost it's about theperformance and reliabilityyou know the fact of the matter is thethe The Innovation that you're going todo on the sap application is very highlytightly correlated with the performanceand the reliability of the underlyinginfrastructure and that's what we oftenhear from customersMike in a bit we'll talk about thespecial capabilities that we have on theplatform that lets you run yourapplicationsperform uh perform in a way that isindustry leading and your uptime thatyou get from the platform is alsoindustry leading number two is securitywe often hear from customers thatthey're bringing their sap applicationsand they get much better levels ofsecurity on Google platform than theywere able to get before I think if youguys tune in to the keynote this morningyou heard a lot of good stats on howGoogle Cloud sets you know is sittingapart from the rest of the hyperscalerswhen it comes to the number of threatvectors we see the amount ofvulnerabilities we see on the platformEtc all of that you get to takeadvantage of as you bring your sapapplications and run them securely onthe platformLots but last but not the least is it isa launch pad for Innovation as you bringyour sap workloads onto the platform weknow that you have a lot of businessdata in those applications by easilyextending their that data and takingadvantage of data analytics EI serviceson the platform we've seen a lot ofcustomers be able to innovate much muchfaster on top of Google cloud and we'lldefinitely hear that from our customershere as well with that let me hand thisover to Mike we'll talk a little bitabout the infrastructure capabilities onthe platform rightthank you venkatum as venkat mentioned we've spent a lotof time making sure that you can runyour sapapplications on Google Cloud so what wespend most of our time is making sure wehave that solid foundation we have over150 certifications actually it'sapproaching 200 certifications thatcover sap netweaver sap Hana businessone and also running other sapapplications like ASE business objectson Google Cloud so we've spent a lot oftimes working with Sap's engineering andcertification team to ensure that youhave that reverse infrastructure toscale we have 38 regions that you candeploy Google your sap deployments onGoogle cloud in fact we're very proud tosay that every time we launch a newregion like we did last week with ournew Paris our New Berlin region I shouldsay is that it's available day one torun your sap workloads so it's somethingthat we've been working heavily onso what do we actually deliver wesupport running from their smallersystems which you can see here on theleft side is our N2 family and then onefamily so this is really our smallerdeployments for really up to about oneterabyte of memory we certify for oltpso this slide is representing the oltpworkloads that you run for Hanawe also have our memory optimizedvirtual machines which are m1s m2s andM3 systems so you can scale from fourfrom one terabyte up to 12 terabytesand we also have uh solutions for thosecustomers that need to go beyond 12terabytes which is our 18 and 24terabytes in fact Micarta Libre willtalk later I want to congratulate themon their go live of 24 terabytes asecond 24 terabyte go live this lastweekend so that went smoothlywhen we certified the 24 terabytes weworked heavily to make sure that wedeliver the most saps that you can doand obviously if you know saps they'rehow you size your your benchmark of yoursystem your s4hana so it's memory andsaps and with892 case apps we actually set a industryworld record for Intel that we stillmaintain we also are able to supportstorage and this is something that's nottoday up to 7.2 gigabytes per secondwith Hyper this extremeso this basically means you can bringyour workloads and grow on Google Cloudnow obviously this is scale up we havealso the need for sometimes to go toscale out so scale out for your S4 Hondasystems or your olap use cases so thisgraph we're showing here is that we canscale from one terabyte olap withmultiple nodes together so to 16terabytesall the way up to 192 terabytes which issomething we co-innovated with sap onthe first customer you see here which isPayPal so this is very much specific toan s4hana use case that's a combinedolap and oltp use case and this is wherethey're live currently with 8 times 12terabyte nodesin addition we worked with sap rise withsapto have their first scale out customergo live on Google Cloud which isMahindra and Mahindrawhich was basically moving from theiron-premise system and they were movingit and they needed more CPU than our 12terabyte system so they actually scaledto run on multiple ones of our memoryoptimized VMSand then finally alphabetGoogle's parent runs alsosap and also in a couple of weeks agowent live on scale outso we also if you say eat our own dogfood drink our own champagne we actuallybuild Solutions they're our customerzero and we work heavily with that teamto bring the Innovations we work withthem to you the customerso we spend a lot of time making surethat we have the right Mission criticalabilities that you know we get ourpayroll as employees make sure so wemake sure those systems run and scale wealsosorrywe also have a number of announcementsthat we wish to go through today sothese ones were some of them werementioned the keynote some of them werementioned in other sessions here we werethe first we announced last week Ishould say a couple weeks ago the C3Intel Sapphire rapid space so this isthe fourth generation Intel uh CPU andwe're the first Cloud to certify sapHana and netweaver to run on itso this is really built for the very CPUintensive workloads you have for yourcombined oltp old app use cases we'realso announcing here at the event thelatest generation of of our AMDprocessor based servers and this is thec3d based on the fourth generation AMDplatform in addition storage as I kindof alluded to we are announcing a newtype of storage called hyperdiscbalanced which will be a successor for alot of our sap use cases for PD balancedand PD SSD which is our our low andmedium offering for our block storagesolution in addition hyperdisc extremewhich already was the fastest Cloudsolution native Cloud solution availableat five gigabytes per second we're nowalso releasing that this will beavailable at 7.2 gigabytes per secondand that's really critical for customersto have large SAP systems that need toload data into memory very fast likemaintenance windows or if you have aHana restart where you're not able toreload data from memory you have to loadit back from disk so something we'reworking heavily on these very largesystemsandand as I mentioned we also have 38regions and 12 more planned in the nextcouple of yearsmoving on um we are also announcingsomething which I think is very criticalto our sap customers has then catmentioned its Mission criticalapplications its reliability we'veworked for a number of years onimproving the reliability introducingthings like memory poison recoverybecause you know we have a lot of dimsin these large memory servers and how dowe actually successfully ensure that ifthere's a dim failure application doesnot crash with all that work we didwe're actually introducing a new SLAwe're going from 995 to 9995 for ourlarge in memory servers so this is agreat significant leap over what we seethe competition and our if you want tosay areour work on engineering and reliabilityand being able to provide that is ahigher SLA for you we're also increasingall the smaller ones so if you sawbefore that's the M on the prior sidethe m1s m2s M3s we'll all go to 395 andin addition those n2s that you sawbefore and all the other ones you run onapplication servers all the AMD we'realso increasing that from 995 to 999. sothis is the confidence that we have inour delivery of mission criticalinfrastructure for your applicationsand then in addition we also are workinga lot on the tooling for you to deployyour SAP systems so we have a lot ofterraform templates you can useterraform and ansible to actuallyautomate the deployments of yourinfrastructure what we've done is alsodeliver this guided UI that you canautomatically configure all of theseterraform scripts you can also not justdeploy the storage and theinfrastructure you can deploy theoperating system and you can alsoprovide the installation files for sapHana or your or your application serversit will install this as well and alsowe'll configure ha for you based on ourbest practices so that's something thatwe spend a lot of time to reallyaccelerate your deployments and makingsure that you deploy it based on bestpractices and from our knowledge andalso what we've learned with runningsystems with sap and Alpha for alphabetokay I've talked a lot here so I'd liketo say let's have a customer talk so I'dlike to introduce Willie to come onstage our CIO or Vodafone so we'll leaveyou join us on stage and share yourjourneyforeign[Music]thank you[Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]excellent that video was to wake upafter lunchtime so I hope it was it wasnice thank you very much for theopportunity really appreciateum I've got a great story to tell todayI only have six minutes so it's gonna befairly brief happy to take questionsafterwardsum as you can see Vodafone is a largeneed to accompany talker we serve 300million customers across 24 markets andwe're on sap shop I mean otherwise Iwouldn't be standing here right so we'vewe've been a customer of sap for manyyears about 12 years or so and as youcan see we run our finance our ACM ourHR systems largely off this platform andthe story is about our journey over thelast couple of years we've we've alsotaken up a number of the sap softwaresand service offerings like Reba concursuccess factors that runs across ourwhole Enterpriseum looking back and by the way our Erpsystem is called evos if I refer to Evothat's our Erp system we um we build upa very substant substantial Erpcapability servicing uh 125 000 desktopusers also increasingly mobile at thatstage 31 000 56 million assets and youcan see one single Erp solution acrossall 24 markets so that was at that timeI think a fairly aggressive decision totake but in hindsight a very gooddecision for for Vodafone it allows usto obviously run consistent processes interms of global policies you know HumanResources we also run centrally fromthat point of view so a very verypowerful capabilityever despite the fact that we'd upgradedfairly early to to s4hana and sort of ofthe associated benefits there was nodoubt that the organization telcos beingvery very Dynamic lots of mergers andAcquisitions that we had to think aboutbusiness agility how do we move fasterhow do we actually sell and buycompanies and put them onto thisplatform much much faster also volumesas you can imagine increasing volumes inthe platform need to keep up withtechnology changes and then increasinglywe saw workarounds as wellat this stage completely on-premplatform so one could say if you look atthat slide clearly Cloud's answer wealso built up a very good strategicrelationship with Google so it was avery sensible decision for us toactually go to the next stepwe got a little bit of a help from theour chief technology officer and he gaveus a challenge to say if we can moveeither to the cloud without any businessdisruption we could literally move anyanything to the cloud and that's exactlywhat we did we took up the challengeabout two years ago and we started theplanning associated with this veryambitious programthree very important phrases and thefirst phase that I'm talking about nowyou could argue is the mechanistic pieceand that was to move the workloads fromour on-prem infrastructure and tomodernize that onto onto gcpthe very more important and moresignificant next steps would be toleverage our strategic partnership withGoogle we've built with Google a verysubstantiveVodafone data ocean across theEnterprise and clearly that gives us anopportunity to move to the third phasearound cross-enterprise insights andautomationand and also the associated Innovationthat's so so critical for for Vodafoneso our Focus up till now has been onphase one we're now going into phase twoand then phase three with everythingthat we heard today as well and what'sbeen spoken about we think ourpositioning is really really excellentso let's talk about the programum I think all of you have seen thisbefore as you can imagine it was aphased program we didn't do all of thethe big complex stuff first in fact weleft that for for lost so you can see wewe had an initial Sprint to do the basicsetup make sure we got the teams inplace we were very lucky and I'll talkabout it later as well is that we havevery very deep technical expertise thatwe bought over many years and thathelped us immensely to de-risk this thisjourney so our first wave zero was sortof our tone the water if you want fromthat point of view so it was relativelysmall number of workloads also not thatrisky by the time we got to wave threewhich was not long ago about two monthsago that's when we really did our verycomplex work which is our 700 interfacesinto all of our markets Legacy back-endsystems and so clearly that we had tomanage that very very carefully by thetime we got to wave three the machinewas well oiled and we could actuallyreally execute this with zero businessimpact and it sounds like a marketingheadline but I can truly say I didn'tget one escalation from anybody infinance or HR or even sem in fact thestatement that I got from the head ofACM in Luxembourg he says well he didn'teven know that we were doing this weshould have told them but just shows youit was completely seamless from an enduser point of viewsome of the benefits so clearly at theend of the day it's all about benefitsthe good news is we are definitelysaying our business case assumptionsbeing met in practice also you see theresiliency around the availabilitysustainability we're super excited aboutwhat we can do there we're going todecommission in the next two months morethan 400 services in our on-premenvironment which which we we feel isabsolutely doable also Innovation moreresponsive I did say that that is one ofour challenges and then the importantone is customer satisfaction and revenueso you can see theless than five days in terms of monthenclosure for our financial director andour CEO that's a really really criticalmeasure and we can do that consistentlynow across 24 markets to get the thefinal numbers out which I think is veryimportantso some of our key success factors andlearnings I think comparisons experienceand skills really helped us immenselyboth from a business point of view lotsof continuity around Finance HR ECMinvolvement over many years sometechnically value management a goodsensible business case that underpinseverything that we do then the solartechnical Foundation S4 so I think thatwas a very good intermediate step for usbefore going into into gcp and thenstrong partnership and sponsorship atall levels I have to call out that we Ibelieve at a very good partnershipbetween sap Accenture our SI partnerum as as well as Googleand supported by strong very strongexecutive sponsorship I think that's apoint of continuity over the last 12years our FD Margarita Del Vos is not agroup CEO I think helped us immensely toshow us the true north and be consistentso I think if you put all those factorsTogether We were put in a position wherewe could live up to the expectation thatour and challenge that our CTO gave usand I'm very happy to say a program wellexecuted and we're now ready to go tothe next phases of of reallyexploitation thank you very muchforeignand educational at the same timeI'll talk a little bit about you knowhow earlier I mentioned right one of thereasons that customers use the platformor choose our platform is for securitylet me kind of like tee that up a littlebit before inviting Daniel on stagewhere he'll share a story about how theyare able to securely run theirapplications on top of Google Cloudnow when it comes to security that's avery very important mission for us and Ithink of security in two layers one isit the foundation things that you guysautomatically benefit from from what weare doing on the platform the fact thatyou know we have the world's largestprivate Network basically means thatyour data spends less time exposed tothreat vectors that come from you knowyour data being exposed on the internetthe fact that there's end-to-endencryption by default on Google Cloudall these are foundational things thatyou automatically benefit from the youknow the platform being very very secureon top of that there are a number ofservices and capabilities that we exposeto you to run your applications muchmore securely on the platform one suchexample is a security Command Centerwhich lets you continuously monitor yoursap applications on the platformthe other one in highly differentiatedis assured workloads chances are thatyour admission critical businessapplications uh that rely on ACP stackare in some sort of like you know you'rein a regulatory environment or maybe youhave data residency requirements thatyou have to comply with assuredworkloads is a product that lets you doprecisely that without actually havingto select what I would call govcloudversion of of the cloudyou can use the same Google Cloud regionas you would for your non-compliantworkloads and put those applicationsfrankly under the same account just indifferent folders and all of theprojects in a folder that is tagged witha certain assured workload governanceset of controls get compliance and ofcourse the other ones in that accountyou know that are not tagged that wayyou don't you know they don't get thatgovernance so you can really mix andmatch your workloads those that requirecompliance and those that don't requirecompliance and this makes yourmanagement of these workloads much moreeasy and reduces your overall TCOas a side benefit even if you were tochoose assured workloads for yourcompliance needs the sap certificationsthat Mike mentioned earlier all of theinfrastructure that you choose naturallycarry those certifications and you getsupport from sap and Google for your sapapplications on on that fronttoday we got 12 plus compliance sort ofgovernance controls all the way from youknow if you're in the U.S fedramp is abig one uh both uh moderate and highitar and across the world this shows youa map of you know the 12 plus complianceprograms we have and we're alwaysexpanding that so if this is of interestyou know please do talk to us and we canof course you know we always are addingmore and more uh sort of regimes andgovernance controls to this serviceso I'm also going to announce a coupleof new things we are very excited tolaunch here at next the first one isworkload manager SCP security bestpracticesso if you've used workload managerproduct already what it does is it letsyou scan your sap applicationenvironment and checks against bestpractices that both Google and ACPArchitects have put together in how tobest run these applications in areliable fashion what we're doing rightnow is to addsecurity best practices to that list soin this first iteration we have you knowcontrols for better password managementAccess Control you know we check againstcritical vulnerabilities for your sapapplications and all of these things youget to make sure that your sapapplications are running much moresecurely on the platform highlyencourage you to take that sort ofpreview service for a Sprintthe next thing we're announcing is thenext Generation firewall that'spreviewing today so this is actuallygoing to be talked in depth in anetworking session so if this is ofInterest highly recommend attending thatsession and to get it uh download on onwhat that service can do it's a fullydistributed uh globally available uhservice powered underneath by the likesof Palo Alto Technologies and there's alot of AI and ml capabilities built intoit so it detects a lot of threats andprotects your applications with thefirewallall right so enough of me talking aboutsecurity I want to now invite Danielonto the stage and how they are takingbenefit of the platform to secure theirapplications Danielokay umhi everyone so basically uh before justgoing into the detail of security I justwant to put you into the context of ourenvironment so basicallyIndigo what's indigo indigo is actuallya um I would say comparable for thepeople in the states it's comparable toBarnes and Noble but we operate inCanadaumso it's a basically indigo is a 1.1billion dollar company keep in mind thatit's a Canadian dollars so lower downthe numbers a littleum and uh basically we have fewenvironments from an sap point of viewwe have em ewm ECC BW SCM pi and uh andthe Gateway so basically uh this is ourenvironment we have uh we have whetherwe have a Sandbox a QA environment aproduction environment developmentenvironment so we're roughly talkingabout 65 serversand I just wanted to for everyone tofully understand what is it that we havewe're dealing with here uh before we dotalk about the event that uh it Indigoon February 8th uh it was four o'clockin the morning I remember very wellum as you can imagine we went through ahuge cyber breachum I've just listed few of the theelements in there you'll see that welost over more than 930000 files it was a double exfiltrationtype of attack ransomware so not onlydid they took the threat actors to ourdata they also encrypted everything anddestroyed every single platform thatlooked like a storage unitso you can imagine the damageso even in our case we have we are wehave both we have Google and uh andAzure so gcp and Azure and in our casethey actually went in Azure and they hadplenty of fun I have to say uh they openup our vault uh they actually took allour all our data basically all ourprivilege information and let's keep inmind that they were in the systems as ofJanuary 16th so about 24 days where theyhad the chance to find out exactly ourenvironment what is it that needs to beattacked from which angle but the mainreason why I wanted to talk to you aboutall this is becauseumthere's also some positive about it thefirst one is first I'm here to talk toyou about this I haven't been let gowhich is usually the case for a Caesaror a ctioum but there's few other nice storiesand the first one is where are the 930000 files so let me just explain whenthey took the data what they did is thatthey created a Google bucket which makesperfect sense as we're Google customersso we add the chance at Indigo to beable to reach out to our partners atGoogle that was amazing this is the wayactually we talked to Google CanadaGoogle Canada talked to Google usthe idea was to put a legal old on thesebuckets so that the threat actorswouldn't be able to recuperate thosedata and they actually involved the FBIand with all these people around thetable we managed to put a legal old andup to today the data is still notavailable on the dark web which is whichis a really a key factor that helped usat indigothe other point that I wanted to talk toyou about is how many systems in gcp gotcompromisedcrazy enough the answer is noneso we have roughly 1200 servers atIndigo and 900 about 900 of them gotcompromised none of them got incompromising to the from the Googleenvironment and the main reason and Ihave to to really give a nice Kudo toboth Google and Axia we at Indigo didnot have any experience on this platformso we relied on our partners to buildthat Landing Zone to secure it andactually it paid off again going backthey knew so the threat actors were inthe system as of January 16th and theystill did not manage within three weeksto be able to get into the Googleenvironment so this is just to reinforcewhat we've heard this morning in theKeynotes that the Google environment isa secure environmentum and the last one that I wanted alsoto mention is the fact thatwe were completely downwe we actually were down for about 28days with noe-commerce website we our stores wereimpacted so many different systems sothe the reaction or my reflex in thiscase was really to reach out to bothAxia and Google Axia being our ourpartner uh and basically the idea was tosay since everything is down why don'twe move toum to this new production environmentthe due date or the plan date was to golive at mids at mid-march and actuallybecause of the help of everybody aroundthe table we actually were able to go togo live early March which is basicallysomething that you cannot even imaginegoing live while you're in the middle ofa crisisum and we we actually succeeded with thehelp of our partners so that's reallysomething that we've learned a lot fromand if by any chance I understand thatwe don't have much time to talk aboutbut if you want to discuss about any ofthe things about the the breach itselfor the partnership that uh that we wentthrough with Google and Axia I'll bemore than happy to discuss it aboutafter the sessionthank youthank you Daniel's story I'm surethere's a lot to be learned and pleasefeel free to reach out to Daniel afterthe session uh if you have any questionsso we're on to the final sort of thirdpillar that we talked about earlier thata lot of customers are bringing theirapplications onto the platform toinnovate right the thing aboutInnovation is um it's really aboutaccelerating insights you know from datain order to make much faster businessyou know decisions that's really at theheart of any Innovation on the platformwhat we have done uh is to make surethat you get to very easily takeadvantage of the other Google servicesso you can marry your sap applicationsand systems with the rest of the Googleservices so you can you know DriveInnovation with your Landscapes one ofthe ways we've done that is to make surethat we have things like BQ connectorwhich easily lets you take advantage ofbigquery alongside with your sap dataanother thing we've done is we have sapcortex which is really a collection ofdata models these are all pre-built datamodels where you can leverage the datathat you have in your SAP systems anddrive much faster insights we alsorecently launched above SDK so if youhave developers in your organizationswho are you know familiar with above youcan take advantage of that and easilybuild against your you know the rest ofthe Google servicesjust to kind of like put things inperspective so we talked about you knowa number of differentiators andcapabilities on infrastructure side alot of that basically helps you to getyour applications up and running to cutdown the time for sap upgrades Etc onthe platformyou can do that obviously but on top ofthat we have a vast array of you knowcross alphabet Services Google servicesthat you can take advantage of in orderto drive that Innovation that you wantand all of that put together is whatreally drives the ultimate businessoutcomes you heard a number of greatstats from both the speakers you knowcustomers so far in the ability to kindof like Drive their digitaltransformation and business outcomesI'm very pleased to invite onto stagenow Mercado Libre we're going to talkabout their story of modernization andInnovation and what they were able toaccomplish with Google CloudPablo indigothank you venkathi everyonefor those of you coming from LatinAmerica I'm pretty sure you already knowwhat Mercado Libre is but for the restof youMarco libre's mission is togive access to Commerce and financialservices to transform the life ofmillions of people in Latin Americatoday I want to share some figures withyou so you can better understand one whydata volume is our biggest concernduring the the first quarter we haveprovide services to more than 50 millionpeople in in the Commerce side and morethan 60 million people on this on thefinancial servicesall these transaction more than400 transactions per second and that'ssomehow on our sap system so now Diegowill explain how our subsystem handlethis data volume and how Google ishelping us going through thischallenging endeavorthank youhi everyoneI'm the technical manager for financialsystems and today I'm going to tell youaboutour sap architecture on Google Cloudour ecosystem is made up of two Erpsystemsour all ECCrunning on barometer solution with 24terabyteand our new S4 system running a memoryoptimized compute with 12 terabytes ofmemoryare interconnected with the rest of theSipon-premely solutionand all systems were Army ratedfrom Azure in five months with adowntime less than 50 minutesas you can see we use two reasons inNorwegian we we have our productionsystems running on running on highavailabilityand in Center one we have our disasterrecoveries sitewe use Hana system replication4C to sync both regionsand astorage solution to move the archivedatato maintain only three years of thesystemsin terms of advantages the optimizedcomputeNetwork latency thattwo lowers better than other providersand othersTechnologies advantages were veryimportant before to make the decision tomigrate on Google Cloudum to finishfor usthe partnership with Google is veryimportantto continueto continueworking in new technologies inInnovation to support our hyper roleso nowPablo continued with the strategyAnalyticsso one of the things we have realized byoperating thiskind of data volume is that whenwhen the user performed the Apparentlysmaller task on the on the sap side theycan easily jeopardize our entire systemso part of our strategy was to move thedata out from sap into our Radix systemdata lake house and in for doing that weare using SLT plus the Google bigqueryconnector so by doing thiswe can import the data into our datalake house that precise on bigquery andeasily get from there both operationalanalytics and andtraditional analytics and as you can seewe are moving now close to 26 billionrecords a monthso once the data is already there in sapwe have to plug the data into an saplike table and by doing this ourtechnical teams are allowed to performall kind of controls over the datain sap because we are replicating nearreal time after that we also are usingthe Google cortex framework as anaccelerator so we can easily transformthese sap tables into a businessknowledge and by doing that we close thegap between the the business user andthe business and the business terms sothey don't need to understand thecomplexity of the technical relationshipbetween the uh besides the sap datatables modelby aby performing all of these we haveminimized the the extra the onboardingof the new tables from a few days at thebeginning to only a couple of hours sonow even the the onboarding is muchfaster the the getting the Insight fromthe data it's much faster and of coursethat add a lot of value to to thecustomer along with the other dataalready including our data lake housethank you[Applause]"
