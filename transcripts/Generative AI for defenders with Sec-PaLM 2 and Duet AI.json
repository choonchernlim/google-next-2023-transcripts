getsituated and I'm erikter I lead thesecurity operations engineering atGoogle cloud and all of the platformwork we're doing around security Ai andI have a little later in the sessionwith me Jada Paul who's the CSO havedone in Bradstreet who's going to talk alittle bit about their Journey as wellas Rex dexton who uh leads everythinginteresting at Accenture related tosecurity and is going to come on stageand talk a little bit about theirexperience but I want to kind of JumpRight In and oh I should also say myapologies for the profile picture Iwanted to have a serious securitypicture because I'm a serious securityindividual and then someone told me thatit makes me look like I'm a Hitman andso uh but it was we couldn't change theslides blah blah blah so you know herewe are uh but we're really here to talkabout about Ai and I don't know ifyou've noticed but at Google next we'rea little bit excited about generative AIuh but but I do want to kind of take astep back and say look as excited as weare about the possibilities thatgenerative AI is unlocking across allthe fields of Technologyum it's still a tool and the tool has tosolve real problems it's not interestingto think about tools just for Tool'ssake or Tech just for text sake and andwe've framed kind of talking to manycustomers many of you we think there arethree big problems in Security today anduh we had to be alliterative so threatsToil and talent are the three andobviously uh many of you deal with theseevery day you read them out them in thenews every day the increasing hostilityof the threat landscape the growth ofthe attack surface uh you know thereality is we hire Amazing SecurityExperts and have them work on our teamand many of them tell us that they lovethe mission of security of protectingtheir organization protecting the planetand kind of hate their job becausethere's a lot of toil there's a lot ofthings that just kind of suck andshouldn't take a human but do take ahuman today and then the third of courseis the well-publicized talent Gapdepending on who you believe hundreds ofthousands maybe even millions of openjobs that we just can't fill withtrained people in cyber security andwe're quite excited about how generativeAI can help in each of these domains andI'd say we already know that there'smany places this can happen and we'restill expanding the possibilities ofwhere generative AI can do more to helpus solve these real problems inpreventing threats the most interestingmissionis to say if you borrow from the medicalworldwe may not be able to prevent patientzero in all cases but how can we preventpatient one patient two patient threehow can we make it so a bad actor canuse a new and novel technique once atmost not hundreds or thousands of timeswhich is the common practice today uhtoil how can we move to a world wherehumans are using their brains to do whatonly humans can do and a lot of thedrudgery the monotony the you know alerttriage review all that copy and pastebetween different tools how can we takea huge chunk of that out of the dailylife so security personnel and how canwe bothmake it so that each individual on yoursecurity team does more is capable ofhaving more impact but also how do wehelp those people who are new in careerto up level their skill set again theseare places where we see generative AIbeing very helpfulwe've announced uh a few first party inour in our current security tools we'veannounced duet Ai and a few scenarios ifany of you caught the main keynoteyesterday or the security Spotlightkeynote today we did a bunch of Demos inthose I'd encourage people to watch themif they weren't able to see them I thinkit's pretty exciting some of thecapabilities we're bringing to bear andjust very briefly I'll hit on three ofthem you know mandian threatintelligence is of course one of themost trusted resources to learn abouteverything we know as mandian andeverything we know now with Mandy andGoogle fused together about the threatlandscape from doing over a thousandincident response investigations everyyear the worst of the worst breaches inthe world and taking the techniques andtactics that we find there synthesizingthem attaching them to the actors whoare abusing good people on the planetand then making it so that you can takeadvantage of that and protect yourselfthe beautiful thing about it is how muchinformation we have and the worst thingabout it is how much information we havebecause if you go start researchingthreat actors that attack oil and gasgood luck it takes a long time this is aclassic example of where generative AIcan help you find what you're lookingfor summarize it help you prepare thereports or the tools you might bepreparing to protect your organizationChronicle security operations are Simtakes intremendous amounts of data helps yousynthesize it and make it actionableit's amazing sub-second search acrosspetite acts of information and there's alearning curveyesterday you had to learn the syntax ofudm and Yara l in order to be trulyproficient in the tool and now we'veadded natural language conversion to sothat you can get going faster be moreproductive and kind of learn as you goanother as well as places like you havea complex case you understand what'sgoing onbut do you have to be an expert or do wehelp summarize for you what we're seeingand allow you to dig in when you dig inthese are the kinds of things thatgenerative AIS is doing and and last butnot least in security Command Centerwhich is our tool that helps protectyour workloads on gcp we're doing a lotto help you understand not justtheoretical vulnerabilities but theactual exploitable attack paths lookingat your configuration what's actuallyexploitable and helping you prioritizebut againto really get the most out of thatyesterday you needed to be pretty deepin security generative AI can helptranslate some of that up level it haveyou focus on where you need to focus andeven help you with the recommendationsand the actions you should take to fixit these are three examples of whatwe're doing in our current products butwhat we're really here to talk abouttoday is what's powering this and howare we taking a platform approachto generative AIand this is a fancy diagram that has alot of conf of information on it but Iwant to tell the story of what led tothis very briefly you know parts ofGoogle have been working on AI for overa decade and you know everyone I thinkknows at this point that you knowGoogle's been involved in generative AIfrom the very beginning doing some ofthe foundational researchI and some parts of my team have beendoing AI for a while but we have notbeen doing generative AI for five yearsand when we started last year sayingwe're going to dig in we see thepotential of generative AI we did notday one say we're going to build aplatform and open that up to the worldto come and build security use caseswith partners and customers what we didis we said this seems really usefullet's figure out how to use it in ourproducts and we started we got thebenefit of building on top of thefoundational knowledge uh that thatother parts of Google have been workingon and so that's awesome we got a headstart of doing that but it turns outthose foundational models while they'retrained on Amazing data and on Amazingscenarios we're not very good atsecurityand they're not good at security becausesecurity has a lot of jargon that's notgenerally available the jargon isconstantly changing it's got a lot ofproprietary data that's just notavailable in the training sets and sowhat we quickly learned is we needed toactually make a security llmand so we started bringing data sourcesthat we had because as Google we have alot of data at our fingertips and Mandyand now part of Google Cloud alsobrought a tremendous amount ofinformation about security about threatactors and things like this we startedtraining this and out of this came whatwe call SEC Palm which is the newsecurity LOM that is trained to speakthe language of security very very welland around that we've wrapped thesecurity AI workbench and security andthis is important because it turns outjust giving you a model isn't enoughit's giving you the tools to actually beproductive with that model in a varietyof applications and use caseswe're using that ourselves in theproducts I talked about for a minutewe're working with a variety of Partnersand customers to help bring that to themand this is all important and it's evenmore important that it's built on top ofvertex AI which is of course GoogleCloud's AI platform and we get we get alot of things as being part of thatbuilt on top of vertex Ai and one of oneof the best selfishly from myperspective as a security guy is I don'thave to start and think about how Ibuild all the Enterprise price gradecontrols that that every customer I'vetalked to and every partner I've talkedto that that has this top of mindquestion how do I secure it how do Imake sure there's not data leakage whatif it's really proprietary data I don'twant other people to have access tothese are problems that vertex has beenworking on and solving and buildingcontrols for for years and we'reextending those controls now togenerative Ai and so this is the storythat got us to the aha moment that saidas we started building this we realizedit's hard it requires a lot of uniquedata and it requires constant Evolutionbecause security changes and thereforethe model has to change because themodel has to speak the current languageof security at any point in time it'snot enough that it speaks what securitylooked like a year ago or two years agoand so as we did that we said we needthis for ourselves other people need ittoo we need to open this up and we thinkit's importantthat it's important to any it's buildingup a real platform ecosystem and apartner ecosystem is hard it takes timeand energy and lots of you know goodcollaboration and trust and many otherthings but one of the things we think isimportant is that is that we're bothusing it ourselves and working withpartners and I think we get the bestecosystems when you have that kind ofdynamic where you have the directfeedback from using it yourself thedirect feedback from a set of trustedPartners head onvery quickly we build security i oworkbench on top of vertex AI for peoplebuilding AI whether they're Partnersextending their Security Solutions andbringing them to you all as customers orwhether you're a customer who'sstitching together a workflow orextending something proprietary in yourenvironmentI won't read everything on this slide Iwill emphasize one thing your data yourterms from the beginning we knew thiswas important we already spent yearsbuilding these controls into Googlecloud and vertex and we're now extendingthose into into the work we're doing ingenerative Ai and security AI workbenchI've mentioned this a couple of timesbut again to emphasize all this is builton vertex AI it is we recognize thereare a set of security specific use casesbut there are also many use cases thatare some securitysome other things and we're actuallyseeing some of the most interestingscenarios coming from the blending ofI'd say business productivity driven usecases and core security driven use casesand how all that comes together and oneof the great things about vertex is itgives you access to everything Googleknows about Ai and you can stitch thattogether in whatever way you wantat a high levelum as we've been working with partnersand customers and kind of exploring thisourselves there are three big categoriesof use cases that we're seeing emergeright now that we think are very wellsuited to degenerative Ai and veryinteresting again I won't read the slidebut but summarization classification andand generation and applying that to theuse cases of securityum and we've made a lot of progress inyou know the relatively short time thatwe've been working on this and workingwith partnersuh it's important to note that as youthink about working with generative Aiand specifically with SEC palm and AIworkbench uh kind of two high-levelchoices a lot of people that we'reworking with are saying you know what alittle bit of prompt engineering the thework you've done to train the model isgreat with a little bit of promptengineering we can have something reallyuseful for our use case in otherscenarios people are saying look I needto extend this I need to write what usedto be called a plug-in but I was toldyesterday I can't say plug-in anymoreand I now have to say extension so anextension that uh that accessesreal-time data or proprietary data thatyou have and brings it into the model atinference time so that it can forminteresting and correct conclusionsof coursesecurity AI workbench as I said fitsinto vertex AI into generative AI Studiowe give you the tools at your fingertipsto do all the experimentation that youneed to do all the fine tuning you needto do the prompt engineer you need to doand you know this is a quickly movingfield you should expect that those toolswere getting better and better you knowon a regular basisjust say a quick thing we announced thatwe were doing security AI workbench inSEC Palm 2 at RSA this year so only whatfour months ago uh and at the time weannounced that Accenture was joining uson this journey as the first partner tohelp us both build that foundationalmodel as well as start to extend andexplore some of these use cases and itand and I thought it would beinteresting to share very quickly whathave we learned in four months I mean itseemed like a lot of time but I'll tellyou it's been a lot of work in 4.4monthsand I think there's a couple of thingsone is you knowfor all that the foundational llms areare really amazing and getting betterall the time for all the the work we'vedone to extend and build the securityllm uh prompt engineering is stillimportant and it's a it's a skill andit's a skill that a lot of parts of theindustry I think are realizing they needto build it's not like there's justenough people who know how to do promptengineering so this is about us as anindustry building the capability to godo this and a lot of the customers andpartners we interacted with at thebeginning are kind ofdidn't recognize that was important andin a lot of cases it's been hey let'shelp get your bootstrapped and startworking on that journey of kind ofbuilding that capabilityuh it's been a lot of talk abouthallucinations around generative Ai andtechniques to avoid hallucinations likegrounding uh and I think but but there'san interesting thing which is which isone of the things that welove about generative AI is I'll saythat what feels like creativity ofcourse it's not actual creativity butwhat feels like creativity of theseum is part of what makes them productiveand useful and and we're finding thatthere's a fine line betweenyou know locking down a model so muchthat it can never hallucinateand do you destroy what you're trying toget from a productivity and so there's abalance to be found there and we'rewe're building techniques and evolvingtechniques for grounding in certaincategories of dataum so that you know it can be useful inall the dimensions because of coursenobody wants misleading advicewe've alsoheard many use cases many ideas ofplaces we could do more in security andcompliance and privacy policy thingslike thatgenerally there's a convergence around afew of these scenarios that are on theslide lots of people see the need forthat in the daily operations of theirteamswe are hearing more and more aboutwanting to do more with code wanting todo more with policy wanting to do morewith compliance and I think as anindustry we'll get there but crawl walkrunuh and then finally the just thediversity of Readiness of organizationsand I say this was with absolutely nojudgment and lots of humility as aperson who if you'd ask me you know 18months ago I probably couldn't havespelled Transformer and now I spend asignificant percentage of every daythinking about Ai and working on AI witha bunch of people in the team and so itit I think it's clear that differentpeople are in different places and kindof the best advice I can give toeverybody is regardless of where you areon the journeyyou know make sure you're takingconscious steps to learn and evolve yourown business and looking for places thatit's useful to youI want to highlight at RSA four monthsago we we said Accenture was joining uson the journeya few months later we announced a set ofother partners who are joining us on thejourney and big shout out if there'sanother Accenture in the room becauseRex is going to come up in a minute butuhum you knowwe are better thanks to the partnershiphere and we have other partners comingon board and we'll announce that moreand more over time but the the breadthof these partners and them pushing ourthinking on scenarios and giving usfeedback on what's working what's notworkingum super valuable in the journey becauseit is we're all learning how generativeAI can make securitybetter than it has beenuh as a quote from the head of Accenturesecurity whichwhich I think is pretty awesome andthat's a good segue to invite my friendRex up to stage and as I mentioned we'vebeen hard at work with them for a whilenow and it was kind enough to to agreeto both come on stage but also to sharesome of the work that they've been doingso I think we're gonna roll a video andthen chat about it for a minute if ifvideo workslet's hope sothere we goin cyber security the threat landscapeis rapidly evolving security operationscenters are challenged to hire retainand scale the right people deploy adoptand sustain the right Technologies andaccelerate responses to theunpredictable threat landscape time toresponse is a critical factor inpreventing a catastrophic securitybreacha new threat actors activity has beenattributed to the temp dot Armageddoncampaign where they leveraged a Cobaltstrike Beacon to deliver a maliciouspayload to multiple corporations Pat asecurity intelligence analyst foraccenture's managed extended detectionand response team noticed the new threatthat could directly impact companyassets Pat quickly logged into the mxdrplatform powered by the Google Cloud AIsecurity workbench and reviewed thecurrent detection logic he noticed therewasn't a rule that would monitor oralert for this new BehaviorPat created a new rule and then enabledthe Retro hunt of the rule to determineif this threat actor was already insidea client's environment after the Retrohunt completes the security AI assistantwill send out a Cobalt strike alertSam is a security operations centeranalyst on the same team as PatSam worked with his soccer team toinitially develop and deploy the currentthreat detection rules at the time Samand his Tier 1

securityAI assistant this would take hoursit's just one analyst story at scale anorganization would benefit from 80 to 90Time Savings allowing analysts to focuson important and critical tasksyeah well it's so cool to see obviouslyI've seen it before but uh so cool tosee the progress that Accenture has madeand I'd love to just hear a little bitabout the journey right yeah no it wassuper exciting so when we met at RSA andI know Connie and Jonathan are here andthey put a lot of work into this andScott as well you know we went out toyou know it's all new to us right wewent out we identified 70 plus use casesthat we wanted to do and then we metwith your team and found out that youwere doing 30 of themand so we didn't want to be redundantand so we focused on on what made senseto work on and and they think you knowthe the two areas that we found you knowin your thing were Toil and scale rightthose are the two areas that we focusedon because we feel there's not enoughSecurity Professionals in the worldum to do this and so if we can automatea lot of these tasks and get peopledoing the right kind of work we can helpyou know scale this this business fromthat perspective I think thecollaboration we talked about promptengineering and all that I mean we sentover a boatload of prompts and it didn'tworkand then we had to refine and learn andand I think that journey and thatprocess and the collaboration betweenthe two teams I mean this actually worksthat's in our mxdr portal right now andthe thing is that we if we showed it toyou it would be like a two-minute demoand you'd be like oh so we had to put astory around it that's why that's allthe drama and the voices but do but Ithink but I think the collaboration withyour team has been you know Bar Noneamazing and I think you know and andthis is just one of the use cases theother one around around Cloud securityand and the auto remediation and codegeneration is super amazing too but yeahso that's kind of it from thatperspective any uh any advice to folkswho are maybe a little earlier on thejourney on you know things to focus onthings to think about wow yeah I thinkthe thing the mistake that we made is wethought we wanted to do our own llminitially right and then what we quicklyrealized is that it's about the data andthe Telemetry and who has that trustedsecurity data and the reason we'reexcited I'm working with SEC promisebecause I think we talked about you have80 of the internet you have all themandated threat until you have you knowthe virus total deep mind all that allthat data and and being able to trainand have access to that and and and toyou know to be able to provide theprompts and then leverage our ownextensions to create our own unique IPSit's super important so it's about moreabout understanding what's out there andwhat can be trusted because I think youtalked about insights versushallucinations I thought that was quitea fascinating thing you know it you aregoing to have you know somehallucinations I think on the cloudpiece we struggled with that a bit butwe we were able to train and tune anddrive that to where we had enoughefficacy to feel that we would get morevalue out of it than worried about youknow the two percent of hallucinationsthat we would give right from from thatperspective so well that's awesomewell uh any kind of parting thoughts forfolks who are on the journey or any orany you know beat me up about anythingon stage no I think no I think you knowthe one thing I can say is you knowwe've been working with your team for ayear now once we decided to re-platformand and and the collaboration that we'vebeen able to do with you guys as far nowit's you you guys are huge but you actsmall I think that the collaboration theability to work together and drive thesemeaningful pieces is super important Ithink the other thing is you knowunderstand from your partners whatthey're already developing because youdon't want to build redundantcapabilities right I think that was stepone for us and and then you know whatwe've done is is they stopped here andwe took it from there and then you'regetting double the work double the valueout of it versus trying to buildsomething that's already going to be outthere from that perspective that'sawesome all right well thank you for thepartnership and thank you I look forwardto keeping working on this together[Applause]oh I used the wrong slideuh so next I want to bring up Jada Paulwho's the CSO at dun and Bradstreet agood customer great customer on gcpworking with us on security and AIyeah are you on oh can you guys hear meyeah there we goum so I'd love let me just introduceyourself talk a little bit about thedungeon Bradstreet journey and kind ofwhat you've been doing uh with us overthe last couple of years sure firstthanks for having me and we'll talk alittle bit about Donna brashery and whatwe are inwho we are and what we do uh mostnotably you know for those of you whoare familiar with the duns number whichis kind of something similar to a socialsecurity number uh as an individual oras a person it is a social securitynumber for your for your business and weare a global leader in decisioning dataand analytics so we have more data thanyou can possibly imagine and and when wetalk about what we're going to talkabout around gen Ai and models the datathe cleanliness the theum the quality is most important becausewhat comes in is you know what you getout soum as a CSO I'm I'm a strong believer inenabling you know the the role of theCSO has changed drastically over thelast you know let's say two to threeyears uh where we we need to reallyfocus on being more of an enabler versusyou know that historical department ofof no and I think this this opportunitywith what we're doing now with enablingthe organization to to leverage gen Aiand these llmsum is really a unique opportunity for usbecauseum you know hit you know it's alwaysbeen challenging for a CSO to find thatwhere do I drive value where do I offervalue outside of just protecting the organd truly this is one of those thoseopportunities for uswell that's awesome can you talk alittle bit I know you launched recentlythe the AI labs and you've been on thejourney with vertex and gcp can you justtalk a little bit about how that's gonefor sure I mean most recently I mean wewe actually had an announcement that hitthe wires yesterday with regards toJenny iLab so we we released gen AI Labsas an opportunity for us to co-innovatewith our customers right bring anopportunity for them to come in andbasically play with us and learn with usand build some someum you know innovative solutions andopportunities and yesterday we announceduh explicitly that vertex AI is a majorpart of that initiative and we arelargely building our labs around vertexAI capabilitiesthat's awesome thanks for the thecongratulations on the announcementthanks for the partnership what umwhat are the things I know that isgetting top of mind for peopleespecially as they're starting touse more AI techniques gender to AI isis how do we think about the security ofthose systems as well and I know this issomething you've thought a lot about youknow any thoughts on how you'reapproaching it and what we can do as anindustry yeah I mean first I'll talk alittle bit about the Journey of how wegot to where we're at with regards togcp itself we've been on this journeyfor about 18 months of building you knowgcp platform out secure by default rightyou guys Google calls it invisiblesecurity Etc but uh you know the idea ofbeing able to build a the platform fromthe ground up as codeum being it repeatable consumable forour devops teams for our data scientistswhen we talk a little bit about you knowsecuring models themselves I didn't wantthe teams to have to worry aboutsecuring the underlying infrastructure Iwanted that that's already the caseright so we're there and we built youknow again everything infrastructure ascode and we took a three-phased approachfirst being leveraging Google's gcp'sdefault capabilities yesterday therewere some really really good sessions ifyou missed them on you know kind ofbuilding gcp by default like you knowthe concept of the blueprints the thesecurity blueprints which is really uhthe way to you knowintroduce that secure by default andthen phase two of that really isbuilding consumable repeatable modulesso that they're secure by defaultthey're easily consumable and the teamsthat are building on top of them don'thave to worry about uh configuring themyou know or building them from scratchit's already a you know a predefinedmodel and then three is obviously thecompliances code making sure that nobodycan do anything that we otherwisewouldn't want them to do so when youtake care of that piecefocusing on protecting the modelsthemselves is where we're is what we'relooking for so that really comes down toyou knowprotecting data I mean a traditionalcyber program if done well you alreadyhave data security you already haveidentity management you know those areall still application product securityit all still core components to be ableto protect the model there are somenovel threats that are introduced as aresult ofyou know llms and whatnot and those arethe one-offs that you're going to haveto manage like poisoning and you knowprompt injection and all those thingsbut I think you take care ofthe basics you take care of you know 80of the risk yeah very goodum and as a as a Defender you knowyou and your team were on the trenchesof you know protecting the organizationand and as you think about the use casesand you saw some of the stuff from fromAccenture some of the stuff we'reworking on you know what jumps out atyou as being you know something youthink boy my team could take advantageof that or Boy I can't wait untilsomething capability comes first of allthat was that was a great demo that wasreally cool I do think I think a coupleof things lowering the barrier to entrythey we think of what llms andthings like chat GPT or bringing itslower the barrier to entry for threatactors right you know easier phishingemails Etcum same goes for cyber SecurityProfessionals right likethis is giving the opportunity forpeople to maybe do things that theywouldn't normally do or that they wouldnormally have to take some time to learnright like writing queries in inchronicle having that natural languageprocessing takes away the need to learnhow to write those things or analyzinglarge and large amounts of data I thinkyou've touched on it when you opened uplikewe are dealing more with more and moredata today than we ever have before butit's not possible for a human toto to be able to analyze all that datayou know is as as quickly or asefficiently or even you know uhrealistically as we would like so thisis giving llms and machine llms willgive an opportunity for us to be able touh process much more data much faster Ithink threat intelligence right largelyfor most threat intelligence programsthey are threat feeds you get a bunch ofIP addresses some hashes Etc uh andreally there's no context to it I dothink that gen AI is going to bring usalong with what you guys are doing withmandya bring us a a more contextuallyawareum threat intelligence capability toactually really pull the the needle outof the stack of needles so to speak andthen I think I think at some point Ithink we're not there yet applicationdevelopment secure coding will be anarea where we see gen AI offer somereally really strong capabilities it'ssafe it's going to take some time to getthere because of where the data iscoming from and what it's learning onbut I do eventually believe that thatwill be a a way to improve the developerexperience and get code to Market muchquicker than it securely much quickerthan that's happening today that's greatand and any advice for folks maybeearlier in the journey on things tothink about things just you know avoidstartyeah I would say a couple things Focusagain focus on the basicsdon't get too wrapped up on how advancedyou know generative AI is and you'reonly looking at the threats associatedwith it you do have to deal with thosebut the underlying stuff is really uhthe stuff that's going to protect youmost most of the way governance is superimportant don't start jumping right intodoing Tech and building models until youhave a good governance in place withyour with your legal team with yourcompliance team because at the end ofthe day that all of that is what mattersthe most when you're protecting yourintellectual property making sure thatyou're not using somebody else'sintellectual property so those thingsare are super importantum and and focus on the Frameworks rightyou've gotyou know you got secure AI Google hasits secure AI framework which is reallyset out to help you define a roadmap onon securely building uh gen AI systemsbut you know nist has this riskmanagement framework you know the miterAtlas framework allows us to do threatdetectionum and then top 10 has you know asspecific llm focus on on application uhrisks associated with the developingmodel so focus on the stuff and reallyfocus on the basics not don't try to gettoo caught up in being Advanced and thelast thing I'll say is when we talkabout models um you know what vertex AIhas brought to us I think is the idea ofthis end-to-end capability right wedon't have to worry about too much onthe inside it does sit inside ouraccount right so our data is our datait's not going anywhere you're bringingpreset defined models with the modelGarden so we don't have to worry as muchabout that through the you know the wayyou've built the platform and thisallows us to focus on the data let'sfocus on the front end what is gettingdeveloped to interact with the model andbe very careful about the models thatyou choose because you know the wrongmodel the wrong open source model couldcertainly have uh an adverse impact youknow on you as far as protectingintellectual property because there area lot of Open Source license models outthere that are unfavorable yeah to yourwork well thank you so much for being agreat customer and a great partner andcoming in and talking with the grouphere today thanks for having meforeign"
