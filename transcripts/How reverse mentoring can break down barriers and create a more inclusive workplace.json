youa problem statement so hopefully you cansee this diagram this illustrates theproblems leaders in our organizationshave to face todayso as a leader so our most seniorleaders are unaware of 96 of theproblems in their organization thiscomes from a 1989 study 96 so to make tojust reiterate that the people makingdecisions driving our organizations havevery little visibility into the actualproblems they're trying to solveon the other hand people who deal withcustomers on a day-to-day basis who areon the front line are completely awareof these problems the problem happenswith leadership as you become a leaderyou become less aware of the problemsyou're trying to solveeven though the organization has thedata you need it's really difficult tounlock it and as a leader part of ourjob is to actually figure out how do Ifind out these problems how do I reachout to the people on the front line andget the data I need to make betterdecisionsby the end of this session hopefully youwill realize that reverse mentoring is agreat tool you can use to do thisso my name is bhumisho ande I lead thecustomer engineering team for ourcorporate segment in the UK and IrelandI also recently completed an MBA fromWarwick Business School and for mydissertation I completed a study onreverse mentoring and that's the conceptwhich I'm going to share with you guystodayso I'll start with reverse mentoringwhat is it uh share my personal storywith reverse mentoring then I'll talkabout how I conducted my research andthen I will share the results of thatresearch as a series of recommendationsafter that we'll have some time to takesome questionsso what is reverse mentoringwe'll start by looking at thetraditional mentoring modelSo In traditional mentoring you have amentee who is usually Junior so that'stheir position or their roleusually youngerand has less work experience the mentoron the other hand usually most seniorenroll in position tends to be older andhas usually accumulated more experiencenow people change careers in laterstages of life so these descriptionsmight be different but most of the timeit's accuratenow during the mentoring process thementor transfers knowledge experienceand guidance to their menteethe goal is to get more positive careeroutcomes for their menteenow with reverse mentoring we invertthat Dynamic so we are going to flip thelabelsand our Mentor is now the junioremployee of the younger or the lessexperienced employee and our mentee isnow the senior employeesowhat happens is the transfer ofknowledge changes so it now goes in theopposite direction and you're nowtransferring your knowledge yourperspective your support and feedback toyour menteenow the outcome of this is differentbecause what ends up happening is youusually getmore positive career outcomes for bothparties so not just the uh mentee so I'mgoing to use these labels for the restof the conversation so Mentor will bereferring to the person on this sidementee will be referring to the personon that sideso let me share my personal story withreverse mentoring if you've ever read umsandberg's bookum lean in there's a chapter called willyou be my mentor and she talks about howshe finds it awkward and off-puttingwhen a woman approaches her out of theblue and asks her will you be my mentorsomeone she has no she's got norelationship with the person just walkup to her and she states in the bookthat if somebody has to ask her thequestion the answer is almost definitelygoing to be nobut the truth is there's there's asliver of Truth there that most peoplelook for mentors that look like them orcome from backgrounds similar to theirsum with reverse mentoring uh it's aslightly different Dynamic but before Icontinuepeople from underrepresented groups ingeneral have fewer mentors in theircareers it's a huge huge problemso it's a slightly different Dynamic soI'm going to share a personal story soin 2020 at the height of the pandemicsomeone asked my wife will you be myreverse mentornowboth of us had never heard of it so wewent online and researched it and werealized that actually it might besomething interestinghowever she felt she couldn't say nothis person was a sea level in anorganization very senior he recentlyagreed to become the racial equalitysponsor for the organization but he wasa white man who had grown up in ruralWales so he had no idea of the livedexperience of the group he was meant tobe supporting so he had a conversationwith the chief chief people officer andasked for some advice and she suggestedreverse mentoring together theyidentified my wife as a potentialreverse mentor and then he asked her thequestionnow six months later fast forward and hewas now sharing back to the organizationeverything he'd learned in six monthsand how you put them into practice inhis role as Russian equality sponsorthis was during the pandemic sobasically this meeting happened in myliving room and I happened to overheareverythingum but I remember listening to it and itreally really struck me how much he'dlearned in such a short time and how itactually put that into effect and Isuddenly realized this was something Iwanted to experience myself so at thetime I was considering moving into amanagement role and one of the firstthings I said I would do as a managerwas I would look for a reverse mentor sothat was 2020 I was working in aslightly a different team and then in2021 I started my new role as a managerand I reached out to a colleague who wasvery familiar with reverse mentoring andI asked her to nominate someone on herteam to be my reverse mentormany well just before the pandemic notthat long uh I had a meeting with aformer colleague and I left that meetingreally strong because she explained alot of what she had to put up with andhow she had to change her behavior inthe office just to fit in and I rememberleaving that meeting many years agothinking I don't want that to everhappen to a woman I work with againbut I I then realized that my knowledgeof the problems women face in theworkplace was actually very skin deepand I wanted to actually get a betterperspective of how I could support womenon my team at the time I had a team ofseven menum so I asked for a woman but I alsowanted to look into our recruitmentprocess from the perspective of acandidate so I asked a woman who'd beenhired recentlyum just uh and I also wanted to look atthe onboarding process we had for newEngineers to see if there were any holesthat I might need to plug as a newmanager so Along Came Esther into mylife so she was introduced to me as apotential reverse Mentor I asked her thequestion and she said yes thankfully soat the time Esther had been in Googlefor about four months she was completelynew to sales never worked in salesbeforeum she was act and I didn't know thisshe was really struggling with impostersyndrome but her manager told me she's areal high potential for us and hopefullyyou can get what you want and help herat the same time so we worked togetherfor about a year and we still meet on aregular basisin terms of results it's been extremelypositive for both of us so I achieved mygoal of improving representation on myteam and I actually started a new roleearlier this year as a Senior Managementrole Esther interviewed me multipletimes as I Was preparing to do myinterviewsum and she looked through my CV and shegave me a lot of guidanceon the other on the other hand Estherhas been incredibly successful in hertime at Google so one of the firstconversations we had she was looking fora more specialized role and she movedinto that role uh I think a few monthsafter we started working together inthat role she's really really thrivedshe's been promoted twice in the lasttwo yearsso I was I've been very fortunate to bepart of her journey and I know there'sstill a lot more to come from her sobased on this experience to me I I nowhad two very positive experiences ofreverse mentoring I was a huge fanuh now I was doing an MBA at the timeand getting to the point where I neededto pick a dissertation topicactually picked a different topicbut one of the in my brief I had a listof ways to drive diversity in theorganization and reverse military was onthat listsomehow the professor who was meant tojust assign me a supervisor saw that andsaid I've never heard of reversementoring what is itand then we started talking 20 minutesinto the conversation he then said stopI think I'm going to you're going tohate me but I think you're writing thewrong topicI think you should change your topicthis was going to set me back about amonth or so but he said forget what youroriginal topic was reverse mentoringthis is what you should write about inhindsight it was obvious I had a lot ofknowledge about it I was quitepassionate about it uh so in the end itwas kind of a no-brainer and I listenedreflected I said yeah I think I'll takeyour advice and I'll do the study onreverse mentoring so going into theresearch like I said earlier my view ofreverse memory was incredibly positivethis is still the case but I've alsorealized that there are potentialpitfalls that you need to watch out forso I'll come to that later but let me gointo how I went about my research firstso first thing I did was I did aliterature review and I looked at anyacademic papers that had been written onthe wrestlementary I didn't have as manyas most of my other classmates but onething I did notice was that there's asudden Spike from around 2018 and that'sa little bit sustained going into 2021so most of the research was written inthe last six years or somost so when I looked into the historyof reverse mentoring I realized thatmost people think it was invented byJack Welch the legendary CEO of uhGE so in 1999 he asked the lady calledPam Wickham who was 37 to become hismentorand they had regularly scheduledmeetings and those meetings were used toteach Jack Welch how to use this newtechnology called the internetum when he finished going through thoseum the reverse mentoring he then askedthe top 500 managers in GE to do exactlythe same thing he asked them to identifypeople to teach them how to use theinternet because he thought that maybethis technology was going to change theway we workso that's what most of the academicpapers found however in reality a yearbefore that the American dieteticAssociation had already done this so soin 1998 they went into the universitiesand found students to reverse Mentortheir members on how to use the internetthe same thing now at the beginning ofreverse mentoring most people used it tolearn how to use technology that youngerpeople tended to be more familiar withso you see a lot of views for in for theinternet and moving forward when socialmedia became a thing it was to teachsome Executives how to use social mediamore effectivelyhowever it now has a really strong linkwith diversity and inclusionparticularly inclusion because if ourleaders are more aware of problemsunderrepresented groups are facing inthe workplace they can actually createan atmosphere that these people canthrive inand I found this in my research and alsowhen I did my interviews which I'll cometo shortly Procter and Gamble was thefirst company in the academic researchanyway that did this so in 2005 they hadthis problem with attrition with theirfemale employees so they got all theirsenior managers who were mostly mento be Reverse mentored by femaleemployees and it led to a much betterunderstanding of the problems the womenwere facing in the workplacenow my favorite example of how reversementoring Works was published in theBritish medical journal of all places in2021so to State the problem they werelooking to solve there is a lot ofdiversity when you look at students inmedical school in the UK however whenyou look at the field of doctors whenyou move to where they've graduatedthere is very little diversity in thatgroup what they realized was that therewas very high attrition for people incertain communitiesso it's certain racial backgrounds andpeople that came from poor socioeconomicbackgroundsand they wanted to see what they coulddo as a university to improve thatexperience so what they did was forthree months they got students toreverse Mentor The Faculty of theUniversitysobefore that program started the staffwere asked to write a narrative aboutthe higher education journey of anunderrepresented medical studentafter the reverse mentoring interventionthey were not asked to rewrite thatnarrativeso the first set of narratives revealeda very superficial understanding of thatstudent Journey so for example theyacknowledge that the students workedvery very hard to get to where they wereand that now that they were enrolled inmedical school everything was going tobe fine it was a fairy tale ending theywere going to get out of poverty becausethey were going to become doctorsand when the students dropped out it wasbecause of something wrong with them thedeficit was on the students maybebecause nobody in their family had everbeen to University they didn't haveanybody to help them guide them throughuh the university lifeum and in in those fairy tale endingsthe medical school was had effectivelyrescued the students from the lives theywere livingafter just three or four meetingsbecause this was over just three monthsthere was a notable change in perceptionso what ended up happening was they hada much deeper understanding and therewas a shift in responsibilityso the students were now seen as capableagents uh they they acknowledged thatthe students were actually operating inwhat was a challenging environment forthemthe faculty had always been in aposition to make things easier for thestudents they just didn't realize theproblems they were having so the endingswere a lot more pragmatic and themedical school getting there was greatbut it created a whole new set ofproblems that these students weren'treally equipped to handleuh and the medical school was now seenas responsible so they were the ones whohad to come up with Solutions not thestudents so a very practical issueraised at one of the meetings was thatone of the students did not have arelative who earned enough money toguarantee his rent so he was unable toget accommodation at the University andnow you can imagine what going toUniversity with no accommodation wouldbe like but that's one of the reasonswhy a lot of these students weredropping out was just no one could helpthem to underwrite their accommodationum rent agreementsnow there was one area that saw verylittle improvements and that was arounddiscrimination and racismand it's a complex topic but effectivelysome of the faculty felt that thestudents were being a bit accusativewhen they were saying there's no staffmember that looks like me and that thatdoesn't help me so they got very verydefensive when they were talking aboutthis topic both in both narrativesbefore and after but like I said it wasa three-month program so this is a muchharder problem to solveso with all this in mind I decided to gointo my research the objectives werequite simple what do people highlightwhen you talk about reverse venturing uhwhat motivates people to participate andwhat is the best way to implementreverse mentoring so I said aboutGathering data so the summer of 2022I conducted 19 interviewsum with people who had been menteesmentors and people who had organizedreverse mentoring programs in differentorganizations across three differentcontinents I was lucky enough to findfour reverse mentoring pairs so I spoketo the mentor and the mentee in thosepairs and I was able to gather insightsfrom both sides of those relationshipsso in the interest of time I'm going toshare my findings in the form ofrecommendationsso I'll start with organizations lookingto organize reverse mentoring so thefirst step is recruitment so you need torecruit your mentors and your menteesfor mentors you need to select peoplereally really carefully you're notlooking for someone who vents a lotabout problems you want someone who cangive constructive feedback to a seniorleader rather than just use thesemeetings as a space to just complainuh and for mentees you're looking forpeople who are open to learning frompeople who they might regard as lessexperience younger so you need someonewho is very very open to learning fromother people uh particularly peopleJunior to themwhile you can encourage people to signup it's very very it's problematic whenit's compulsory because that leads to alot of behaviors that later down theline could cause problemsa reverse Mentor should not be pairedwith someone who ultimately theirmanager reports to this causes problemsfor both parties the mentor will not beable to give honest feedback becausethey don't want to pay their manager inuh bad lights and on the other hand thementor also experiences a lot ofproblems with their peers because anysuccess they get ultimately people willwrite it up to favoritism on the behalfof their mentee and in two cases where Ifound this in uh in my interviews thementees were not even aware of all theproblems that mentors were facingbecause of um the fact that the two ofthem were speaking together uh amentoring agreement is really useful itsets out a number of things soexplaining exactly what each role doesone person I spoke to said their reverseMentor was looking for a traditionalmentor and came in thinking that that'swhat they were going to get thatrelationship was ultimately unsuccessfulbecause the reverse the mentee waslooking to gain a lot of knowledgerather than being a traditional Mentorso it was the wrong program for theother party so clearly stating what eachrule what is expected for each role inthat mentioning agreement goes a reallylong way you can also talk about theCadence suggested Cadence for meetingsuh how long the mentoring relationshipshould last and most of them and I'vealready talked about the rules so havinga suggested list of topics to discussalso helps so for people that don'timmediately have chemistry when theyfirst meet this list will give them sometopics they can talk about so that therelationship can later on evolve intosomething more natural but for somepeople who just immediately don't get onthis really really helps now you have tobe aware for reverse mentoring pairyou're looking for people that aredifferent enough that they can learnfrom each other but similar enough thatthey can actually talk to each other soit's a really really tricky thing tomatch people when you're doing thisthe number one finding however in myresearch was that a lot of people werefailing in the duty of care to thementorsnow with every single person I spoke toaccept maybe onethe reverse mentoring program wasactually designed around the leaders inthe organization so the menteesso the mentors in some cases were almostan after faultso when they and the other thing I'vetalked about is for most people when youget approached by a senior leader tobecome their reverse Mentor it's reallyreally hard to say noso a lot of the mentors were acting outof obligationsome of them were not enjoying thereverse mentoring but they had no onethat they could that could help extractthem from those relationshipsumand then in some cases the organizationsthat were running reverse mentoring theywere asking the mentees for regularfeedbackhow is it getting on what are youlearningum but nobody's thoughts to ask thementorsso nobody actually sat down with themand said how is it going are you gettinganything out of this how's yourrelationship going so nobody was doingthat check and as a result a lot ofmentors mentors were suffering insilence as it werethere was one case where the mentor saidhe felt like a textbook so thisgentleman is paralyzed from the neckdownum he reverse mentored a lot of peoplein the past but he had this particularmentee who literally went line by linethrough their disability guide and wasasking for his opinion on stuff didn'teven bother forming a relationship hewas just interested in the informationhe could get and that was a reallyuncomfortable experience and he saidlook at that point I just counted downto the end of the relationship Icouldn't wait for this to endnow one other thing I found is if yourreverse mentoring program is designedaround an underrepresented group bydefinition you're talking about a verysmall population of the organizationjust by definitionso what most organizations did was theyused the same mentors again and againand again now for a lot of these peoplethey were describing times that they'dgone through really difficultexperiences discrimination uh racism insome cases where people are treated themunfairly and they found that the reversementoring was effectively making themrelive in some cases trauma again andagain and againum and that what some organizations didso two organizations I found hadidentified this problem quite early soone of themended up giving reverse mentors two-yearbreaks between relationships just toallow them to recover mentallythe other one Incorporated the reversementoring into their graduate program sothat meant that they had a steady streamof new mentors every year and thenthere's a third method which anotherorganization used but I'll talk aboutthat later onnowum in one organization they had areverse mentoring scheme that was basedon raceand everything I just talked abouthappened and in the end five of thereverse mentors resigned and theyactually stated that they were resigningbecause of the reverse mentioningprogramone of them said he felt like hismentees treated him like a black historyprofessor and he just got tired of itum they felt they weren't gaininganything from the reverse Venture andthis wasn't quite true the organizationwas changing but they didn't actuallyfeel the effects of itum and in the end those relationshipswere One Direction so the mentees weregaining a lot the organization wasgaining a lot the one person who wassuffering was the mentorwhen reverse mentoring works at its bestit's bi-directional so both partiesgained so the examples I gave youearlier illustrate how it's actuallyrelatively easy to do it in a way thatboth people gain so one thing I didn'tmention about my wife is since thatreverse mentoring she got promoted andshe's not actually a director andorganizationum so in both cases that I I wasfamiliar with and in most of the peopleI interviewed a lot of people actuallygain from participating in Reversementoring but in this particularorganization they were really reallystruggling when they had thiseffectively the harassmentors came as agroup and asked to end the programnow uh mentors like I said act out of umobligation but not just that some ofthem actually they take it they arequite sacrificial so a lot of people Ispoke to said I'm doing this to makesure that the next women that joinedthis organization don't have to gothrough what I went through uh I spoketo someone in the military who said I'mdoing this to make sure that the nextpeople who come and join thisorganization after I leave have a muchbetter experience than I did so theyhave that sacrificial approach and inmany cases they are not even aware thatthey could potentially gain from therelationships so one piece of adviceI'll give you is when you're designing areverse mentoring program the easy thingto do is to design it around your uhmentees but consider putting yourmentors at the center instead thatreally really does help because bothparties will eventually gain but ifyou're more deliberate about centeringit on your mentors so possibly evenmaking a bi-directional program from thebeginning it's a lot more effectiveso what do organizations benefit fromwhen they go through reverse mentoringyou're getting improved retention sothere's less attrition not just yourmentors but your mentees and I'll comeback to that at the end of thepresentationyou get leadership development theorganization I spoke to who Incorporatedreverse Venture into the graduateprogram said and they called it anunexpected benefits was it really reallyenhanced theum graduate program they said itenriched it because all of a sudden theyrealized that these people were joiningthe organization and very quicklyunderstanding the politics the structureinformation that would have taken themyears to actually accumulate they weregetting in just a few monthsum but it was really interesting that tothem it was they never actually saw itas a benefit it was an unintendedbenefitso you get better more inclusive moreinformed leaders going forward rememberthe iceberg of ignorance I started withand your organization becomes morenetworked so you're creating linksacross your organization that wouldn'tnormally exist people who wouldn'tnormally be friends are now friendsacross seniority levels across differentage groups across different teams evenso if somebody asks you would you be myreverse Mentor like I saidmost peopleum can't feel that they can't say no buta lot of mentors are filled with doubtsif you're like any of the people I speakto you're terrified there's a lot ofpressure what do I have to give thetruth is you would not have beenapproached if you had nothing to offerso don't doubt yourself you may not havethe experience your mentee has this isfine this is normal but the truth is youcan actually contribute a lot to therelationship your lived experience isunique to you and that's what yourmentee wants to learn about so thosefirst few meetings might be awkward butif you push through you start to getmore comfortable and more confidentdon't be afraid to ask your mentee foradvice or guidance a lot of the mentorsI spoke to they felt they couldn't do itbecause as far as they were concernedthe program was designed to help theirmentee and they really felt that theycouldn't ask for career advicethemselves but don't be afraid a lot ofthe mentees I spoke to were so gratefulfor what they gain from their mentorsthat they were looking to actually seewhat they could do to help already and alot of these questions that were neverasked were opportunities for the menteesthat went that just went without anywithout any helpnow for mentees the best mentees I foundwere people who had that real hunger tolearn people who felt that you knowthere's a lot I can actually gain fromthis and they went into those programsreally open to learn from their mentorslook to see how you can help your mentorgive back so your Mentor is not atextbook I can't state that enough it'syour Mentor is not a textbook they arenot there to just help you look so foropportunities if you do anythingum in your organization that you you gotthe idea from your Mentor credit themwith thatand your mentor needs to trust youbefore they open up so that will nothappen automatically you will need towork at it and in my research there werethree things the best mentees did inorder to gain that trust the first wasprioritizing time with mentors so therewas a mentor who walked he said he wouldwalk into his mentee's office and theywill be doing a meeting he would end themeeting and kick everybody out just tomeet with him that made him feel reallyreally important another person said hewould actually be invited to sit downobserve the meeting and when theystarted their own meeting the menteewould start with saying right give mefeedback on how you felt I acted in thatmeeting and all of a sudden you're likeokay if he's taking things thisseriously I need to take thingsseriouslybe present during the meetings these arenot up times for you to startmultitasking and doing email whileyou're talking so the best Mentormentees ended up they would be very veryfocused notes uh sometimes taking notesbut fully attentive playing back whatthey've heardand then finally the best mentees werepeople who they took what they'd learnedand put it into action there was onegreat example of there was a livingallowance for people for graduatesliving in London that was no longereconomically viable so the mentormentioned this in one of their firstmeetings the mentee went andinvestigated and realized it hadn't beenreviewed for years so he approached theHR team they reviewed it and beforetheir next meeting he was happy to tellthe mentor that good news that has beenrevised and starting from next monthyou'll be getting a lot more money thatsmall action he took led to a massiveum outpouring of support from his mentorand their relationship just went inLeaps and Bounds so so many otherexamples there was another lady who acustomer had been effectively veryracist and very sexist towards her shereported it to her manager but hermanager felt that because it was apaying customer the company couldn't doanything so this had happened to yearsprior when she mentioned it to hermentee he was livid and he went back tothe company and said we need to supportour people when these things happen wecan't just sweep them under the carpetand then he took action and then theylater outlined policy so that in thefuture if a customer treats an employeebadly there was a process to be followedso in conclusion when I started theresearch I was incredibly positive likeI said there's a lot of pitfalls as Ifound outum but I'm pleased to say that theorganization that had a lot of peopleresign have really turned things aroundso they did they had a lot a number ofchanges so they implemented it as a newprogram as a bi-directional program theyhad an Innovative way of increasing thepopulation of underrepresented groups byopening up the program to people whoweren't in the organization so theyinvited other companies to take part inthat bi-directional program uh and inthe last two years they've not only seenincreased retention but what they'veseen which they didn't get with theprevious program is a lot of the peoplethe underrepresented groups are nowprogressing faster through theorganization so they're really reallypleased with the resultsum and with that in mind I would urgeyou to give reverse mentoring a go it'scost effective in that it literallydoesn't cost you anythingum there's benefits to everyoneum like I said you will need to preparelook after your mentors if you look atthe group mentors mentees organizationsthey've got the least agency and as aresult they will need your support somake sure you're looking after yourmentors remember that duty of care andthen finally uh on the engagements a lotof senior leaders particularly thosecloser to the end of their career thanthe beginningit's really really hard to find genuinetraining and development opportunitiesfor themreverse mentoring is a genuine Learningand Development tool that you can usewith anyone and for a lot of this groupin particular they find that there'sincreased engagement simply becausethey're now understanding uh a lot moreabout different Generationsunderstanding a lot more about theorganization and they're able toactually be more effective at workin networks across seniority levels andthen the other thing reverse mentoringdoes is when you have organizationaldiversity you can actually harness it soyou have a lot of companies talk aboutbuilding diverse um organizations youhire all these people but you're notactually tapping into what they bringinto your organization reversementioning actually allows you to dothat so thank you very much for yourtime this morning I just wanted tosignpost a couple of other sessions inthe Dei track happening today uh pleaseplease please give me some feedback uhwhen you get a chancethank youforeign"
