thesession we decided to make a keystrategic decision we decided toorganize the speakers in the ascendingorder of how good they arevery good morning to all of you I'm yourfirst Speaker Ganeshdirector of product at Google workspaceI will be joined in a bit by threeeminent speakers from our Marqueecustomers to share their perspectives ontheir sovereignty Journey with all ofyouand we'll save time for Q a at the endand we're happy to interact with all ofyou after the session as wellso with that let's get startedlet's begin by talking about digitalsovereignty it's a journey that we'vebeen on over many years been workingwith many customers and partners of oursas we kind of think through the Notionsof sovereignty and complianceorganizations around the world caredeeply about this subjectbecause they're keen on ensuring thatthey're engaging their respectivecustomers and stakeholders with trustthey obviously want to avoid compliancepenaltiesand most importantly they want to enabletheir Workforce and Empower them withthe Best in Class tools and do all ofthat in a sovereign and compliant mannernow when you think about the Notions ofsovereignty and compliance around thewhole world it can get prettymind-bogglingly crazy because the numberof three letter and four letter acronymsaround compliance I myself can'tremember each and every one of them andwhat they actually meanbut the Great Piece here is as we workedwith several governments Regulatorscustomers and organizations around theworld we've really distilled a lot ofthose compliance regulations down tothree key capabilities that reallymatterthe first is Authority and this isreally organizations wanting to ensurethat they have unhindered access totheir data on their termsthe second is confidentiality and thisis about organizations ensuring thatthey're in control and they preventunauthorized foreign access to theirdataand the third is privacy and securityneedless to say organizations all aroundthe world want to keep their data storedin a persistently private and securefashionnow what's been interesting is when youthink of these three key underlyingneeds for digital sovereigntythere's been this meme of data locationbeing the Panacea that solves it alland what's interesting about it is Datalocation really is inadequateand the reason I say this is when weengage on a journey of deeply evaluatingthe tech stack that customers are onespecially with Legacy Cloud providersthey're surprised often to discover keygaps in data location that severelycompromise their sovereignty posturelet me walk through a few of those keygapsfirst let's start with the notion ofinternational travelhow many of you here are at Cloud nextfrom outside the U.S how many of youhave traveled here from outside the U.Sby a show of handsfantastic there's quite a few of youthat have come here thank you for makingthe long trip around we hope you'rehaving a great timewhat we've realized is a lot of you whotravel around the worldespecially when you use a legacy cloudprovideryou're and you're really using a thickclienton your laptop in order to access yourCloud softwareand once you access things through athick client on your laptop instead of abrowser because the browser lacks fullfunctionality for legacy Cloud providerswhat you have on your device is thecache of the critical information thatyou're working onand that cashtravels with you and your laptopwherever you goso what that means isyour data is here todaywith us in Mosconethe second scenario is that of mobiledevicesI'm going to do a quick audience pollagainhow many of you use a Android phone by ashow of handsokay that's a fair number of youhow many of you use an iOS phonefantastichow many of you use a Windows phonechecking just checking for completenesswhat do you think happens when you get anotification on your device about thatsensitive email or about chat messagelet me tell youa whole copy of your data goes over to amobile notification server that is ownedby the companies that manufacture yourdevicewhat that means is there's a copy datalocated wherever you are but there's acopy going out of the span of control ofyour legacy cloud provider to anothercompany that owns the OS of your devicethe Thirdis foreign government accessand we all know that foreign governmentaccess is not predicated upon thelocation of data and happens regardlessof the location of dataand the fourth most importantlywe're in a pretty critical juncturetodaywhere Legacy Cloud providers are seeinga Spate of vulnerabilities that areexploitedthe statistics speak for themselvesif you take a look at the scissordatabase for known exploitedvulnerabilities in the wild over thepast few years there's a dozen of themdozens of them actuallythat existthat have been exploited and a lot ofcustomers are facing breaches todayand all of that essentially originatesbecause of the Legacy infrastructurefirst approachthat a lot of cloud providers around theindustry are taking todaywhat that means is your data ends upwith a malicious third-party actorand you don't know the location of yourdata anymoreso essentially if you're on a legacycloud providerwhat you're getting is not data locationit is a copy of data at a location ofyour choice with other copies floatingaround the world in laptops as youtravel mobile device notificationservers and malicious actors thatexploit vulnerabilitiesso reallythe question to ask when you think aboutdigital sovereignty is not just where isyour data locatedbut more importantlywho has access to your datathe reason that matters is if your datais located in one place but the wholeworld has access to it it's no longerSovereign no longer secure no longerprivateat Google workspace we're taking acompletely novel unique anddifferentiated approach to sovereigntywe're really thinking about digitalsovereignty much more holistically thanjust Road location of datawe do that by starting you offwith the extremely secure FoundationGoogle workspace is cloud native andzero trust out of the boxwhat do I mean by thatI meanwe were born in the cloudwe are not migrating over from Legacyinfrastructure routeswhat that allows us to do is ever sinceworkspace was startedwe ensure we authorize and authenticatewithout implicitly trusting any workloadthat is serving your email chat meetingdocument or file softwareit's zero trust built in not bolted onwe were doing zero trust well before itwas a cool thing for decades on endso you start off with that really secureFoundationand on top of that secure Foundation weoffer a powerful set of digitalsovereignty controls that we are callingSovereign controls for Google workspacewhich ensure that you are able toauthoritatively answer that key questionof who has access to your datathe other thing that we're doing withthis set of sovereign controls is we'reusing the same key set of controls tocomply with certifications for some ofthe most rigorous standards around theworldwhat that means is these set of controlshelp all our customers comply withvarious compliance regimes around theworld and the uniqueness lies in thefact that we have one single nativeplatformwe do not have a segregated golf cloudor a legacy infrastructurethe benefit of which is huge because asand when we comply with one regulationand the most rigorous standards of itall 10 million customers of workspacenaturally get that same level of rigorwithout having to actually do any otherbrand new installation change managementor migration over to a segregatedinfrastructureand these benefits benefits reallymanifest themselves when you think aboutthat secure Foundation that I spokeabout earlierbecause we're Cloud native we're browserfirstwhat that means is you don't need athick client to access Google workspacewhere full functionality in the browserdata ephemerally sits on your deviceonce you're done working you shut thebrowser down the device is wiped cleanthink about how much that reduces thesecurity risk Vector for all of youbecause even if the device iscompromised there's no data on itsecondly we offer a unique capabilitythat I'm going to dive into where weplace youas the sole owner of keys and what thatdoes is ensures that sensitive data isnot readable by phone notificationservers or by Foreign governments oreven by Google itselfand lastly you get a ton of securitygoodnessStraight Out of the Box because of ourzero trust routes and secure by Designand like I said zero trust built-inCloud infrastructurethe statistics speak for themselvescomparatively when you look at thescissor database we have zero knownexploited vulnerabilities over the pastthree odd yearsthat is a pretty impressive track recordall of you know how tough it is to hit azero on security and we're really proudof that we're going to continue workinghard to do thatspeaking of hard worka simple way in which all this workbenefits many of our customers withoutthem realizing is the notion of patchingof vulnerabilitieswhen there's an industry-widevulnerabilitywe do all the hard work to patch itourselves and we can do it on behalf ofour customersbecause we're Cloud nativewhat does that meanit means 10 million workspace customershave never had to install a single patchfor workspaceover a decade think about itwhat it translates to is workspacecustomers don't dread Tuesdays more thanMondaysit's a bit of an inside joke if you knowyou knownow on top of the secure Foundationwe build out a powerful set of digitalsovereignty controls that are across ourthree pillars of sovereigntythe first is data sovereignty what datasovereignty means is you can keep allcontrol over all residency and access toyour data we do this through dataregions and client-side encryptionthe second is operational sovereigntywhat this means is you have completevisibility and control over cloudprovider operations meaning Google'soperations on your data we do thisthrough three powerful access controlsand the third is software sovereigntywhat software sovereignty does for youisyou can work without a dependency onGoogleeven if Google is not able to serve youanymorebecause of a Black Swan event in therare occurrence of a black spawn eventand we do that by placing a copy of yourdata in country that you ownand that you can use for DisasterRecovery scenariosit is these holistic set of controlsthat we're calling Sovereign controlsfor Google workspaceI'm going to walk through each one ofthem one by one now and we're reallypleased to makefeature announcements today across allof these controls that we're launchingeither live already or coming in previewshortlylet's beginwith data regions with Sovereigncontrols you can regionalize your datadata regions already allows ourcustomers to store their data at rest ineither the us or EU the region of theirchoicetoday we're extremely proud to announcethat we're extending this capabilityto serve your Google workspaceapplications and process your covereddata in that same region of your choicewere already live in Alpha with a fewcustomers of some of them who you'regoing to hear fromand we're proud to announce that we'llbe in public preview by the end of thisyearand like you can see you can do all ofthis with a few clickson your administrative console withoutany scriptingwe do all the hard work behind thescenes for youand all of this is completely opaque toyour end users you don't need to gothrough the rigmarols of data moves andmigrations and suchit's business as usual for all of yourend users and your entire Workforcenow we recognize that there may becustomers that have more granular leadsaround location Beyond just the regionsof us and EUtoday we're proud to announcethat we are going to go to preview bythe end of the yearwith the in-country copy of data whereyou can move a copy of your workspacedata into a Google Cloud Storage bucketof your choice you can host it in any ofour regions clusters or mini clusterswhat this does is brings you to paritywith your legacy cloud provider rightawaybecause remember I said earlier whatyou're getting with them is a copy ofyour data in your countrynowwe're going to go one level deeper withgranularizationwe're going to give you the ability tostore your keys in an extremely gladgranular way in a key management serviceprovider of your choicewe're extremely proud today to announcea strategic key partnership with GlobalSecurity provider Talusand strategic key Partnerships withstorm shield and flowcraftwhat these allow you to do is store yourkeysin a specific region of your choice witha trusted partner of your choiceand it gets you way more granularthan a country because when you combinepowerful capabilities like context awareaccess of Google workspace which is amanifestation of our zero trustto our administratorswhen you combine context aware accesswith client-side encryption you can setvery powerful rules that localize you tothe ZIP code levelnowspeaking of client-side encryptionremember I said the key question toanswer for digital sovereignty is thenotion of who has access to your datawe answer that question authoritativelywith client-side encryptionthis is a unique technology that Googleworkspace is offeringwe are placing our customers as the soleowner of keyswhat that means is even Google or anyforeign government has no access to yourcontentyou become the Arbiter and the decisionmaker of all access by deciding who youaward the keys toand we're doing all of this in aseamless way in which it doesn't impactend user collaborationand to that endI'm really proud to make a series offeature enhancement announcements todayon client-side encryptionthe firstis we are going to enable all of you andyour end users to work on the go withsensitive datawe're doing that by bringing to Generalavailability mobile applications forclient-side encrypted Gmail calendar andmeetwhat this means is you can use nativeGoogle workspace applications in orderto communicate and collaborate with eachother in a client-side encrypted mannerthe second is we're enabling externalaccessfor guests to join your meetings in aclient-side encrypted fashion werecognize that you do business withseveral stakeholders vendors Partnerscustomers of yours we want to make thatinteraction and communication seamlesswhile being completely privatethe third and this one's my favorite iswe're going to enable the ability forall of your users to read respond andresolve comments in Google Documentswith client-side encryption turned on[Applause]now we recognize that this can bemind-bogglingly tough for a user werecognize that the weakest link in yoursovereignty and security posture is theend user sometimes and it happensbecause you're working on the go you'reabout to jump into that Subway that'sleaving it station you're trying to getthat email out as wellthat is a moment when a user may notremember to turn on client-sideencryptionso what we're bringing out in preview ina couple of months is the ability foradministrators to turn on client-sideencryption by defaultfor select organizational units orgroups of users that work on sensitivedata all the timewhat this means is you can set yourteams to work in client-side encryptedmode from the get go withouthaving to go through the mental burdenof remembering to do thatlastly we're also going to support otherfile types soon you'll be able to viewand edit Microsoft Excel files inpreviewall these together round out our set ofannouncements around client-sideencryption which I want to reiterategives you complete confidentiality overyour contentthis is as private as private getsfurthermore we're delivering onoperational sovereignty through accesscontrolsaccess controls allow you to control andView and get complete visibility overcloud provider operations which isGoogle support actions on your datawhenever you request Google supportwe start off with a solid base of accesstransparency which gives you powerfulreports around Google's access to yourdatawhenever we access your data we make itclear the reason why we've accessed itis typically because of support and wegive you your support ticket numberwith access management you can limitthat support to the right region whichcould be the us or the EU coming inpreview later this yearand with access approvalsyou can completely accept or re deny anysupport access requests to your datatoday we're proud to announceenhancements to access approvals thatallow you to revoke access that you mayhaveprovided and advocently as well asgranular access controls that Define thetime of accesswith a five-day period as an exampleall of this like you can see is doneeasily through our administrativecontrol through a few clicks with aseamless integration into our alertCenterwe're making huge strides in sovereigntyInnovation because we recognize theimportance of these controls to all ofyouwe made a promise on the Investments wewere going to make into Sovereigncontrols about a year and a half ago andlike you can see we've been deliveringand executing clinically against thatpromise with timely delivery andsometimes accelerated delivery of manyfeatures across the board that help youstrengthen your sovereignty posturenowwe're in the midst of a pretty profoundshiftto in Computing to generative Ai No talkat Google Cloud next would be completewithout speaking of generative AIand what we wanted to do hereis make a few commitments pretty clearto everybodyyour data is your data and that staystrue with duet AIthe reason I say this is Google has beena Pioneer in the space of artificialintelligence for many years on endworkspace has been leveraging artificialintelligence to deliver a lot ofcustomer goodnesswe have examples like document generatedsummaries in Docssmart compose that helps you writeemailsand grammar and spell check that hashelped many users correct grammarin their Google Documents all AIgenerated all AI driven features we havemillions of customers using them acrossthe board for many years on endthey've been using these features in ahighly secure private and compliantmannerall these features are certified at themost rigorous levels of certification sofarduet AI is no differentduet AI continues to respectall of your trust boundariesall of your security posture sovereigntyposture and your privacybecause like I've said your data is yourdataour commitment stays true with divide AIas wellin order to bring that to life let mewalk through the life of a querywith duot AIdo it AI resides within your databoundary like you can see when the userissues a request or a promptwe first use the usersdocuments and information to helpprovide context around the prompt whatthis means is we look for the documentsand the information that the user hasthe right access controls to it respectsall of the existing apples all of yourtrust rules and everything else when itpulls this informationthis is how we contextualize and providecustomization and personalization inDuet AI that's why you see demos likethe one we showed at our Keynotewith project symbol specifically servingup a deck that was extremely customizedto pet food and gen Z consumersduetai does not use your customer dataor prompts to train our modelswhat this means is you can essentiallyhave your cake and eat it tooit's not a trade-off between privacy andproviding helpful contextualizationand for all of the generated outputsduet AI completely respects all of yourexisting policies around data regionsaround data leakage prevention or dataloss prevention and any other securitycontrols that you have in placelastly but most importantlyunder no circumstances does duet AI letany of your organization's informationleak outside your trust boundaryall of this essentially means thatyou're getting a highly private secureand compliant experienceto leverage the best in generativeartificial intelligence through duet Aiand turbocharge your productivitywe're already working with severalregulatory bodies around the world tobring the greatest and latest incertifications to duet AIwith thatenough of me speaking about Googleproducts as a googlerlet me please join me in welcoming tostage three of our Marquee customerswe have eminent speakers from all threeof themgonna make a quick round ofintroductions to my far right is aspihawewala exec director at Verizon thenhave Sean bookham director at PWCand Liz Del Negro associate CIO at theUnited States General ServicesAdministration thank you very much forjoining us today making the timeI'm sure the audience will benefit a lotfrom hearing Rich perspectives from allof you on your respective Journeys whydon't we kick things off with uh youknow telling us a little bit about thenature of your organization's businesswhat maybe what a typical day looks likeand probably even a fun fact for theaudience okay I'll go first uh hieveryone first of all hope you're havinga great nextthank you for being here with us andspending this time we really appreciatehaving you hereum so I work for Verizon Telecom webuildum amazing networks and then we hang abunch of services off it so if you're aconsumer you can use your cell phone onit you can have fixed Home wirelessaccess as well where you can actuallyrun your home network off of 5G we alsobuild great experiences for businesseson those same networks as well so forexample if you were at the event lastnight and I hope some of you were wewould typicallyum set up 5G for those kind of events aswellso I work in the end user Computing andservices and support spaceso my day in the life is wake up in themorning think about what we can do forthe employees and go to bed at night andthink about what we can do for theemployees so obsessing about thatexperience is number one and thenum I have lots of fun facts about myselfthat I probably shouldn't talk about butmaybe what we can talk about is when Iwas growing up I really wanted to be oneof two things I wanted to either playcricket professionally and if you don'tknow what qriket is look it upum because it's a fun game or I wantedto be a comic book artist those were thetwo things I wanted to dobut then life gets in the way and in mycase it was just a consummate lack oftalent that got in the way I justcouldn't do it at the level that wasneeded so here I am talking to you I'mstill pretty luckythat's that's pretty amazing I speak alot of unrealized Dreams in cricketshared with you as well hi I'm Seanbookham UK operations and transformationdirector PWC PWC is a leadingProfessional Services firm been aroundfor 170 yearsum we have over 300 000 partners andstaff and we operate out of 152countriesum my role is a bit of a gentle and Hyderoll so on the one side operations I umtry to optimize the the running of PWCthe productivity of PWC and through theproductivity I have the collaboration ofall so I'm responsible for Googleworkspace across the PWC Networkand from a transformation perspective Ikind of try to disrupt the way you'reworking for PWC so find new ways ofworking looking at new technologieshow's that's going to influence and as abit of a side job I I also get involvedin creating new delivery centers so inthe last couple of years I've had theprivilege of working with the team tocreate a technology and InnovationCenter in in Cairo in Egypt and thisyear in South Africalike ask me I've got lots of um funfacts or probably weird facts but I'llleave a a very weird one with you I wasonce swallowed whole by a man-eatingplantwow that's going to be a tough one totopso that's a toughone especially since my since my fact isI'm actually not fun according to myhusband and kids at leastso but I'm Lucille NegreteI'm the associate chief ofChief at the general ServicesAdministration GSA is a federalgovernment agency and our agency is kindof behind the scenes so we run publicbuildings we actually also have majorcontracts acquisition we run FleetManagement and we also do technologytransformation and my role I run kind ofa suite of Enterprise tools SASSolutions as well as I support all ofour back office functions so HR Financemarketing legal my day-to-day is reallyfilled with meetings you know we'reconstantly trying to deliver for our youknow GSA programs and you know I can gofrom business cases to generally I'malways looking for funding I'll behonest with you but to continue the I.Tsupport so but my real fun fact actuallyis I do actually love cooking and myfavorite thing to do is to have peopleover six or eight people have dinnerparties I make them all sit around thedining table I am and I really enjoythat so that's amazing Liz like I alwayssay some of our harshest judges are athomeyou know and I think it's great that allof you have chosen workspace to drivedigital transformation across yourrespective organizations thank you forbeing long-standing customers of ourstell us a little bit about why you choseworkspace and how that's played out foryouTarget first okay um so pwc's had workspace for just over seven yearsum we we adopted it to fundamentallychange the way in which our our peopleworked we wanted make work easierprobably like a lot of organizationsfrom a collaboration perspective formany decades we've been relativelyclosedorganization so we shared information ona need to know basis and we we figuredif we could you know harness thatinformation if we could unlock thatinformation that was stored on harddrives and filing cabinets and people'sheads we could yeah better answer ourcustomers queries we could innovate withgreater agility and and success and lessduplicationum and uh yeah we we've been doing thatthe the other thing um and you mentionit in your your introum it was important for us to go with anorganization which had collaborationum built from from the groundum and and a cloud product you know froma security and various other bit speciesbut also from an innovation perspectivewe felt that you could innovate morequicklyum with that sort ofum architecture and we wanted to workwith an organization that was Keen todevelop quickly and that we couldinfluence that development and andthat's been working really wellso at GSA we were actually an earlyadopter of Googleum we in the 2010s were looking to moveto email our email to the cloud and wewere the First Federal agency toactually move our email to the cloud andwe're able really to adopt Googlebecause of the security posture alreadyso I would say thatworkspace has been well adopted at GSAand during the pandemic it played a hugeroleum you know we uh really I want to sayit was March 20th right the next day wewere all working from home GSA really isone of the few government agencies thatI'm aware of that was seamlessly able towork from home and the reallyinteresting thing to me you know sinceGoogle is cloud native we are you knowwe were able to see functionalityimprove pretty quickly I don't have thatwith otherSAS Solutions many of our Solutions havea separate gov cloud and so it can takea year for me to get functionalitythat's a commercially available but forum during the pandemic I mean we sawGoogle meet improve dramatically reallyover I would say over six months andthat's because of the cloud nativearchitecture that it's running and itwas really it was great to see and itreally actually made the you knowexperience of working from home a lotsmootherthat's fantastic I'll speak uh you knowour we obsessed about the employeeexperience so um and we really believethat happy employees equals happycustomers you've got to keep youremployees happy and it translates intohave really happy customers and by theway I forgot to mention this but if youare a customer of Verizon if you happento use it thank you we love having youon our Network and if you're notconsider giving us a chance and dosomething amazing for you but back tothe question so we've been very carefulabout building a digital landscape itisn't just about one set of tools butthe set of tools that really areintegrated Partners who can co-createand work with us very closely and whocan support us on the journey becauseas you might know it's not enough tojust deploy technology you really haveto help the employees and raise theirdigital dexterity over a period of timeotherwise nothing you deploy mattersbecause nobody uses it to the fullextent possible so be very carefullycrafted that journey and we also werevery cognizant of the fact that wereally wanted modern tools real-timecollaboration at the table and reallyuse the opportunity to show our usershow to work differently because if wedon't then they become they they're notreally as competitive as other employeesin the market and then as a company youlose your Edge over time so that wasvery top of mind for usso real-time collaboration is superimportant and those were some of thereasons why we made the choices we didand really built out that landscapethat's fully integrated co-creation withour partners and really enablesreal-time collaboration for everyonethat's amazing it's great to hear thatwe're driving digital culturaltransformation across all of yourorganizations I think what's interestingis all of you come from a varied set ofIndustry verticals and geographies andit's great to see that diversity hereand we have you know the suite ofsovereign controls so tell us a littlebit about you know how you implementyour sovereignty and compliance posturewith Google workspaceum soum digital sovereignty is actually notnew it's something we've been talkingabout for years um in the U.S we do nothave a gdpr like Europe does we havemultiple data protection acts you'veheard of HIPAA in my case I follow thefederal Information Security Act fismaand so our fisma data protection was inplace early on when we moved toGoogle so what Google has done for us Imean we have one cpanel right and we wemanage multiple domains and it makes itreally easy I think your comment aboutthe workspace vulnerabilities not havingany in the last three years has beenfantastic I also would say we have nothad an email breachwith workspace at all and I hope I'm notjinxing myself right now by saying thatum but I would say my ciso my chiefinformation security officer does reallyappreciate uh the security architecturearound Google and that just makes it uhyou know a lot easier for us toadministerthat's amazing that's really warmfeedback to hear and will work reallyhard so that you're not jinxing yourselfthank youyou know for us um the co-creationprocess has been really important withGoogle so we useum we we worked on data regions togetherand we were first movers on thatuh we worked on the short controlstogether we were first movers on that aswell we work with a lot of public sectorand private sector companies and we alsoprovide services to a in the private inthe public sector space quite a bit aswell so for us it's always reallyimportant to have that as the beginningof the journey and not at the end tothink about those controls so we use allof them and CSE has been really greatfor us too because we can add thatadditional layer of security wherenobody can see the data not even theGoogle administrator so it helps us meeta lot of export and compliance type ofcontrol requirements as well but what'sreally cool about it is it's built onthe same Cloud so we don't have to Pivotto a different cloud and it alwaysbothered me as an employee experiencedperson that if you were working deep inthe compliance and regulated space yourexperience was always a lot less betterthan the experience of a pure knowledgeworker because you had to Pivot to adifferent cloud and it was really toughit was really tough to manage what'snice about this is it's all on the samecloud and we are now bringing theexperience closer together so it youstill have to care for a few more thingsthan a general knowledge worker but yourexperience is so much better and thatreally gets me excited about havingeverything on one Cloud as opposed todifferent cloudsI love that love that it's not a harshtrade-off between compliance andInnovation yeah for you folks yeah andPWC is very similar to aspie you knowwe've been doing the diverse testingsand other species I guess we're slightlydifferent PWC we've as I said earlier wewe operate from 152 countries so we haveto comply with multiple sets ofRegulation often the regulationsoverlapping It's Gone In conflict witheach other Etc so we needed Sovereigntools and security tools which are veryflexible so we get that from from Googlein terms of what we use we heavily usedregionslike gaspi we use the assured controlsuh recently rolled out CSE for Gmailit's working really wellwe've been testing the data processingof regions and we continue to work veryclosely with you guys in terms of yourfuture developments in that roadmap soyeah it's greatthank you for being such a partner onthis journey such a great partner onthis journeyum and I think you know like I saidearlier we're in the midst of a profoundshift in Computing to generative Ai andlike you know we've made a lot ofannouncements around dual AI for Googleworkspace here at Cloud next I know thatall three of you have been kicking thetires and do an AI in your respectiveorganizations uh would love to hear alittle bit about how that's going whatrole do you see duet AI playing at yourrespective organizationsright well I love the question becausewe need to talk more about General Aviin this conference I'm pretty sureeverybody's Jenny eyed out but I'll tryto answer the question in the mostuseful way possible so we've beenkicking the tires on a number of usecases around generative AI in Myspacewhich is employee experience I see itkind of playing in two areas rightum one is the creation of content andthat's probably the more popular themore glitzy features that you've seen interms of help me write and other thingsuh in many different products I thinkthat creation process is going torequire a lot of learning and trainingfrom employees the other area is goingto be in the in the in this area ofconsuming information because all of usget overwhelmed by the amount ofinformation coming at us and Jane AI hasa really big role to play in helping youconsume information through transcriptsand summaries and asking cleverquestions of the AI that will help youfor example if you're out for two weeksand you've always had that email thatyou have to catch up onuh yeah I can help you there and I thinkthat's where I see a lot of Promise inour organization is helping ouremployees make the best of consuminginformation getting on top of what theyneed to know and then also helping withthe creation process as well so that'swhat I'm most excited aboutI love that framework of thinking aboutproductivity is creation and consumptionof thought and dual AI helping driveboth uh better and and making users morepowerful on both vectorsum for those of you who saw Sergelashappelle It's a Wonderfulpresentation yesterday surge talkedabout moments that matter in inproductivity so you talk about steamelectricity and computerization and nowgen Ai and when I kind of look back upin next year I've been working for 40years and during that time I've seen theintroduction of the PC I've seen theintroduction of productivity tools thespreadsheet Etc emailcollaboration more broadly smartphonesand so forth and each of those hashelped us make step changes in terms ofour ability to be more effective and soforth and gen eye is just going to takeus it is another moment that mattersthat's going to beincredibly excitingas we sit here today we know where someof those formative steps are going totake us and aspies referred to some ofthose we saw some insights in in theKeynotes in terms of where it's going totake us next but truth be told we don'tknow ultimately where it will take us soand that that's the really excitingthingum if I look from a security standpointand you mentioned it earlier one of ourour weakest links in security is a humanbeing because as human beings we makemistakesso I can see an important role for GenAI in helping automate some of thosemundane tasks that are mundane butimportant from a security buser to makesure we make fewer mistakes but yeah Ican't wait it's gonna be greatit's great to hear Lizso in my caseum we you know got a peek at duet AI acouple months ago and I immediately sawthe valueum I am in meetings all day and thosemeetings are pretty diverse I couldcover really a number of diverse topicswe have diverse customers and you knowwe'll be on uh Google meet and have areally rich conversation[Music]um but by the time sometimes you youknow from Google me to actually get itgetting it into the written word sinceit's not always the best result so I sawthe value right away I could seeum the ease of just even creating anemail from those um from those meetingsso we started looking at DeWitt Ai andof course you know when um Jen III uhwas really you know it explodedum GSA locked down all the toolsum as most government agencies did uhand you know you've probably have allseen the Congressional hearings that
