you're in theright place and if you're not you canleave you won't hurt my feelings I'llcry later but you'll never knowmy name is Valerie Harrison and I am aCloud engineer here at Google Cloudfirst off I want to welcome everyonethank you for being here both at nextand in this session I'm really excitedto be in front of you today and I hopewe'll learn something from each otherso I did uh just introduce myself andWhat My Title is and I don't know howmany of you know what a customerengineer does is does anybody know whata customer engineer is with Cloud one ortwo hands over there I like to joke thata customer engineer is the conscience ofthe sales teamwe want to make sure things are rightnow we are a s on the sales team we're atechnical resource we make sure that nomatter what you're consuming from uswhat you're building what Solutionsyou're implementing they're going to betechnically valid and they're going tohave the outcomes that you desireso that's great I mean that's my namethat's my title but really who am I andwhy am I here in front of you right nowwell I did not have a traditionaltechnical background I'll just say thatright now I was actually an archeologyand physical anthropology major incollegeI loved it it was a lot of fun I had agreat time I learned a lotbut as you can probably realize uh youknow maybe I thought I was going to bethe you know female Indiana Jones butarcheology is not all about running awayfrom a boulder and grabbing an artifactand taking it to a museum there's a lotof schooling that goes onthere's a lot of money for thatschooling and there's not always a jobat the end of it unfortunately it's verystrange to say it's just not a lot ofarchaeologists out there so I finishedmy undergrad degree and I bounced aroundfor a while I was underemployed Ipromise there's going to be a shortstory and it will be relevant I workedin libraries for a whileand in bookstores and I really likedworking in libraries but I didn't feelthat calling that passion to go intoLibrary sciencebut what I did find a passion forwas technology and I found it in a kindof an odd way I actually got onto onlinegamesbut I'm going to date myself herebecause I'm old enough that those onlinegames were text basedto anyone out here who remembersmulti-user dungeons muds yeahyeah sirs I see a few of you out thereand it was great it was a lot of fun butwhat really called to me wasn't the gameit was the interconnectedness of itI could be playing with someone acrossthe computer labacross the countryor maybe across the worldand this technology was bringing us alltogether to do this thing and so Ibecame fascinated with how it worked andI learned everything I couldI did end up going to some classes andget certified so that I could get a jobbut I dug in and I went througheverything I could find online and backthen there was no World Wide Web like itwas gopher and ways and I was readingonline books and things there but I gotmy foot in the door and I started at thevery bottom sort of the help deskthrough desk side support networkingdata center VP of it Ops before movinginto the tech sector and all of this isto saythat imposter syndrome is real with meit was very hard for me to speak up myearly days especially because I didn'tfeel like I had the chops to do it Ididn't feel like maybe people would takeme seriouslyand something else that was reallycommon is no matter where I was whetherit was in the classroom or in a meetingroomI did not see a lot of people who lookedlike me and who represented meand that made it even hardernow I want to turn it around and I wantto ask any of youhow many of you have been in a classor in a meeting room or even a cube farmand looked around and not seen peoplewho represent youthere's a lot of you out there a lot ofyouhow many of you are introvertsyay a lot of us introverts unite Aloneby ourselves in our rooms that's alsopart of the problem that's noteverything how many of you feel like youget interrupted when you're trying tomake a pointmany of youhow many of you feel likeyou have a hard time getting a word inedgewise even to begin withyeah a few of you sometimes it's veryhard to speakand I want to let you know that you'renot alonethis is going to be a very tactical talkabout strategies to help with thesedifficult situations and how to get yourvoice heardnow as you may know Dei is kind of underattack right now you've seen theheadlines you've read the stories andI'm not going to go into all the studiesthat find that organizations who aremore diverse actually do betterfinancially and creativity creativelyand so onif anyone is unfamiliar with them pleasehit me up on LinkedIn I would be happyto share thosebut the Supreme Court notwithstandingorganizations know the Dei is criticalfor their ability to innovate and thriveI feel very blessed to work for acompany Google who not only takes Deiseriously we have programs that we putin place we also measure those programsand the impact we report on themannually and we do this intersectionallywhich means we don't just report on howblack people are doing at the companyand white people women and men we sayhow are black women doing at our companyhow are Native American men doing howare Asian women and men doing and that'sreally importanta big part of Dei is attracting andretaining that talent and I in Dei iscritical to feel included in theorganization that you have valuethat you belong and that you deserve tobe heardand that's why we're here todaynow why does this matter and what arethe complicating factors to get therethe Journal of management studies foundthat a full 50 of all employees areafraid to speak up whether it's fear ofridicule fear of Retribution if you'reof asking a stupid question I I had a anemployer who told me you're not allowedto ask stupid questions I'm not sure whytalk aboutTerror but for underrepresented personsthis story is even worsein a 2010 study in the Jewel ofexperimental social psychology picturesof black women were least likely to berecognizedand statements by black women in a groupdiscussion were less likely to becorrectly attributed to themthan black men white women or white men2021 intersectional study by Mackenziefoundthat a full 30 percent of women feltlike they were interrupted at work andthat they had their judgment questionedin their area of expertiseand in another intersectional studyby Carnegie Mellon they found thatthree-quarters of female engineeringprofessionals and almost half ofengineering female students said thatthey'd experienced dominating teammatesand a lot of the women saying this isreally common at workanecdotally I have a colleague who hasbeen a leader in technology for a longtimebut he says he has a hard time beingheard and being taken seriously becauseof the color of his skin they don't seehim as a leaderso yes that's terrible but who caresright you know let's just do the worklet's just keep our heads down let'sstudy we'll get good grades do the workand let the work Shine for itselfand that's awesome but there's a fewreasons whythat's not the end of the storyfirst off you were hired for a reasonyou were accepted to your academicprogram for a reasonyour ideas have Merit and they havevalue and you want to get them out thereyou want to convince people there's thisgreat story in medium I wrote I readabout a female engineer who was in agroup meetingand she didn't speak up normally shedidn't but in her one-on-one with herboss afterward he said well what areyour thoughts what did you think aboutthis and she said well here I have madea bowl of the list of all the thingsthat I thought and how I think theproject should go and the boss was soexcited he literally jumped up out ofhis seat and said we need to get thewhole team back together and hear yourideas and so he did got them all backtogether she presented her ideas thatchanged the course of the project forthe better very important to be heardalso I hate self-promotion and I don'tknow if any of you hate self-promotionit's just awful I know I see you man Ihate it it just it feels so ingenuinebut it's so important it's so criticalfor getting those next opportunitieswhether it's the ability to uh get a newrole to get a promotionto lead a team or lead a projectthat's really criticaland last you know your ideas have valueyou should be heard you belong you'rehere for a reasonnow I'm sure some of you have heard thephrase if you can't be a good example bea horrible warningI am here as your horrible warningat the beginning of the pandemicmaybe we didn't all have the onlineetiquette that we do now and it was awhole bunch of people in a Brady Bunchset of squares and everyone's trying tocome off mute and say things and it waschaos and the way that I found to speakwas that I would start speaking louderand louder and faster and faster untileverybody else shut up I pulled thoseover everyone that was the last personstandingdid it workI mean kinda I was the last persontalkingwas it uh effectiveprobably not is extremely rude and itreally I didn't make any friendsso I did a lot of research and see whatsaw what the experts said were reallyeffective ways to get your word outthere without being rude or domineeringwe're going to talk about Generalstrategies at first and then we're goinginto specifics around in-person meetingsand virtual meetingsand first off I want to acknowledge thatit's not easyI agree it's hard getting yourself outthere but it's really importantand I also agree that it's not fairso many of us have worked so hard to geta foot in the door to get a seat at thetableand then we have another flaming hoop wehave to jump through to actually getheard and validatedbut I promise it's going to be worth itnot only for you and the opportunitiesit will give you but also for those inthe future hopefully we'll pave the wayso that others will not have to face thesame things we didI saw a great talk by Amanda Gorman whois the youngest U.S inaugural poetand she saysif I choose not to speak out of fearthen there's no one that my silence isstanding forso first offcall it outif you're being ignored if you're beingerupted call it out there's two ways youcan do that number one you can do itwith softenersI'm sorry I hadn't finished my thoughtsyetor I love that idea but let me keepgoing or I just think so soften it or goforwardyou can do it without softenersand my husband has this amazing story hehas an employee Anne who there's aparticular individual she's worked withthat tended to interrupt her a lot inevery single meeting and she found themost effective way was to sit put herhand out and say I am speaking I amspeaking I am speakinghad to do it four five six seven eighttimes before this person would stop andlet her talk but it worked even betterthis individual doesn't interrupt her inmeetings anymorethey realize that what they were doingand now they have a much better workingrelationshipa few years ago I went to someleadership training that changed my lifeI was the kind of person that if yousaid something rude to me if you ignoredme if you interrupted meI would take it really personally Iwould think well oh my gosh what have Idone or this person is terrible what'swrong with themand what I learned from this Managementtraining isjust because somebody does somethingthat offends you or bothers you itdoesn't mean they did it on purposemaybe they don't knowmaybe give them my opportunity to knowand thus I found a phrase that I livewith every dayand that is hanlon's Razornever attribute to malice that which canadequately be plain explained by wellthey say stupidity I'm going to bereally charitable and say ignorancemaybe they don't knowa dear friend of mine works with a manwho would interrupt her all the timeand it really bothered her and one dayshe finally had the opportunity to sithim down in personin privateand tell him you know during that budgetmeeting yesterdayyou interrupted me while I was trying tofinish my thoughtsI felt very disrespectedand I also feel likeit demeaned me in the eyes of myco-workersand you know what he didn't know he hadno idea he was so passionate he was sojust ready to jump in and help and dohis thing that he didn't know he wasbeing interrupting and he was beingoffensive and it led to a great innerexchange where they got to give eachother feedback on how to do bettersometimes you can give give people thegift of knowledgeanother thing you can do is prepare yourthoughts in advanceespecially if you're going into ameeting or a class where you know you'regoing to be have an opinion you're goingto have questions you're going to havethings you want to say you can writethese things down or just compose yourthoughts ahead of time this does acouple of things make sure you're readywhen the time for questions come it alsotakes the emotion out of it sometimeswe're very passionate or sometimes it'sscary to speak out this helps take thatemotion out of itbe persistent use all the strategies useany of them sometimes one strategy willwork better with one individual or in acertain situationkeep at it it's importantand you know that awkward silence thathappens when it's the end of the meetingor it's the middle of the class andthey say does anyone have any questionsor comments and suddenly everyone hasvapor lock like nobody wants to be thefirst one to speakthey're afraid or maybe they're afraidof being rude well jump right off a mutestand right up and say something youknow what you have a superpower youwrote your thoughts down in advancenext is what I'd like to call allyshipand amplificationallyship is finding an ally in a meetingthat can help you get your words outthat can help call on you if they noticethat you're not speaking I use my bossfor this sitting right thereI say hey you know there's a lot of bigPersonalities in the room can you makesure you look out for me and a few ofthe other members of the team who don'ttend to speak out or have a hard timegetting an award in edgewise and havehim call on us if we've been silentyou can also find a group of allies orwhat I call a squad I know a femalemanager and when she goes into importantmeetings she finds a couple people whoshe truststo be in that meeting and amplify herideas so that they get heard and theyget properly attributedso for example I say something andsomeone says hey did you hear whatValerie just said you know Valerie'sidea is great maybe we should follow upon thatthat's your squadand I want to challenge you to be anallyand to be a squad for other people aswellmake sure you Foster psychologicalsafety be a good leader of a meetinglook around and see if they're peoplewho haven't been speaking and call onthembe the squad for other people amplifytheir ideas both in personand in privatenow I'm going to turn this around I'mgoing to do the reverse UNO card I wouldI would have used a reversingo card butit's copyrightedare you part of the problemas you see even though I had a problem Iwas a part of the problem too I was thehorrible warningsome people speak to fill silence theydon't like that awkward silence I'veworked with so many sales reps andforgive me if there any sales reps herebut so many sales reps who ask acustomer question they put a proposal infront of them they say Ms customerhere's your proposal can I get you tosign it by the end of the weekbecause it's going to have all thesebusiness benefits and it's going to saveyou money and it's going to do greatthings for your company and they don'tactually let the customer answerembrace the awkward embrace the silenceand let people speaknotice if you're the only one Speaking Iknow that takes some self-awareness I'malways not the best at that Google meethas this really cool feature up in theupper left it actually has a littlepercentage marker that tells you howlong you've been speaking by percentagenow if this is a one-way flow ofinformation you're presenting an idea ora deck you know obviously that's goingto be skewedbut if you're in a 10 personcollaborative meeting and you'respeaking 75 percent of the time maybeit's time to step back and Seed thefloor to someone elsecome up for air occasionallyleave pauseswhere it's appropriate so people canjump in and tell their thoughtslastly feedback is a giftask people how you're doingare you fostering an inclusiveenvironment did you do good in thismeeting get some feedbackand make sure that you're open to itnext let's talk about in-person meetingsI know we still have those sometimesdon't wehas anyone heard of the Amy Cuddy Tedtalk about power posesthere's a couple hands out thereI'm a huge fan of this this has changedmy life and I know there's been someproblems with reproducibility of herresults so maybe it's just psychologicalbut I use my power poses it helps getthe endorphins going and it buildsconfidence if you're in the bathroomearlier you would have seen me do mypower pose you would have heard me do mybarbaric Opera silently of coursenow you don't necessarily have to do aPower pose in a meeting I mean you canyou do youit's totally up to you but you can standsometimes my hips hurt I like to standthe meeting anyway stand up who buildsconfidence that gets you noticedI know a lot of times conference roomsare Arctic and my default posture isthis because I'm freezing that's verysmallfill your spaceplant your feetstand up sit up straight maybe put yourarm on the back of the chairmake sure that you own the space thatyou're inand bring your whole selfyour seat can matter tooa lot of times you'll want to sit nextto the head of the table or next to theperson in power or near the personyou're trying to influenceso that you can be noticed I have afriend who gets to meetings early so shecan get the best seat in the housemake eye contact with everyone in theroomif you're the first one there as peoplecome in not and smile how you doingeven if you're the last one there makesure you make eye contact people willsee how involved you are they'll see howinvested you are and know that you'rethere and when you're speaking make sureyou maintain that eye contacta lot of us tend to I know I do thatmaintain that eye contact it's extremelypowerfulnow virtual meetings are a particularform of hell for meI think I shared my uh experiences atthe beginning of the pandemic it is veryvery hardin the cacophony of online to get yourmeeting get your words out there and toget people to pay attention to butthere's a few things that we found thatworknumber one use technology to youradvantage turn on your cameraI know nobody wants to see my postworkout bunbut if you have your camera on peoplewill see your motions as well as hearyour wordsI don't know if you remember JurassicPark when they were talking about howthe T-Rex was cued to see like Fastmotions and if you move slowlyhe would ignore youhuman beings are the same way squirrelthey see motion they're going to payattention to itI have a friend who has a pet peeve whenyour camera is here and your meetingwindow is hereand you're talking to the meeting windowand everyone's looking at the side ofyour headit happens a lot what he does is hedrags his meeting window up near thecameraso he's making more or less eye contactwith people and getting that investmentraise your handevery Major meeting technology has a wayto raise a hand I know I checkeda good leader will make sure that theycall on you or if there's multiplepeople you know you might go into aqueue and they'll call on you in orderif they don't call on you that's a greatopportunity to give them feedback afterthe meeting to do betterlastly you can use the chatit will get your idea out there you'llget your thought recordeda lot of times if you're recording themeeting the transcripts include the chatmessages as welland a lot of times the meeting leader orsomeone else will see what you you typedout and will say heywhat did you just say would you like toelaborate and gives you an opportunityto actually speakwe talked a lot about really tacticalthings that you can do and now let'stalk about the benefitsnumber one it's going to buildconfidence you're going to build thatmuscle memory of speaking and beinginvested and getting people to hear youand having your ideas out there andgetting that creditas human beings it feels really good tobe heard it feels validating we all wantto be heard with our ideas and ourthoughtsbut most important thing isthat you have valueyou're there for a reason and no matterwhat room you're inyou belongthank you"
