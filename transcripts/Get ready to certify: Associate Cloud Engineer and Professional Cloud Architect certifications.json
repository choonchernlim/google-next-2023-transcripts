you interested and pumped about uhuh Ace and PCA where uh we're both veryexcited to be able to talk about thisumhold onthere we go so my name is Carl FranklinI am the director of Enterprisearchitecture in Google cloud andProfessional Services don't be afraid itjust means that I like to talk aboutsome tough subjects and sort of try todesign things for customers and this ismy partner in crime today Wayne DavisI'll let him introduce himself heyeveryone and good afternoon and thankyou again for attending our next programthis week but my name is Wayne Davis I'man engineering leader in the Southeastand all that means is all of yourepresent our customer base and so wethank you for your business but I get achance to have my team talk to you on aregular basisforeignawesomeso we're going to cover a few topicstoday around certification we're goingto cover some understanding some rulesand differences we're going to talk alittle bit about the exam guides we'regoing to do some practice here don'tworry nobody's getting scored on theiranswers but we're going to try andactually walk through some questionswe're going to give you some tips andthen give you uh some what's next and achance to ask us some questions in caseyou have any questions or concerns thatmaybe we can answerand I don't think they notice Carl buton that same slide you were asked tostand up just to make sure we keep yourenergy High did you all see that on theslideokay good it's not there so great catchbut again we just really thank you allfor being here this afternoon thiscontent is not designed to scare you asCarl mentioned we really want to makesure that we are in the know with you sowe want to talk you through some bestpractices but more importantly we wantyou to focus on why Google cloud is soamazing and then why thesecertifications that Carl and I willdiscuss for the next 30 minutes or soare relevant for all of you so how'sthat sound to everyoneokay good awesome all right so we'llkeep it going here now when you thinkabout these certifications right GoogleCloud search they are some of the mostsought out in the industryall of us here in Google internally weneed to make sure that we are certifiedthere actually are some googlers here inthe room and they know the rigor that ittakes to be certified we also know thatall of you you need to allocate yourtime you want to make sure that you arereally focused in your efforts to do soand that's why this content hasrelevance for you as wellit doesn't matter if you are your veryfirst day in I.T or you have some tenurein the field we want all of you to becertified and that's why we're havingthis discussion today the last thing Ilove is that if you are thinking aboutstarting a brand new business maybe youdon't want to be involved in technologymaybe you have individuals on your teamyou have a contributor you have apartner and they are really excellent atbeing prepared and doing the tech thenwe can push that to you but as a leaderas an executive as an owner a CEO youstill can get certified so we have acert for you and that's what we want towalk you through here in the next slideor twothis one right here is an eye chart soplease disregard all of the visuals herebecause we're going to get into somemore detail but we have certificationsfrom the far left to the far right wehave a certification Lounge we're goingto talk about at the end but I love allof the search that Google presents tothe public today if you think about thecloud digital leader right the veryfirst cert you work your way over to theright with our associate Cloud engineerand then you look at all of theprofessional certs on the right againone of them is designed for you if notall of you so we want all of you to getall of the certs or if you can get oneof the search we still are feeling thesame as well so on the next slide we'regoing to dive into a little bit moredetail about each one of themnow what I love about the cloud digitalleader is that you may have started yourbusinessand you're super excited you need toknow just a little bit about GoogleCloudand then you want to pass it off to yourcolleagues your friends and then moreimportantly your Associates and then wecan dive into some of the details herewith regard to our certificationplatform the associate Cloud engineergets really sticky because now we'retransforming everyone we're getting fromthe theoretical and we are quicklyshifting into the practicaland then finally we go to the far rightof the spectrum here with all of theprofessional certs a lot of time can bespent on these certs and you're tryingto figure out which one is right for meif you are looking at your careersand you're thinking that there's no wayI could ever be an architect well I'mhere to prove you wrongyou can start anywhere along thisjourney and again all of them arerelevant to your industries yourcompanies and then also maybe yourpersonal tenuresone of the last things I love aboutagain all of these certifications isthat when you get to the end of thatJourney you're sitting in that exam andyou get that moment in your email thatyou passyou know that all of your hard work isrelevant and now you can put that hardwork to work in your jobs and yourcareers and then you can also search onthat new onesnext this is really good because you maybe curious about these certificationsand again right this is a nice littleeye chart but if you're thinking aboutbuildingif you're trying to figure out if I canreally deploy this in my day-to-day lifeyou've never even seen Google Cloudbefore everyone but now you have achance to start building on our Cloudconsole that's when the aha momentreally happensand then you start thinking well I cando this and then you can progress andthen as I've seen some of you at ourcertification Lounge we start talkingabout how you can move your careersforward and that's really what thedesign and the Epic pieces of thiscertification journey is all about it'syour personal Journeyso a quick show of hand right just tomake sure we have the blood flowing herein the room because I don't want to seeany head nods but how many of youalready have your certificationsawesome now just look around the roomreally quickly how many of you do nothave a Google Cloud certificationeverybody raise your hand so everybodyjust take a look at each other herethese are your friends these are yourcolleagues these are the ones that wereally wanted to motivate to make surethat we all get a small little piece ofthis pie how's that sound to everyonegood so finally you can meet all of thetechnical requirements and also thebusiness requirements as you startthinking about the professional exams wereally want to see how you think how youproblem solve and then how you take thisall the way to the end of that Journeywith a passing score at the examall right awesome I'm gonna walk usthrough a little bit of the rolls thatboth Ace and PCA has as Wayne introducedjust sort of deep diving a little bitmore into what are the differences inthese two uh exams which are some of ourcore exams and sort of what's thedifference and how you look at thosethings and try to determine which onemaybe makes more sense for you maybeboth make sense and we want to make surethat you also understand the differencesbetween the twoso the associate Cloud engineer iscertainly more of a execution type rolehow do you go about deploying a VM howdo you go about assigning security to ato a a role or a groupum how do you uh build up a deploymentpipeline how do you do a data pipelineEtc so the cloud engineer is very muchcovering a lot of the the sort ofactions that are required to deploy tothe cloud now when you compare that tothe professional Cloud architect thecloud architect is much more focusedaround the words design which is whichproducts do you use and why are youusing them in the combination that youare so while the ace is very much sortof a Hands-On the PCA is a little bitmore of a design process of trying to gothrough the steps of figuring out whichcapabilities you need in order to solvethe business requirements that you haveon handso one of the things we did here wasBard which is our ourour public chats uh llm access you knowhey Bard what's the difference here andwhile again it's a little bit of an eyechartum Bard basically gave the answer that Isort of offered before which is you knowthe ace focuses on the technical aspectsof the cloud PCA focuses on thearchitectural aspects of the cloud souma little bit interesting there to justsee if maybe what we were thinking wasalso lining up with what the llm had uhhad scraped off of various opportunitiesand this chart here it's a little bitsmaller again but it summarizes some ofthose details from Bard which is youknow the the aces of technical focus ithas a focus uh it has a depth that'swide so it's covering a lot of theplatform the difficulty is challengingin the sense that it still requires youto sort of understand a lot of differentcomponents on the platform but it isintended for people that are trying toget started in the cloud and trying tostart understanding how to deployinfrastructure how to deploy DataSolutions the PCA exam the printexcuse me the professional Cloud exam isa little bit more focused onarchitecturalit's a little bit narrower in focus inthe sense that it is focusing more moreon the role of architecting so certainaspects like deep dive on securitycertain deep diving on networkcomplexity deep diving on dataengineering those are all covered byother professional exams the architectexam itself is more of an overlay of howthe all of those things come togetherthe difficulties classified a little bitharder this is a little bit more of aprofessional exam we expect that youhave some experience on the platform andit is one of the requirements that wesay like we don't expect people thatlike take a training class toimmediately turn around and go from zeroto hero in say a week it really doesrequire some practical experience on theplatform and some use of the platformso looking at the exam guides in alittle bit deeper detail if you're notfamiliar with the exam guides the examguides are absolutely critical forunderstanding what we are trying to teston these exams they are public they areon the website they detail out all ofthe components for all of our differentcertifications from digital leader allthe way through the professionals andthese provide you the insights on wherewe're going to ask questions and thethings that we're we're trying to testforso the the big thing I think here that'sreally important is while you can see alot of training classes out there Googleoffers them there are Coursera onesassociated with Google there's some thatare independent there's pluralsightthere's third party trainers Etc whenyou're looking at doing certificationthe exam guide should always be thatroot of knowledge that you're pullingfrom of this is these are the thingsthat the certification team is going totest on the certification team providesthis exam guide not only to you but alsoto training people and then the trainingis developed based off of theirperception of what the exam guide iscovering so I really want to emphasizelooking at the exam guide and trying tounderstand what is there and what is notthere for each of our exams is prettyimportant we do periodically review theexam guides and try to refine them as wesee new roles come into the industry wemay take a certain piece of technologyand Fork it off into a new certificationwe may provide a revised exam guide ofremoving things from an existingcertification just to try and betterrefine the rolethe other big thing that I think isreally important for the professionalCloud architect in particular is thereare case studies on the exams they areshort reads it's several paragraphs weprovide the case study data ahead oftime so that you can read them and tryto understand the things that we'regoing to ask questions around withrespect to these case studiesso you will see questions around thesepublished case studies that we maintainthat data and then part of the exam willbe targeting those case studies for howdo you solve a particular problem in oneof these case studiesso let's practice a little and I'm goingto let Wayne jump in first on the acewe're going to take a look at a coupleof test questions hereokay so I'm extremely nervous right nowI need your helpthis is my very first question on theexam so as you take maybe 10 seconds orso just to read that question we'regoing to see if we can figure out whatthe answer is togethernow typically when we're looking at allof these exams these questions andyou're trying to deduce right which onemay be correct which one's incorrectyou're watching the timing there's a lotof moving pieces hereso by show of hands how many of youthink the answer is a for this one hereoh let's bring this up here so we'regoing to put that up here in a momentokay all right now now let's put this upthere so you've read the question andlet's pause for a moment and allow youto take a look at the answers so ifyou're considering answer eight it'stelling us to assign a basic role toeach user how many of you will go withthis as your answer answer aokay so the question says that we wantto make sure we focus on a couple ofthings we want to manage our firstcompany's development portal we want touse and configure something withidentity access managementsoanswer a any takersokay all right so let's eliminate answera all right fair enough let's look atanswer B create groups assign basicroles to each group and then assign theusers to each group how are you feelingabout answer Bthis is a tough crowd todayall right let's try this again whatabout answer D for Deltawhoa okayall right any takers for answer C forCharlieokay all right so we have a problem hereeveryone we're on the exam and we needto make a quick decision because theclock is ticking those seconds arewinding downso by show of hands again you think theanswer is D because it looks really coolthank you by the way back to raisingyour hand I appreciate that answer Dsays that we need to assign I ampredefined role why is this answerpossibly not the best answerokay so we heard up front because it's apredefined role versus a custom ruleokay and we need certain permissions soif we go back and pick answer C how manyof you are going to support me on answerCokay so yes the answer we want to focuson is when we create these groupsremember that we have a department wehave a group of individuals we haveusers this answer says we take a customrole we're going to make sure that welook in a sign all of those particularusers to that particular group now thisis important because imagine if all ofyou were to stand upand we need all of you to come up frontand check in and come and Shake Carl'shand shake my hand that's going to takea while rightbut what if I just ask everybody putyour hand up and give me a virtual highfiveokay man that was tough that makesthings a whole lot easier right so wecollectively just made our relationshipa lot faster because of what we didtogetherso when you look at these answers rightyou're really trying to figure out whichones make sense which ones are actuallyfocused on doing the right things andthen we're going to come to you in asecond and then we want to make surethat all of these answers look reallysuccinct so what I typically do is whenwe're looking at this question we wantto break this down into small bites andchunks and if you're looking here itsays you want to assign the appropriateroles that are required so in this casewe're looking at grouping and we'retaking individual users and then we'remarrying them together so that's why oursecret sauce is going to be within thatanswerand we're going to come to you in asecond here so bear with me the secondone here that Carl has this is a reallyinteresting question here now I want togive you a moment just to take a lookand read it it'll take you about 15seconds or so now pay careful attentionto what the question is asking for hereagain you're describing something andyou want to do something with snapshotsso imagine you have a machine you havesomething in time you want to take avirtual picture of it so you can storeit and then you want to be able torecall that so you got the question inmindokay all right let's see what theanswers are some choices hereso take 15 seconds again peruse throughthe answers and I need a volunteer tellme which one we can immediatelyeliminatein 10 seconds go for itB will eliminate okay because snapshotsis not part of a main group inside ofgcloud okay great so answer B is goneanother volunteer which one can weeliminateokay all right so C okay nobody likesgcloud compute snapshots getokay fine we'll eliminate C because thatparticular command remember we'relooking at the listing describing andmore importantly we're trying to deleteso okay answer C is gone fine I agreewith everyoneyou have two choices leftis it answer a or is it answer dooh did I hear answer aoh man okay so let's look at answer Dthis is a really tough crowd todayanswer D is saying gcloud compute listsnapshots why is that correct or notcorrectgive me your thoughts here and I'llrepeat it for the groupsyntax okay so you're supporting it'scorrect or not correctokay so we're saying that answer D iscorrect because of the syntax now acouple things snapshots are reallyimportant but it's also important thatwe have them in a subgroup and then thatsubgroup needs to be a part of somethingelse right which is how the commandstructure is actually put in place soyou'll find that on our platform syntaxmeans everything right how you put thosecommands in place but just for today youknow for the next couple of minutes youknow at 3 49 p.m on a Wednesday inCalifornia can we just pick the answercan we make it a todayis that okayanybody support me on answer ah thankyou because I was getting really nervousso when we look at this gcloud computesnapshots List look at the question hereagain it says you want tosay that a little bit louder up frontwe want to viewa description of the available snapshotsso this is why I love these because whenwe talk about I need to apply I need tostart I need to stop I need to view Ineed to change all these words are veryimportant descriptors in terms of whichanti you'll go with so in regard to thisquestion answer a is sufficient and itsuffices because we're trying to viewand then with regard to this we want tosee a complete listof the options for this particularquestion so these are some things Carl'sgoing to transition us into theprofessional cloud and again we're goingto take some questions at the endawesome so this is another little bitlonger one I'll give you a second totake a look at it but this is a cloudarchitect question again remember theace exam was more on the Practicalexecution side the PCA side is more onthe design sideso you can already see here that we'resort of asking the question in a littlebit of a fundamentally different way ofwhat is the best option hereand as you look at this you start to seesome of the components in here of thingsyou might want to think about you havedifferent tiers you have Network trafficthat needs to flow from one component toanotheryou may not want to allow flow fromcertain tiers to other tiers so thisshould start triggering even before wethink about it this should starttriggering ideas around features on theplatform that can maybe support thesecapabilities and when we look at thelist of answers here this is where westart to get you know sort of adescription of what are differentpotential ways that we can do thisand some of these make a lot of sense inon-prem and some of them maybe makesmake a great sense in on-prem and Cloudbut we have to remember Cloud networkingis a little bit different than on-premso some of these answers might be validin our our on-premises world which we'vebeen used to for a long time but in asoftware-defined network on in the cloudthey might not make quite as much senseso we can look at these answers here andwe can see all of these answers havesome level of validity butum following Wayne's example here cansomeone suggest one of these that mightnot make senseaso yes a is a is definitely one thatwould work in an on-prem world of maybedefining different sub networks but inthe cloud we try not to use subnetworksstrictly for security we're trying touse sub networks for a division ofworkload and things like that but notnecessarily as a security boundary so itdoes make sense to go a wouldpotentially work if we did some otherthings other than a but by itself that'sprobably not the answer we want in thecloudbouncing down the answers here if welook at B and we say well we could setup software-based firewalls onindividual VMS uh we have that featureon Google cloud of being able to put infirewall rules Etc that would allow usto do certain capabilities of likesaying hey the database tier can't talkto or can't receive traffic from the theweb tier and things like that but inreality that is often gonna that's oftengoing to create some challenges withmanagement because what happens if thesetiers are scaled with uh something likea a managed instance group now we havechallenges of how do we keep up with thefirewall rules and make them work whichgets us a little bit more into this theC and the D answers which is using tagsto help us identify which VMS have whichfirewall rules applied to them so tag Ctalks about routing tag d uh item Dtalks about tagging for firewall rulesso one of them is trying to do routebased the other one is trying to dofirewall basedum in theory both of these are prettyreasonable but you you generally don'twant to be trying to mess with therouting unless you have very particularreasons for why you want to Routetraffic certain ways again a securityreason isn't always the best reason todo this in Google Cloud so D winds upbecoming a lot easier answer to useNetwork tags to tag certain firewallrules and then have VMSinherit those rules based on which tagsthose VMS have so when I have a managedinstance group for my different tiers Iwill tell that managed instance group toassociate a tag with the differentfirewall rules that are required for itall right last question promise it is adiscussion about certification so wewanted to get into a little bit of thisand just sort of show you the differencehere's another question trying to lookat something like managingum a whole bunch of data coming in froma lot of different locations andthinking about the different productsand capabilities that might allow thisto happen so I will give you a second tosort of absorb the scenario there's somenumbers in here which might give yousome thoughts about like what might workwhat might not workthings like having a thousand meetingrooms probably something you don't wantto be doing a lot of manual steps for athousand times so you want to try andfigure out a way that you would be ableto automate that such that you're notdealing with the the size of some ofthese numbersand when we look at the solutions herewe have a couple of different types ofsolutions we have a solution that sortof talks about trying to have data dropto compute engine but it has an elementin it talking about persistentconnections and one of the things wecertainly know in cloud is relying onsomething to always be there is probablynot the best answer for a reliablesolution because you have Network packetloss you have hiccups Etc sosolution a doesn't sound great becauseit's sort of requiring a setup to besort of semi-permanently configured forhaving the data flowanswer C doesn't sound too badum basically having the devices go outand sort of periodically submit data toCloud SQLum part of the challenge here is thenmanaging the individual devices and sortof bundling up that data on a per devicebasis so we're asking the device to sortof do some work with its own windowinggetting it into Cloud SQL not a terriblethingum but as a PCA person as we've beenpracticing one of the things we learnabout Cloud SQL is there's a lot ofsecurity concerns and a lot of securityconfiguration with respect to trying toget authenticated connections to CloudSQL so you're going to have somesecurity challenges with B of trying tomake sure that you have all of thesedevices around the world properlyauthenticated and that someone isn'tmaybe trying to hook up a uh a 1001device that's uh sort of spamming intoyour system fake datauh I'm gonna jump C for the momentbecause I'm going to give you part ofthe cue here is that c tens one tends tobe a good answer for this one and when Ilook at D we again see that persistentconnection element the big differencehere is instead of using compute whichis a hard VM stuck in a particularmachine in a particular data centerwe've addressed it with app engine whereapp engine is this more flexiblestateless architecture that doesserverless compute so we've solved partof the problem in D that a had but westill have this persistent connectionelement which again can be fairlyunreliable so then that leads us back toquestion C which is leveraging a pub subthat the pub sub can receive the thedata and it can have this massiveflooded data coming inbound but itdoesn't require that that all getwritten to permanent storage immediatelybecause it's using a queuing mechanismwe can have whatever the velocity ofdata is come into Pub sub and we willprocess it as we need to so we've builtin a queuing system we've sort of dealtwith a little bit of the reliabilityelements here and we're looking now at adesign solution that maybe has higherresiliency than the other three choicesall right uh exam tips so I'm going tostart us out here and we're going tojump over to Wayne for a little bit ofthis soum we talked about some of these itemshere and hopefully uh addressing some ofthe questions here one of the things youvery much want to pay attention to iskeeping Pace you want to make sure youread the question in its entirety youheard Wayne very much focus on certainwords in the question will be sort oftriggers for certain ways of thinking atthe same time failing to read thequestion very precisely will lead you tomiss certain elements like maybe thequestion was asking for the most costeffective or the or the easiest to scalesolution missing those words can makeone of those other answers that winds upbeing wrong feel like it's more rightbecause you missed one of theconstraints in the solution and now it'svery difficult to do an either orbetween the twoum make sure you watch your timeum in my practice the theum the exam time is generally not anissue but it depends on how fast youread how fast you process we are tryingto give a a fair amount of time foreveryone but we also don't want to makethese tests literally like all afternoonor all morning so one of the things youwant to watch is if you're spending alot of time thinking and trying tomuddle through thingsthere is a capability within the examthing the exam experience to sort offlag the question to come back throughnext timefor a review so I would often recommendif you're spending more than two threefour minutes on a question just tag itfor later consideration get through morethe rest of the exam and then when youhave available time at the end ratherthan risking the whole exam on that oneblocked question and having unansweredquestions you're now just down towhatever you felt like you wanted tospend more time mom and then ideally youstill have enough time but you haven'truined your chance at all the rest ofthe questionscan we have a quick moment with everyonehave you taken an exam online beforeokay good and how many of you prefer totake an exam in personso if you do a quick shift right thiscan be down to down team for you rightit can be a task that is just likethrowing you off mentally you could bescared you could be nervous becauseyou're not used to the other format soit could mess you up but in number twoand three this is reallygood practices for you to follow a goodanswer does not mean it's the bestanswerso you could see some similarities inthe questions and then also the answersand then it could basically jolt yourmind to think that it could have beenapplicable to another one which why ifyou think about what Carl was sayingmarking answers and moving on is areally good practice but what I reallylove to do I take a look at the examguide I make sure that I comb throughall the little fine details and then Ifind the little hot links that I need inmy best practice for taking exams sothat I can be prepared for the examif you think about the answers rightlike how many of you prefer the morningtime over the night timeokay now how many of you prefer thenight time over the morning timenow I just asked to ask the samequestion but just in Reverse rightso at the end of the day it's perceptingand how we think about the exam how wethink about the question and then how weformulate answers but as you get yourreally good muscle memory in place rightfind a way that works best for you tostudy so again another quick show ofhands how many of you study best earlyin the morningand then how many of you study best whenthere's chaosyeah so I appreciate all of you as wellbut the idea is to find your groove whatmakes you get really sticky with thematerial and then allow it to beabsorbed into your mind so that you canpass that exam the exam guide is notmeant to trick any of you because Carland I we take the same exams you do butwe also want to make sure that whenyou're going through your again yourmuscle memory and getting the retentionand thinking about how stuff works youwant to find all of those things thatreally make the answer relevant to thequestionso that's why I started out and saidthat answer could be a good answerbut according to the question certainwords in there really will draw out thebest answer does that make sense toeveryone okay excellent so thank you somuch we'll continueall right so a little bit about bothexams you know sort of getting into someof the details here the length of theexams are both two hours long they aremultiple choice and multiple selectquestions so multiple choices choose oneof multiple selectors choose one welltwo or more the the question itself willtell you often how many to pick that'sanother really good tip of as you'relooking at a multiple select doublecheck that you you see it says choosetwo if you pick three you've alreadymissed the question so it's a reallysimple thing that I've I've screwed upseveral times of just trying tounderstand all of the data in thequestion that it's giving me that's sortof cueing me to where I should belooking and what I should be thinkingabout neither one of them have anyprerequisite requirements therecommended experience is for the aceexam to have six months of experience onGoogle cloud and the PCA is quoteunquote three plus years both of theseare really driven around industryexperience so we want you to haveexperience using uh virtualizationtechnology using uh storage systems thatareblock based file based object-based wewant you to have experience doingnetworking configuration throughsoftware because our our network is ansdn but very much those those guideitems are there to make sure that yousort of have a feeling that these arenot intended to necessarily be like thefirst thing you do out of college theyare intended to sort of validate skillsthat you've been building through yourprofessional career and that you're setup for success to be able to advanceyour careerand then of course building yourLearning Journey there's severaldifferent things that that Googleprovides to help you out we have uhdifferent courses there are thirdparties out there that also providecourses we love that there's a largerCommunity out here of things that youcan get access to there is on-demandlearningum I am a really big fan of Google Cloudskills boost Google Cloud skills boostis very much activity driven ofPerforming actions so it really alignssuper well to the ace exam of doingthings if you haven't done a GoogleCloud skills boost uh class uh online Ihighly recommend you trying it becausethings like learning how to deploykubernetes or learning how to set upbigquery and maybe use something likebigquery ml it's great for buildingspecific skill sets because it's guidingyou in how to perform those actions inthe consoleum and that gets to really that Hands-Onlab elementum the third one here which is is thethe power of that system is getting yourhands on the product it doesn't requirecredits for using Google Cloud skillsboost in the sense that you're gettingconsumption against Google Cloud theclass itself creates a test environmentwith a custom login and you get a periodof time to use that environment withouthaving to worry about uh personallyrunning up a bill or having yourcorporate account charged and then youmay forget to undeploy something and allof a sudden you're like well why did Iget a bill for 300 bucks oh it's thattest kubernetes cluster that I spun upand forgot to spin down Google Cloudskills boost handles that beautifully bygiving you an environment for a periodof time and then automaticallydisrupting that environmenton top of the Hands-On labs are skillbadges these are journeys that you candowith Google through the skills boostwebsite or the the skills boost platformit gives you a journey of sort ofestablishing a certain set of skillslike performing VM migrations orlearning how to do data pipelines andthen of course that last element here isthe process and the program of goingthrough certificationso one of the things you very much wantto focus on is sort of establishing withyourself making making yourself get acommitment to how can you get throughthe certification if you there are somepeople that are very much challengedwith the idea of well I'll take it whenit's convenient and then you know youlook at it two years later and it'snever been convenient some of the stuffthat I think is very helpful for us toget through certification exams isestablishing when you want to accomplishit establishing how much time how manyweeks of preparation work you want togive yourself how many hours in a givenweek do you want to make yourself committo being being engaged in this task andthen sort of what is the totalinvestment that you're looking at therefor trying to prepare this will oftenmanifest the the task at hand of tryingto get through the certification it'llgive you more commitment because you'veeffectively sort of built a mini projectplan of how you're going to get fromwhere you are to where you're going toget having that certification besuccessfulso uh along the same lines as the lastuh slide here it's also very importantto be practical and not try to overwhelmYourself by going you know what I'mgoing to cover everything in the nexttwo weeks like looking at these examguide gives you a logical breakdown on alot of different sections of the examthis can be used to maybe give you aweek by week or a few days by a few daysplan of what do I want to focus on andwhere do I where do I want to spend mytime that can help determine are therecourses are there skills boost uhskills boost Journeys that you can go onthat will help you be successful isthere documentation that makes sense totake a look at I can tell you from Wayneand I's perspective we have severalexams that we've completed but we stillhave to go through recertification everycouple years so one of the things we dois look at the exam guide and try tounderstand what's new in the exam guideand then what documentation has gottenadded to the formal docs about those newthings so it becomes a little bit of aDelta process in recertification ofgoing I've got the stuff that I passedlast time now what's new that I want tomake sure that I'm not gettingblindsided byand then of course like we just reviewedhere it's it winds up being superhelpfulum Google has published sample questionsfor both exams and it becomes reallyum helpful and calming to look throughsome of those questions which arepreviously retired questions for variousreasons so they're not used on livetests you're not going to get a freeanswer in the middle of it it would benice if we did but we don't but it givesyou a feel for what can you expect whenyou go into the the certificationprocess itself and you're sitting therestaring at the exam like what kinds ofquestions can I get how are theystructured that can happen through thesample questions to give you a betterfeel for what that experience can be soyou don't lock up and then you you knowyou look up and you've got like 10minutes
