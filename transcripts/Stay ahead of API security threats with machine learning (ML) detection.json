security I'm really excited to behere with youumlet's talk API securityso in today's digital world apis arebecoming one of the most attack frequentattack Vector out there and in thisslide you can see a few examples ofmedia headlinesthat um sorry media headlines around APIsecurity which are related to APIvulnerabilities you can see brand nameslike Tinder Peloton Uber and Optus themost recent one if you heard about ityou probably ask yourself why why areAPI security so popular these days wellapis are the front door for your digitalassets data and business logic so manyof our everyday life activity aresupported by apis if you register yourkid to school whether you check yourbank account balance or if you orderyour favorite coffee on your mobile appin this report businesses andEnterprises stated that there is agrowth rate of apis on an average of 201over the last 12 months so think howhard it is just to track all those apismake sure that they're secured bothexisting apis and the growing one thenew ones and also make sure that there'sno attack on your apisno breach or some malicious abuseso why is it so hard to protect apisfirst visibilitythere are many reports out there thatshow that more than half of theEnterprise's apis will be unmanaged inthe upcoming years if they are unmanagedyou probably cannot control or cannotput any security tools on top of themnext configuration so we did a surveywith Google cloud between businesses andEnterprises and we learned that thenumber one threat around API securitythat businesses are worried about is APIsecurity misconfigurationsnext costsecurity incidents in general can reallyharm your bottom line in this report anaverage cost of a breach was analyzed tobe around 4.35 million dollarsand lastly it's really hard to act andmitigate security incidents in the samesurvey we learned that 94 of the peoplesaid that they they believe they havethe right tools to protect from APIsecurity when 62 percent of them statedthat they experienced a security breachin the last 12 months so they might feelsecure but the data comes and showsotherwiselet's take a step backwards to those whoare not so familiar with apogeeso apigee's mission is to organize theworld's apis as being part of of Googlebasically it's a facade in front of yourapis and workloads wherever they resideit doesn't matter if they're on-prem inthe cloud multi-cloud deploymentsfor any use case that you've used you'reusing those apis it doesn't matter andmore importantly for any scale so itdoesn't matter if you have only hundredsof API calls per day or you havemillions of API calls per day you'll getthe same level of serviceon top of that we provide stronganalytics toothose analytics come to help the useroperate govern monetize and secure thoseapisand lastly on the platform we're tryingto answer the needs of developersleaders and security peopleso the advantages of using Advanced APIsecurity is that we are part of apigeeplatform and already existing strongplatform to govern your apis we are ableto help you manage the entire lifecycles of their apis and we're alsointegrated into the gcp ecosystem withIntegrations into many security productsfor example you have here on the slidemendiant Asm on top of that we providemany security features like riskassessment abuse detections reportsalertsum and depth recommendations and bestpractices and many more and I'll talkabout it a nowso apogees has two maincomponents the control plane and theruntimeAdvanced API security is part of thecontrol plane as such we have visibilityto the entire life cycles of your apiswe also have visibility into theenvironment how your apigee environmentsare configured and how your API proxiesare configured and we can compare it andprovide recommendation on top of thataccording to best practicessecondly we we have visibility into analready existing analytics data so wecan run abuse detection algorithms andand logic in order to find any abusewhich is happening on your API trafficin real timeand lastly we integrate it into theruntime in order to act in real time toany suspicious or malicious activitywhich is found on on apogeeso what does it mean to have an APIsecurity programfirst of all you need to get to makeevery API visible right you cannotcontrol you cannot protect what youcannot see you need to eliminate anyblind spot on your digital environmentsaround apis you need to discover all ofthem both external and internal apis onany wherever they reside on multi-clouddeploymentsyou need to consolidate them into a hubinto a catalog in order to manage theirlife cyclenext once you've found all your apis andyou're sure you don't have any blindspot you need to make sure that you havea consistent standards of securityacross all those apis existing apis andof course a future upcoming apis youneed to make sure that you can assessthe risk for each API and if somethingis misconfigured you want to be able totake action on it in the platform inorder to get it back to be with a strongsecurity postureso after you found on your apis you makesure that all the security policies arein place for that you need to make surethat a you can detect any abuse which ishappening on your apis if your API isexperiencing some abnormal traffic orsome abnormal activity you need to beable to to identify itand it identify it understand it quicklyin order to act on itso if you found some suspicious activityyou want the system to be able to act onit maybe flag some suspicious activitymaybe redirect the traffic maybe youwant to deny the traffic so actuallywithin the platform you want to be ableto act on itso let's take a look how we can help thecan how we can help you get morevisibility into your API landscapeso the idea here is where you're goingto utilize Mandy and ASM mainly andattack surface managementhas more than 250 built-in integratorsin order to identify any external facingassets when I say assets I I meanvirtual machines host names IPS openports and of course openapis public facing apis it also adds alot of information on top of thosefindings in order to help you understandwhat they are like severity or activecheckswhat we do is we take all those API thatMandy and ASM found and we push it intoa API hubso think of API Hub as a universalcatalog of all your apis again doesn'tmatter where they reside whether theyare hosted on apigee on other APImanagement platform in public cloudsdoesn't matter where they are everythingis is streamed into the API humthe basic idea behind the Hub is toempower Empower your developers to reuseexisting apis instead of creating theirown on each timeand API Hub helps manage the the APIlife cycle so from design from designplanning pre-production production untilend of life with all the informationaround thatso okay so now we we were able to findall those API consolidate them into anAPI Hub now you should be able youshould make sure you can have ensureconsistent security standards on top ofthem and that's what we're coming inwith this feature so the idea here is tohelp the user adhere all their APIproxies to security standards bothinternal and external in order to avoidany misconfigured apis that might leadto data leaksthe system evaluates each API proxy andenvironments is how it's defined andalso as scores it and also gives therecommended actions of what should beput in place what policies what securitypolicies you should put it place inorder to improve your security postureas much as I like those dashboards and Ithink they're pretty I don't expect youto actually sit in front of thedashboard and so we are also connectedit to Cloud monitoring Cloud monitoringenables the user to get notifications ifsomething is happening in yourenvironment so let's say that you havean API proxy a payment proxy a highlysensitive and you want to make sure thatif something changes on thatconfiguration you a you're going to getan email or a slack notification that'swhat you can do here you can definethose kind of alerts to let you know ifsomething is misconfigured you can jumpinto the product and get understandingget recommended actions and fix itthis this is also connected to Pub subso you can push all this informationinto Pub sub for example if you want toconnect it to any ticketing system thatyou might haveand everything that you see here isaccessible or through also through APIso you also can access it that wayokay so let's see a short demo aaround thatso what you see here you see my mysecurity scores in apigee in apogeeenvironment you see all myenvironments where their risk level withthe security his score and you see thenumber of recommended actions for eachfor each environmentnow we what we we can do is jump intothe specific environment let's look atthe local environment first of all youcan see the top highlights for eachassessment so we have three types ofAssessments as part of the score Sourceproxy and Target each one is focused onanotherum another set of assessments so forexample the proxy looks at how the proxyis assessed sorry which policies theproxy holds you can see they were in thedistributions of the of the API proxiesunder the specific environment accordingto the risk level so you can also seethatand now you can also jump into theassessment page to get more details sofirst of all you can get details of theassessment what exactly was evaluatedbut more importantly you can get a listof all your API proxies in a dedicatedrisk level and score for each proxy withthe recommended action so for examplethis test one proxy has authorizationa authorization recommendation whichmeans that the system suggests thatyou'll add one of the following policiesin order to improve your securityposturethat's what I thought would happen okayOkay sonow that you found all your apis youmade sure that everything is configuredcorrectly you have all the Securitiespolicies on top of them you want to makesure that everything is operatingsecurely in runtime so it make you wantto be able to identify any abuse orbusiness logic attacks or attacks thatFocus to extract data from your apisfor that I'm really excited to tell youabout the new machine learning modelsthat were recently released these modelsare aGoogle owned models were trained andmaintained and supported by Google toidentify specifically scraping attacksand anomaliesand so this is again this is the way forGoogle to share the security and machinelearning know-how and bring it to thehands of the customers now we also addedin product close to real-time dashboardsin order to show the attack landscapeand only today I talked with thecustomer who told me that securitypeople likes like like dashboards so wehave also dashboards here andwe we also added clustering algorithm ontwo those dashboards in order to Clusterthe detected traffic in order to or inorder to reduce the the amount oftraffic detected in order to help theuser focus on the most sensitive andcritical incidents and we also added alot of context for each incident that wefind and for example we enriched todaythe traffic we're playing to Universityeven more with threat intelligenceinformation so the whole idea here is tohelp the user with them in a matter ofsecondsto actually understand if there is asecurity incident if it needs theirattention if they need maybe to involveother people in in the in this incidentokay so all the detected traffic that wethe rules that we just saw everything issupported by a strong reportingcapabilities so you can customize createany reports you want in order to show tosee what was detected by the trafficagain everything is accessible throughapis and you can alsoum get the information from the apis andstream it to any Sim that if you'reworking to create your own dashboardsand to correlate it with also othersecurity products that you might haveokay so now that we we had we have morevisibility into the uh to the trafficpatterns on the apis and in apigee nowwhat we want to do is if we find somesuspicious activity we want to be ableto act on it and again this is one ofthe advantages of advanced API securitybecause we're part of a API of apigee ofthe API management platform we're ableto integrate into the runtime in areally efficient way with minimallatency impact on the on the runtime inorder to actually take action on thetrafficso what we offer here is the user willbe able to act on suspicious trafficwhether it's toum flag it for Downstreamworkloads or flag it to in order tocorrelate it with othersin your sim with other a alerts securityalerts that you might have you'll beable to deny traffic if you decide thatit's malicious you you are able toredirect the traffic and everythingwithin the apigee platformso I guess we have a demo for thatI'm sorry I don't have a demo to show anattack I promise you next next I'll dothat I'll just have a demo that willshow you how uh the the policy is beingconfigured in in apogeeso here you can see I'm going to createa new action I'm going going to call itnext demowhat I want to do is I want to deny thetraffic for a from everything that wasdetected as the um ml scraping by the MSscraping modelI'm going to apply it on my environmentdefault test I'll set the expirationthat way it will never expireand now I'm going to choose the actionthat I want to use so there are a youcould see allow deny or flag you can seehere that I'm using with flag we'readding a header name and a header valueso you can add this header to thedetected traffic in order to you knowmaybe do with it something with thisinformation in your Downstream workloadsoh no I thought I didn't want to happenokaysorry for thatokay hereso this is flag but no I want to denythe traffic from the MS scraper so I'mgoing to choose thatnow I'm going to choose a predefinedmessage to the client that was deniedyou can choose I'll choose 404 just tohide the the reason that I wouldrejected the request I can choose theset of conditions so it's currently it'sIPS and detected rulesum I'll choose the new Advanced APIscraper I can also you see create otherconditions in order to have a more itsensitive and tuned rulenow I'm going to create I created itthat's great I can see it in my list ofrulesum and now I'll see that it the ruleexists here it will see also that it'senabled of course we can disable it ifwe want we also added a dashboard toshow the uh the action itself so here weget more information about the actionbut we'll also we can also look at thetraffic of the action of the how thetraffic was impacted in the last twoweeks of course nothing was detected anddenied because we just created theaction but basically you'll be also beable to see any traffic that was actedon with this with this new policyokaygreat so umto sum it up basically in apigee webelieve in shiftshifts left and shift down shift leftaims to help the a to help scalesecurity peopleright you see I talked with manycustomers they taught me that tell methat security teams are pretty smallthey need to scale they need to bringmore tools into the hands of the APIdevelopers and API API management ownersso we are trying to do that and with alot of security configuration automationaround that alerting notificationeverything in order to bring more toolsinto the hands of the API owners aroundsecurity and shift down we mean that weactually want to put everything morepush it towards the platformthat the platform will serve you that itwill detect things automatically withdetect enemies configuration or anyabuse we let you know we'll also giveyou the recommended actions what youneed to do in order to improve yoursecurity posture and and get back inline to a strong a strong API securityposturehey thank you very much for joining metoday and it was a pleasure for me ifyou have any questions I'm here afterthe presentation[Music]foreign"
