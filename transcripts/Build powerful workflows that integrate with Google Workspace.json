    "transcript": "foreign[Music]T I'm the product lead for the workspaceplatform and ecosystemI realize I'm standing up here it's beenlike four years since I stood up onstage not in front of a tiny screen soit's great to have an audience againI'll be joined later by my peers andcolleagues Ava and Genevieveuh you're probably aware workspace'smission is to meaningfully connectpeople so they can create build and growtogetherand today what you want to do is spendsome time talking about the workspaceplatform and how it will help you createand build things and really andespecially help you use AI tosupercharge and superpower how peopleworkwe'll start with the vision talk alittle bit more about how we see theplatform where we see it going dive intosome aspects of workflows of course I'llbe sure to touch on some of the newcapabilities that we've launchedrecently or launching soon and thenwe're really excited that we have ourpartner lassian here to come up on stageand talk with you all and give aperspective on how they see theecosystem surrounding workspace and thepartner experience and how that reallybenefits our end users and Jointcustomersso let's Jump Right InI probably don't have to tell you someof these numbers especially that firstone workspace is the most popularproductivity tool in the world with over3 billion users that's a really hugemarket for folks who are developingsolutions for workspacebut a lesser-known number and props onethat's actually more important if you'rebuilding for workspace and looking foran audience is 10 million payingcustomers those are businesses of allsides ranging from a very small businesslike maybe your local florist all theway up to some of the largestcorporations in the world and these arepaying customers who are looking forSolutions not just from Google not justfrom workspace but for our partners aswell so it's really a huge opportunitythere for partners who are buildingthings on top of workspacenow we see the manifestation of that inour marketplace where there's been over5 billion downloads of apps and add-onsout of our Marketplace this allowsobviously end users to extend thecapabilities of our platform even moreand gain the benefit of the things thatdevelopers are building on top of ourplatformso clearly developers have a hugeopportunity and a huge way to achievesome success on on workspace through thesize of the audience but that's noteverything we also have a very extensiveplatform of with a lot of rest apis andfoundational elements underpinning theplatformbut more importantly than that ourplatform is built upon safety and Trustat its coreand that's secure by Design it's notbolt on or think about afterwards whenour team sits down we're designing a newAPI a new feature we foundationallythink about how that will be secure andsecurity means a number of things withour folks from an end users or acustomer's perspective they want to havetransparency in terms of how data isbeing used how it's going to be usedwhat access any type of application hasto that data and from the perspective ofa developer you also want to make surethat it's powerful and yet relativelyeasy to integrate into and so my teamspends a lot of time on an everydaybasis really think about how toreconcile those two things how do wemake sure the platform is very securewell they also making sure it's easy toaccess for users and easy to use forDevelopersnow as we've all seen generative AI is aGreat Leap Forward for AI and we'rereally excited to help you plug in andbring the power of AI to workspace andto our joint customers but AI isn't newto us we've been building features withAI for yearsand building features the AI safely andcorrectly requires a lot of deepexpertiseand so that's one of the reasons we popup this slide repeatedly is to you knowit feels like Nai is a moment thathappened in the last six months butreally workspace and Google have beenworking on this area for close to adecade and so in many ways though we'rereally just getting startednowthis morning you may have heard fromaparna in the keynote a number of newgenerative AI features things likeassistant writing ways of helping endusers be more productive inside ofworkspacefirst manifestation that we see of AIand workflows and workspace it's helpingusers within our first party app soGmail docs sheets and slides meet but wewant to go beyond that especially whenwe're talking about a platform so theplace where we go next is how do weenable single or simple workflows totranscend Beyond just our first partyapps into second party like developercustomer internal apps and intothird-party applications and so you'llsee some things here today as well asthings coming up in the in the futureliterature vision of how we can allowDuets to interact with third-partyactions and third-party data andincorporate that in order to provideeven better responses so for example anassistant writing case how can duet takeadvantage of not only information fromworkspace but other information that thecustomer has in order to help you writeeven betterin the long run where this leads is theability for AI to run complex multi-stepworkflows those are workflows where youmight move back and forth beingworkspace app and a third-party app andmaybe a system internal tool repeatedlyyou could probably describe that work ina couple sentences it's complex to carryout but relatively simple for you todescribeso in the long run we are trying to getto a point where you can describe thatand have a platform where third-partyapps customer internal apps all can beintegrated into that single platform andthen allow the user to interact with asingle thing to execute tasks across allthose piecesnow that all sounds pretty fantastic butlet me draw back a little bit toworkflows and where we are today becausea lot of things you can do today withworkflows and so I'd like to walk youthrough a scenario and walk you throughsome of the examples of things which youcan do end users can do today using someof our partnersand so to help us walk through thislet's use a a sample person this personsymbol is not a real company just forfor folks who are concerned uh this is asample Persona uh so let's imagine Chrisis an engineering manager at a companycalled the symbol uh and as it turns outuh Chris and his team have been asked tobuild a new mobile application and theyuse numerous apps when they are workingspanning Google workspace but they alsohave specialized apps for visual designtask and Bug tracking they have an IDEthey have code repos they have to debugissues and you know as much as we mightall like to focus on building mobileapps we also have to update leadershipwe have to you know communicate withoutside teams there's a lot of differentthings that we have to do for building amobile app and these involve a lot ofdifferent applications along the wayso let's look at some of the things thatChris might have to do he's got tocreate a plan set up some task trackinghe has to schedule some time with histeam this is a like like most of us areliving as a hybrid team in the officesome days not in the office other daysbut they have to meet up and brainstormand and create some mocks uh he's got toremember to update his leadership andshare project details so let's walkthrough each one of these and see howthat's enabled by some of the partnersthat are in our ecosystemso to First Connect his team and get histeam set up he's going to start inShort's going to start in chat he'sgoing to connect and create a uh a newjira project right from within Googlechat Google chat is going to be theplace where Chris and his team arediscussing issues and con and Conceptsso that's the foundational place ofdoing a lot of their communication andso he's going to set up that projectright from within the chatthen he wants to set up that meeting asI mentioned it's a hybrid workplacepeople are in the office differentoffices at different times our partnercomane has created a great add-on thatwill allow Chris to figure out who is inwhat office book the appropriate sizedmeeting room because you know there maybe seven people who claim they're in theToronto who live in Toronto but onlythree were actually coming to the officethat day and no one likes when youreserve a meeting room that's like waytoo big for the set of people are comingin that's definitely a problem at GoogleI'm not sure what uh about other folksComey really helps Chris solve thatproblem and so Chris is now able toschedule a meeting get the rightconference room and have it fit for thepeople who are physically present at thetimenow in that meeting obviously they'regoing to be using Google meet some folkswill be live in person some folks willbe online but they want to do Dynamicdesign and so what this team is going todo is they're going to look at theirmocks and figma and they're going to dothat directly within meat using figmentsmeat add-on so directly within meatthat's an interactive view of figma theentire team can interactively work ontheir designs and collaborate rightthere so next best thing to being therein personnow finally as I mentioned we're gonnahave to update update leadership andwe're going to use one of the featuresthat we heard this morning from partnerwe use a AI assistant writing in Docsand as part of that we're going to addsome third-party smart shifts Imentioned that we were using figma fordesign and jira for task tracking soChris is able to add smart ships thatlink out to the figma project that linkout or sorry Sigma design and Link outto the the jira project and these smartchips have inline previews so whensomeone opens up that document isreading it they are presented with 17links they have to click through it tosee what's what's interesting each oneof them they can see an immediatepreview in line and decide if they needto go through and see the fullexperience or the preview was wassufficientso it's a pretty productive day for uhChris and his team and even moreproductive because they took advantageof all the Partnerships that uhworkspace has toenhance their experienceso with that I'd now like to invite Avaand Genevieve up to the stage to walkyou through atlassian's partnership withthe workspace and see how we're workingtogether to make our users life moreproductive[Applause]yeahhi everyone I'm Ava Mala and I leadGlobal Partnerships for workspaceGoogle's productivity Suite I amthrilled today to welcome GenevieveShihanVP for product at Confluence atlassianGenevieve it is so great to have youhere todayI would love to start by asking you foryour perspective on the needs of amodernknowledge worker in particular what aresome of the partnership like ours how dothe how does it fit in that how whatrole does it play in thatyeah thank you so much Ava for having mehere and Matt for starting us off withshowing the power that we're bringinginto a Google workspace and with ourIntegrationssothe issue that modern knowledge workershave is not too different than theproblems that all of us face how do weget our work done get it done right andget it done with our teambutthe challenge that we have is digitaltools make that easier but it isn't asseamless and easy as it could beand part of the issue there is actuallythe tools we spend a lot of time lookingfor the right work moving betweeninformation and just searching for theright stuff to get our work doneI know if I think about my last workingday I'm using a dozen apps to juggleback and forth between the right placesand right information and it isn't justanecdotalHarvard Business Review has done a studythat says that there's four hours oflost productivity for every personinside every single week and if youscale that across the entire year thatmeans that five working weeks of my weekor your week your your my year isactually wasted just switching betweenapps and figuring out how to get back tothe right contextso the challenge for those knowledgeworkers is making sure they can find theright information at the right time andthat's how working together as Googleand atlassian and other leaders in thefield we make sure that we prioritize adiverse app ecosystem what that reallymeans is when we build tools we don'tjust let them exist in silos we buildways for them to work closely togetherso that for the end user you have aseamless experience rather than havingto always juggleat atlassian we're built on a platformthat's open by Design and this givesteams the freedom to use the tools thatthey want and need to find those rightpieces of work but also integrate thatwith all of their other favorite toolslike stuff that Google has builtI couldn't agree with you more aboutswitching contexts and apps I mean evento accomplish a simple task like filingfor a vacation we have to switch betweenso many apps todayso Genevieve what are some of the userbenefits of the integration betweenatlassian products and workspace yeah sofor in Google as Matt said manycustomers rely on Google tools andespecially Google workspace as theirprimary productivity Suite the placethat they might start or end their dayor a lot is tying a lot of their worktogetherbut the workflows that people haveextend across multiple of our platformsso by bringing atlassian and Googleworkspace tools closer together thatgives end users a seamless productexperience so let's give an exampleMatt talked about an example of peoplehaving a meeting in meet but here'sanother place that we've built togetherto allow the atlassian platform to workdirectly with Google meet so herewithout leaving Google meet if I'm in ameeting with multiple of my co-workers Ican open that Confluence page and notonly present the content but actuallyhave everyone in that meeting who needsto be co-editing or doing work doingthat right inside the Google meet frameand that's part of the power ofintegration is you can do the work youneed to do right from the tool you'reactive in with other work there and eventhough this seems like a small tweakthis goes so far beyond I've clicked abutton to share my screenfor me every time I join a virtualmeeting and I work remotely I'm togglingall of these apps I've got one windowhere I'm switching the video so that Ican put the work that I need to editwhile people are talking and it justbecomes a mess it's so hard to keeptrack of but with this meet integrationwith the Confluence Page live I can seethe people I need to see and have thatconversation still inside the meet frameand we're all doing the work andcontributing together so no moretoggling tabs no more figuring out whereyou update and this is coming livealmost immediatelythat sounds awesomeI'm sure top of mind for audiences whatare some of the Integrations otherIntegrations that we're working on socould we please walk them through thatyeah and if you weren't paying attentionwith Matt I'm happy to highlight thoseagain uh you know another place thatwe've done a lot of integration ismaking sure that the right content is inthe right place so atlassian was one ofthe first Partners to support Googlesmart chips that lets you preview andunfurl the content you need right frominside your Google Documents so today ifI have a Confluence document or a jiraproject link I can see that straightinside Google Docs and understand what'sthere so users can click Quinn quicklyclick to see their project status or thepage details and we have parallelfunctionality in our atlassian platformsuch that atlassian smart links unfurlGoogle Docs sheets and slides so you cansee either just the correct title or afully unfurled preview so that whereveryou are inside that tool you have theright information from the other Suiteand right now this is in docs but wealso plan to bring it to sheets andslides soonnow another favorite integration thatMatt covered is jira in Google Chat soif you're right inside a chat you'rediscussing what you want to do and let'sstart this feature just from one commandyou can open up a new jira issue andthis is again keeping people withoutlosing context in the flow of their workusing all the right toolsthese Integrations sound great and Ican't wait for these all to launch andhave the experienced by our mutualcustomers and usersSwitching gears a little bit given AI issuch topic to Doorwe'd love to hear your perspective on AIand its ability to supercharge theworkflows for our usersyes I think that we're only limited byour imagination in terms of what AI cando to the work that we're trying to dotoday and really has the potential totake teamwork to the next levelso already we have a lot of digitaltools that make it really easy for us toproduce content but generative AI reallyturbo charges that and lets us not onlypress a button to create content but toget ideas to synthesize what's happeningto change the format and form factorsuch that we have the right content andare doing that more quicklyand that's good so long as you cannavigate all of that information andfind the right things not just getoverrun by uh you know proliferation ofworkin AI as long as we can then surface themost relevant content and get the rightpeople to to that information then youcan get even more work done you're notjust searching for what you need AI isactually really moving forward yourability to do workthat sounds really interesting what aresome of the use cases as well ascritical user Journeys you think AI hasthe ability to disrupt as well asenhance yeah so as well as a generativecase you know what knowledge workersalso need is to confirm is this contentcorrect is it up to date in some caseshas it been verified by the right personor people or processes has it beenvetted is this something I can trust andAI can really help us there go from justa mess of content that's all inside onetool to do I have the right thingsAI can also help with workflows andAutomation and Matt covered this reallywell in the way that Google isapproaching it we're also thinking aboutthis from an atlassian point of view Ithink that when then as platforms wethink about this together it's bothabout taking busy work and repetitivetasks suggesting and setting up rulesenabling some of that busy work orthings that take a lot of clicks to justbe abstracted away and making sure thatworkflows flow together instead ofhaving to have someone actually tie themtogether themselves so AI in theworkplace Done Right can just make us somuch more efficient and able to focus onthe work that requires Our Brands notjust all of the little things that aredistracting us that makes so much sensewell looking ahead would like to wrap upwith just getting your perspective onvision for future iterations betweenatlassian products and workspace yeah sowe have so many things that we've workedon together and I look forward toextending those even further so you knowfor example once you see one toolworking in the platform can we bringthat to other tools and we have jira andConfluence can we then extend those orextend the actions that we can do rightnow uh Google and Google Docs has aposition for Confluence and jira issuesbut can we bring that to sheets andslides and similarly as we bring evenmore ability to create work for exampleinside Confluence with whiteboards wemake sure that the right GoogleDocuments show up there as well I thinkadditionally as we move into not justenabling generative work but also reallyconnecting workflows making sure thatwe're making that easy on the end userand time together the work they need todo is another place that our partnershipcan just go deeper so I look forward tonext year coming and talking about allof those as we launch them together thatsounds great Genevieve thank you so muchfor your time today for being with ushere sharing your perspective on ourshared workflow Vision as well as how AIcan supercharge it well thank you allfor listening and um Genevieve and Iwill be back for Q a but over to Mattfor now[Applause]thanks Ava and GenevieveSo speaking of AI we have some updatesto share with you about new partners andour growing ecosystem of AI Partnerswe've not only building AI intoworkspace but we've also been working tobring AI native Partners to workspaceso I'll start with typefacetypeface is a company that had anInsight that creating cross-channelmarketing content was to time andresource intensive and also that thestandard AI tools are typically verygeneric I'd love to stand here up onstage and tell you that Bart solvesevery problem everywhere perfectly allthe time the reality is that today youwant an AI that is custom built forcertain scenarios in many cases orcustom trained I suppose at the theright wording so with typeface markerscan create on-brand marketing contentacross multiple channels it learns yourBrand's voice products and audiencesegments to tailor Creations just foryour brandand so typeface integrates with Googleworkspace to generate any kind ofcontent social posts ads blogs and moreit's an example of streamlining contentcreation workflows from within workspaceanother partner that we're working withis Jasper and other gen AI nativepartner Jasper's secure an on-brand AIassistant is now available like it'savailable actually today you can godownload it and then try it out inworkspace and it also helps marketersbuild impactful marketing content docsout on is live today in the workspaceMarketplace if you'd like to try it outand the sheets add-on is coming soon andyou can see the example here in thevideo where a user is able to ask Jaspervia the sheets add-on to create Googleads headlines in multiple languages justby giving contextual input in sheets inthis case prompts like audience andoffers but you can see you can give it along list of inputs click help buttonsand you now have a entire range ofmarketing campaigns just with a fewprompts this is a couple examples of howwe are bringing gen AI Partners intoworkspace to make end users work moreproductivebut it's not just about helping endusers we also want to help app makersand so we're very excited about duet AIin app sheet this allows an app maker tobuild and customize an applicationnatural language that is as a person whowould like to build a a custom app youcan describe in plain language whatyou'd like that app to do roughlyspeaking where the data is coming fromwhat the processes are that that appwill handle and any other app elementsthat you'd quite like so it's very muchan interactive dialogue format soinstead of typing code you're justsubscribing to the AI what you'd likethat app to do this will produce an appthat will work on desktop or mobile oreven embedded apps in Gmail or chat youcan actually even start your appexperience within Google chat so you canstart talking towithin Google Chat and then go directlyto the app sheet editor if you want tomake uh detailed edits laterso how can you make some of thesestreamlined workflows real today well Imentioned I'd talk about some of ourlatest platform capabilities so I wantto make sure I highlight some of theimprovements we've made to the platformover the last little while and some ofthe things that are coming soonbut most importantly every capability webuild is only interesting when it'sadopted by developers and our developerPartners I often tell my team if youbuild an API and nobody uses it did youreally build an API and so it'sfoundationally important to us that wehave a an ecosystem adopting ourplatform and showing off amazing usecases that again benefit our jointcustomers and we've got a lot ofPartners in our ecosystem some big somesmall some are startups some are longestablished players and we're reallyexcited to see the continuing growth ofthat ecosystemso let's say some of these newcapabilities and how they're being usedI'll start with the Google Chat which isa critical connectivity tool for hybridorganizations around the worldchat apps and you've seen some examplesalready allow developers to integrateworkflows right into the context of aconversationand meanwhile AI capable is like naturallanguage processing or actually make iteven easier for somebody to build a chatapp and make it both quick andimmediately productive and understanduser intent very quickly and so we'veseen a lot of Partners like zendesk andpagerduty who are already creatingpowerful chat apps to embed the abilityfor users to interact with those toolsright from within Google Chatnow one of the big launches that I'dlike to highlight is actually the chatAPI is actually just I think in the lastweek gone to General availability chatAPI has all the basic uh crud componentsyou expect on a rest API be able to readwrite messages event notification andwe're also working on more advancedcapabilities like the ability to migratelarger amounts of data built on top ofthatgoal mate is the tool you use to stayconnected in the hybrid workplace and wesaw earlier this is the tool that Chrisuses of his team as wellyou saw earlier today a lot of gen AIfeatures being announced by Empire inthe morning those of course were largelyfeatures within meet so first partyfeatures that they meet but we'd like tostart making meat more more available todevelopers and so a few differentaspects I'd like touch on one is theGoogle meet rest API very similar to thechat API you can programmatically createa meeting you can programmaticallydownload transcripts as examples so justthings of the things you can doautomatically with access to thatprogrammatic APInext is the meet add-ons SDK I gave theexample of figma being embedded withinmeat the Google add-ons SDK allows youto embed your app within the main stagethat is take over the main screen or bea sidebar experience so people can thefolks who are in the meeting can stillbe doing something interactive andseeing each other in the meeting whileinteracting with a smaller experienceoff on the sidebar both of those are nowavailable in public previewand finally we've been working on andstarting to reach preview with our embedSDK this looks at the ability of how wecan badge Google meet into otherapplications so if you wanted to embedvideo specifically Google meet and videowithin your application that is what theGoogle meet SDK embed SDK will help youdowe mentioned smart chips a couple timesthey help you enable smooth workflowsacross Google Docs you can see previewsof data from external resources thingslike project thumbnails customer recordsdashboardsall types of things where you want tounderstand what is this link and and geta preview of it without having to followit and read an entire document to figureout what it's aboutthird party chartships extend the add-onFrameworks there's a type of of add-onand they're available in full Generalavailability today and most importantlyonly on Google workspaces the capabilityis actually uhnot available in a number of our uhcompetitor platformsnow we've seen a really strong receptionfor smart chips and so we're investingmore heavily here we will be bringingthem to additional Services as well asadding more capabilities and so oncapability I'd like to highlight not yetavailable coming towards the uh the endof the year is we will enable developersto extend the app menu within docs sothe app menu is a popular acceleratorwith Google Docs allows you to quicklyaccess various types of functionalityincluding building blocks smart chipsand other accelerators right from thecanvas within docs and so we will allowthird parties and second parties sodevelopers to extend the ad menu toembed capabilities that you can think ofnow while back we added working locationto Google Calendar and as we'll surprisenobody in a room of folks who areinterested in developer topics thenumber one feature request we got wasfor an API and so we're uh reallyexcited to announce that the API is notonly Built but is now generallyavailable that is both a read and writeAPI for working location you can imagineusing that to synchronize withthird-party tools for desk booking orResource Management type applicationsnow when you've built something andyou'd like to distribute an add-on achat app we have the workspaceMarketplace I mentioned the very largenumber of downloads that we've seencoming from the marketplace themarketplace is built for both publiclyavailable apps that is something you arelaunching to to the marketplace to allowothers outside of your company to accessas well as domain internal apps so ifyou're building something within yourdomain and you only want other accountor other users within your domain toaccess that that the marketplacesupports that as well and one thingwe've been working on with themarketplace with the rise of AI is tohelp those apps stand out and so we'veintroduced a new category in themarketplace intelligent apps to allowusers to quickly find AI powered appsnow as a developer we spent a lot ofthis talk talking about end userfeatures but developers are alsointerested in that it's a tooling thatare available to them and so I've talkedabout a couple of these things alreadybut we've talked about app sheet appsheet is a no code tool allowing you tobuild apps and workflows without anycoding whatsoever so you simply dragpre-existing components connect it to adata source and you can produce a afairly simple appfor those with more coding experience wewant more control over the exactcomponentry they're building we haveapps script apps script is based off ofJavaScript it has a built-in IDE andcomes complete with a cloud environmentso there's no need to figure out how tospin up a client environment or if youhave some user who simply wants to writea small script they don't have to figureout how to get a machine to run it on orrun a command line or spin up a gcpruntime all that comes together withinapps script and is available to allusers of workspacefinally if you're a professionaldeveloper we've continued to work on inaddition to the features that we'vetalked about we continue to work on someof the other aspects that make itappealing to be a professional developerwe're all constantly working on ourdocumentation and one thing that we'veintroduced recently is theAPI Explorer which allows you within oneplace to see all of our apis and playwith them in a sandbox so if you aren'tsure what this API does or you aren'tsure what types of response codes itmight give rather than just read thedocumentation actually try it out rightthere from within our documentationso we're excited to get these latestplatform capabilities into your handsand can't wait to see what you build foryourself for your business for sellingto other business on top of workspacenow to start buildings couple things I'dlike to point you to one is ourdeveloper preview program we are for themost part launching all of our net newplatform capabilities to the developerprogram first this gives us a chance toget feedback and a chance for you tostart building on top of our apis andplatform before they go to full Generalavailability and therefore when they areavailable you are able to launch yourSolutions immediately we also have arelatively new YouTube channel thisallows you of course to understand indepth some of the new features that welaunchso don't forget to check out the rest ofthe workspace sessions I know this isjust the uh the first day of theconference and we have quite a fewworkspace sessions a few of them listedthere on screen uh we are out in theShowcase floor and in the hive developerZone I know our entire developerrelations team is here uh our productteam has quite a number ofRepresentatives here who are sort ofcycling in and out of the hive Zone andwe'd love for you to come by chat chatwith us ask any questions you might havelet us know what you're thinking if youwant to submit a feature request we'rehappy to hear about those as well butfeel free to come on byso with that thank you all for comingand please enjoy the rest time next Ibelieve Ava and Genevieve will come backup for uh q a but thank you for takingthe time[Applause][Music]foreign"
