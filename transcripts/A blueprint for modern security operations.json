    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thanks for joining us here todayI'm Chris Gord I am the senior directorof product for security operations hereat Google that's basically all of ouryou know products that power you knowsecurity operations detection andresponse which is Chronicle SimChronicle soar the mandian set ofproducts as well as our threat Intelplatform and virustotal I'm joined byEric Aldridge he's the head of securityengineering and security operations atthe CME Group he's one of our customersthat are on the security operationstransformation Journey with us and sowe're excited to have him here to talk alittle bit about what CME Group has gonethrough and how they've transformedtheir security operationsso I started my career my securitycareer back in 2004 at a company calledRSA security and the reality is I thinkwhen you look about the past 20 years orso we really haven't come that far as asecurity industry in terms of solvingour core true operational Challenge froma security perspective you know at RSAwe were a company that had probably apretty high degree of sophistication wewere a company that had a high degree oftooling we were a company that had ahigh degree of expertise in-house weused to bring customers in to oursecurity operations center we used toshow off all the visibility all theadvancement all the capability that wehad internally but unfortunately in 2011we were subjected to one of the largestI would say most high profile breachesthat have occurred over the last youknow 20 years or so which was the RITRSA secure ID token breach there's areally good wired article about it ifyou really want to read and understandwhat happened during the token breachbut the reality was you know we had ateam internallythat was tracking and looking at loginformationin a very highly manual andlabor-intensive way right again this isback in 2011. and we were collecting alot of information but there was reallyno understanding of truly what washappening in the environment uh and theattacker came into the environment in afairly non-sophisticated way it was astandard fishing attack right andultimately they got a user to click onsomething they shouldn't have clicked ontook advantage of a zero day exploitafter that made their way through theback end systems of RSA you knowultimately reached a database of 70million secure ID token seats uh and itwas a you know sophisticated nationstate attacker and their goal was tobasically exfiltrate those token seedsand try to break into US GovernmentFederal infrastructure by using secureID as kind of the the the door intothose environmentsbut the problem that we saw at the timewas that we really had no I think trueunderstandingof how to under how to look at andreally evaluate whether an attacker wassitting inside our environment and itactually wasn't until we called inmandian at the time again this is youknow back in 2011 to actually inform usof all the in all the you know attackpatterns and all the attack paths thatthe attacker actually went through thatwe even understood exactly what happenedand again we were a company that did nothave uh any lack of sophistication froma security perspective and the reasonwhy I bring this up is you know thereality is we haven't come that far youknow the mandian M trans report ifyou're interested in reallyunderstanding what the attack landscapelooks like and what attackers are up toon a regular basis I recommend thateveryone read that report it comes outevery year it's got a ton of goodstatistics and understanding of whatattackers are up to this is a stat fromlast year's you know the 20 or thisyear's 2023 entrance report63 percent of organizations or 63 ofincidents still result in externalentitiesinforming the organization that they'vebeen breachedand so you take you know 15 20 years ofinnovation that we've had all of theadvancement and security operationstooling all the advancement in how wedeal with you know adversary awarenessand you know sophisticated securitytools all the money that's gone intosecurity investment and the reality isstill in two-thirds of the casesorganizations don't even know they'rebreached right and that's prettyshocking like when you think about itlike we haven't come all that far froman industry perspective uh even afterall this investment the other thingthat's interesting is that you knowadversaries are still pretty much usingsimilar techniques that they use youknow 15 20 years agolike if you look at the M trans reportfrom last year over 50 percent ofincidents that occurredcame in through similar attack vectorsthat we got breached in back in RSA youknow 15 years ago which is malwareexploitation and fishingand you would think that we would havesolved those problems by now to behonest with you I mean those are fairlywell understood attack vectors everyonekind of knows what it's like to have youknow malware running in the environmenthow to evaluate malware everyone knowswhat fishing looks like but that's stillthe vast majority of cases in terms ofhow breaches are happening or howbreaches are getting into the system anattackers you know they're just gettingused to getting around controls theyunderstand how to leverage you knowdifferent types of techniques and anddifferent types of you know use cases toget around common controls but I stillthink we have a long way to come interms of just having our defense toolingyou know catching up to where we need toget it tothe other thing is that you knowattackers are consistently innovatingeven within those attack vectors rightand so if you look at the amount of newmalware families that are beingpublished every single year you knowover 588 new malware families wereidentified forget about the ones thatwere created just the ones that wereidentified by malware uh by mandian uhin the latest M trans report which is apretty shocking number if you comparethat back to where things were 10 yearsago it's probably 10x the number ofmalware families that are beingidentified on a regular basis and so thereality is you know and this is nosurprise attacker is going to keepinnovating attackers are going to keepadvancing their their their approacheseven if they're using common techniquesthey're going to keep trying to findways to get around what you need to whatyou're doing to try to defend yourselfthe other big reason I think that youknow we're seeing a lack of ability fororganizations to actually properlydefend themselves is to be honest thereare many ways using Legacy toolingum I like to refer to Sims as being theultimate do-it-yourself toolit's basically like here's a logaggregation platform here's a way ofstoring and collecting a bunch ofinformationand then good luck everything else is upto you and that's actually the exactsame thing we were doing back in 2011when RSA was breached right it was wewere just collecting a lot ofinformation we had no idea what to lookfor how to look for it you know we knewa little bit we had some reasonablereasonably good security analysts butthere wasn't any actually securityintelligence built into the to the SIMand I think that's still largely wherethings stand today with Legacy Simtechnology the reality is 95 of theworkflow is manual 95 percent of theintelligence that you bring to the tableis done internally by the people thatare operating the Sim and we justhaven't seen an advancement to a moreoutcome-oriented solutionuh I I kind of juxtaposed that a lot tothe endpoint space I think endpoint hasdone a reasonably good job in advancingfrom being just a forensic collectionplatform to being an actual securityfocused you know tool and really anoutcome oriented Tool uh and the realityis I think we need Sims to kind of movein that same direction and become moreoutcome oriented in order for us to beable to solve this problemthe second issue that he run into withSims is that even when you are just youknow trying to collect data and that'sall you're trying to do99 times out of 100 you're notcollecting enough of it either becauseof cost or scale reasons right so everyalmost every single customer I talk tofor one reason or another they'recompromising the amount of informationthat they're sending to their back-endSim you know either because they don'tfeel like the SIM can handle it becausethey're dealing with on-premise Legacyinfrastructure or because they justdon't want to pay the money becausethey're being metered on an ingest basisfor every single piece of data that theysend into the SIMthe other analogy or another you knowstory I like to use is I used to runproduct for an endpoint detection andresponse company before I joined Googlea couple years ago the number onefeature requests that I always got wasexport data filteringmeaning that all customers wanted to dois take all this good information thatwe were collecting from an endpointperspective and filter it so that theycan send it to their Sim in a filteredformat just simply because they didn'twant to deal with the scale or costimplications and I'm not talking aboutalerting right you know it's fine to beable to quiet down your alerts but I'mjust talking about raw forensicinformation there was no reason thatpeople should have been filtering thatdata before I got to the Sim because youreally want to use that forinvestigation and forensics but thereality is people you know really neededto do that just simply from a cost andscale perspectiveand the last piece is like I mentionedthere's no like what I would calloutcome oriented solution right there'sno ability for you to a tie anunderstanding of what attackers aredoing in traditional Sim environmentsright you look at the leaders in thesame space not to pick on any individualone but the reality is they're not trulyyou know security companies that have areal deep understanding of securityBehavior right and one of the mainreasons that we purchase mandians youknow last year was really so that we canenhance our ability to truly understandwhat attackers are up to enhance ourability to truly deliver that on top ofa you know scalable data platform withuh with Chronicleand so when I look at you know where Simneeds to go and where securityoperations needs to go in the future itreally comes down to these five thingsuh in our mind the first is you know itsounds fairly simple but we need to stopbeing reactive and we need to move intoa more proactive stanceI think you've seen a lot of this inCloud infrastructure and you've seenthis pretty well from a cloudinfrastructure point of view wherepeople are really pushing towards a moreproactive understanding of where riskexists in your Cloud infrastructurehow your posture is kind of set up andwhere you might have misconfigurationsand how do you patch the holes thatmight exist in order for attacker not tobe able to get in the first placewe have to bring that level of awarenessinto security operations right thereality is you really don't have a lotof context about the environment thatyou're trying to protect in atraditional Simfrom our point of view we're looking tochange that we're looking to reallybring that understanding proactively ofwhat adversaries are doing where youmight be exposed how do we validate thatyour controls are in the right place atthe right time and how do we just andunderstand based on business risk whatyou should be most focused on at anygiven time and do that proactively notjust reactively based on threatthe second is you know you just can'teverything can't be manual everythingcan't be people dependent all the timeyou obviously need to have really goodpeople sitting in front of the screenbut we have to bring some intelligenceinto the equation but we also have tobring some ability to remove manualeffort in manual toiland you know we've all seen a lot of theinformation about AI come out over thelast year the reality is there's asignificant amount of opportunity nowthat exists with Advanced AIfunctionality to really removea high degree of manual toil frompeople's day-to-day lives in everydayuse cases like security operationsand I think we're starting to prove thatwith a lot of the things that we'reintegrating into everything you know allthe products around Google Cloud butespecially on the security side where wecan really get to the point where wehave ai guided and assistedinvestigation and response right whereit's not just about a human needing toyou know use AI for one particular partof the workflow but instead we actuallyhave a highly trained highly tuned AIyou know engine really guiding andleading you toward an investigative pathwhich I'll talk about that more in asecondthe third is about moving away from justhaving threat Intel feeds and justoverlaying thread Intel data in a morewhat I would call blind fashion toreally applying thread Intel in a muchmore curated outcome driven fashionand what I mean by that is like itshould be mostly the job of the vendorin my opinion to really apply threadIntel in the right wayand that's not the way I think mostsecurity operations organizations runit's not the way most Sims run to behonest with you most Sims are on youknow the whole idea of having a threadIntel platform a tip that whole Marketexists because people are trying toaggregate collect and align their threatIntel feeds to make sense out of themfor their own Sim environment which bydefinition is a really odd thing to asksomeone to do right we should be theones as vendors or other SIM vendorsshould be the ones that are helping youapply the right intelligence at theright times right and we should be ableto do that through this notion ofcurated outcomes so you just come inflip a switch say you're looking tounderstand the latest breach analyticsyou want a mandated intelligence to beapplied across your data and we shouldbe able to do that in a much moreautomated and much more curated fashionthe third is around you know drivingcontextual awareness and contextualinformation and when you're dealing withinvestigation and responseand that it kind of moves away from thisnotion of just dealing with alerts rightwe don't want to obviously an alert isthe thing that you want to be able toknow to be able to be notified about butthe reality is we have to provide youthe right level of context when you'reperforming your investigative tasksone way we're doing this in chroniclewhich I'll talk about in a second isthis idea of cloud detection andresponse where when you're dealing witha event or an alert inside of your Cloudenvironment we actually augment and tellyou everything you need to know aboutthe contexts of that asset or thatentity that you're investigating aroundand using that context you can make muchmore well-informed decisions right andwe do that because we know a lot aboutthe environment in which you'reoperating in because you're runninginside of Google Cloud but you can alsoapply that same level of contextualaware awareness anywhere in theinfrastructure as long as we bring inthe right level of informationand then the last piece is you shouldnever have to worry about being capacityconstrained or cost constraint rightthat should not be a consideration thatever has to enter into a Securityoperation professional's mindand so that's one thing I think we'vesolved right from the beginning withChronicle which is just you flip theswitch it's a SAS driven surface it'swhat we call infinitely scalable it runson the same backbone that search andYouTube and Gmail run on top of and sowe have the ability of just dealing withlarge data volumes searching throughthose data volumes at a way higher youknow performance rate than any othervendor that's out there todayuh and so what we've done with the uhthe integration Chroniclesimplify which was now renamed Chroniclesoar the mandian portfolio is Rel aswell as our Intel information that havecome from Google's internal threatenedthreat analysis group as well asvirustotal just kind of integrated allthis into one overall overarchingsecurity operations platformuh and the reality is you know we'reable to cover a pretty wide swath of allthe things that I talked about you knowpreviously by combining all theseTechnologies together and really runningon top of the world's most scalable dataLake and Chronicles from the ground upand there's kind of Three core thingsthat I would always point to and andcustomers ask like what are the bigthings that Chronicle does that'sdifferent than what you're what you'regoing to get in market today the firstisjust that ability to run and operate atGoogle scale and Google speedright so I mentioned the fact thatGoogle was you know Chronicle was builtfrom the ground up on top of the sameinfrastructure that powers ourconsumer-facing applications uh andthat's true like one of the interestingtidbits about Chronicle was actuallydeveloped for an internal use caseinside of Google to be able to power ourown internal security operations and itwas actually built before Google Cloudwas kind of even a thing and so we builtit on top of an infrastructure corecalled Borg inside of Google which isthe same backbone that runs ourconsumer-facing applications and so wecan you know we've proven I think prettyconsistently that we can pull in andscale large amounts of information storethat information for 12 months bydefault in hot storage and searchthrough that information faster than anyother vendor that's out thereand right there you get a pretty youknow you know amazing benefit which isthe fact that you don't have to worryabout filtering information arbitrarilyand we can deliver that to you at a costprofile that's way more attractive thanwhat you're going to get with othervendors because we're operating on topof our own infrastructurethe second piece is we're able to takewhat I believe is the world's bestthreat intelligence you know bar youknow I think almost definitely more thanany other SIM vendor out there but Iwould argue over any other even securityvendor out there and we're able to applythat on top of your data at high degreesof scaleand so when I talk about the world'sbest and threat intelligence I want youto think about a few things first thinkabout the breadth of information thatGoogle has access toI think there's 2.5 billion or soum people in the world that are usingChrome on a daily basisthat's like you know 30 of the world'spopulation uh every single day usingChrome browsersGoogle is able to understand and seeattacker activity and the attack surfaceacross that level of scale through youknow initiatives like safe browsingwe're actually looking at malwaredownloads you know through Chrome we'reable to do that through Gmail byevaluating phishing attacks and so whenyou have this wide scale of billions ofusers and you have the ability ofunderstanding the attacker landscapeacross that level of population it'svery very very unlikely that any otherspecific security vendor could even comeclose to that level of breadth and we'vealways had that level of breath you knowinside of Google and we store all thatinformation in a back-end uh you knowteam called Tac which is the threatanalysis group inside of Googlea few years ago probably 10 years ago weaugmented that by buying virustotalvirus total is the world's preeminentmalware and ioc you know reputationdatabase it Aggregates informationacross you know every single AV vendorevery single you knowum uh you know vendor that's sending indomain-based information about ioc aboutioc and you know potential attackvectors there and I think we have over2.4 billion entries inside of Iris tooland so we have a fairly wide footprintjust understanding the attack landscapeand the attack surface just given thatlevel of breadth right there's not manyother vendors that can look at thatlevel of breath across the boardwith mandian what we're able to do isaugment that with a significant amountof depth right and so what mandian doesis tracks specific threat actor Behaviorit tracks specific threat campaigns youknow they have direct researchers thatare out there looking at specificattacker activity and they're provingthat like on the front lines by actuallyoperating real incident responseengagements with customers every singledayand so when you combine that level ofbreaths with that level of depth thatMandy and is bringing to the tablein my opinion and I think an opinion ofmost of the people inside of Googleyou're going to get the world's bestthreat intelligenceand the idea is not just to have thatthread Intel and hand it to a customerand say figure it out yourself the ideais to what we call apply that threatintelligence inside a productand what we mean by that is every singleevent that comes into Chronicle we wantto enrich and augment that eventwith threat intelligence from the groundupyou know we could be ingesting trillionsof events for any given customer at anygiven time every single one of those wewant to run through our threat Intelplatforms we want to see if it'sassociated with the malware family wewant to see if it's associated with thecampaign we want to see if it'sassociated with a threat actor and thenwe want to take the metadata that we seeabout Association and append it to theevent so that you have it as part ofyour core investigative workflow everytime you have an event inside aChroniclewe then want to also do analysis on topof those events to see if any of thosethings we think are highly indicative ofactive breaches and that's a featureinside of Chronicle that we call breachAnalyticsand so that's what I mean by appliedthreat intelligence when you're dealingwith you know number one needing to haveaccess to the world's best Intel butnumber two needing to apply that accessat scale I really don't think any otherSIM vendor out there is coming close towhat we're able to do inside ofChronicle from that perspectiveand then the third is this notion of AIinfused productivity right and so allthe things that you're seeing with chatCPT all the sort of momentum that's beenhappening around AI lately all of thathas really been technology andcapability that was first researchedand open source by Google back in 2017.and so you knowI think it's almost it's fairly easy tosay that if anyone can apply large-scaleAI approaches into security and do itwell uh that Google is a greatorganization to be able to do that andthe reality is in order for you to beable to apply AI at scale and do it wellyou're going to need to do that on topof large amounts of information and sothe chronicle value proposition kind offeeds on itself here because the moreinformation that we have at any giventime to be able to train the model thebetter off we are in actually operatingyou know true AI advancement on top ofcustomer security operations profilehere's just the proof point from one ofour customers and talking talking abouthow Chronicles reduced mean time toresolution I love this quote it's one ofthe things that we take most pride inwhich is how do we help a customeractually tangibly improve their returnon investment and actually really helpthem reduce mean time to resolution andthe reality is when you stack a lot ofthese capabilities and these benefitstogether you start to see really truetangible results from customers likethis who are you know truly able todemonstrate and measure how they seesecurity operations changing insidetheir environmentI talked about our ability to applyIntel here's some you know additionalstatistics the big thing I like to pointout here is just the size of themandiant research team and so not onlydo we run over 1400 incident responseengagements a year where we're out therein the trenches with customers operatingthe latest and greatest incidents but wealso have I think a world-class if notthe best research team that's performingdirect Intel research every single daywith over 500 analysts and so probablythe two biggest breaches that you'veheard about over the last you know threeor four or five years which is the logfor Jay breach and the solarwinds breachboth of those things were identified thecampaign families the attackers and thetechniques row identified by thatmandian research team right and so theseare the kind of people that are workingevery single day to really bring andapply those threat intelligencecapabilities into Chronicle and intosecurity operations at Googlethis is just an example of clouddetection and response you know I know alot of the rooms probably Google Cloudcustomers and this is just a way inwhich we bring contextual awareness tothe equation to help you perform yourdetection and response activities rightand the reality is what we're able to dois take our understanding of theattacker landscapedeliver curated detections inside ofChronicle where I can just simply flip aswitch and turn on cloud detections butthen when I do see alerts I'm able toleverage the context the understandingof the infrastructure and Landscape tomake it easier for you to Pivot andunderstand what that alert really meansin context right which machine is it onWhat entity is it on what is that entityperforming what is it connected towhat's the associated risk of thatentity right and how important is it forme to deal with this incident right nowall those things are what we mean bycontextual awareness right and that'swhat you know effectively is bubbled upinto Cloud detection and responsethe other thing that we announcedyesterday is something called Mandy andhunt for chroniclethis is where we take that reallypowerful team of 500 analysts and Intelresearchers that are on the back end wehave a team that's performingoperational kind of detection andresponse every day for for hundreds ofcustomers and what we do is we layerthat on top of Chronicle information andso if you're a Chronicle customer insideyour Chronicle tenant you caneffectively have the mandian teamperform what we call silent huntingwhere they deploy a set of hunting rulesthey deploy a set of emerging threatindicator rules and they effectivelyjust perform it ongoing threat hunts tolook for attacker activity happening inyour environment and if they seeanything they can bubble that right upto you and basically alert you thatthere's something significant that youshould look at so this is a great way ofyou know what I would call getting thatoperational outcomeby leveraging the world's best expertson top of it platform that's scalablefor the futureand then the last thing I'll point outbefore Eric comes up here and talksabout his journey is you know what we'vedelivered with duet Ai and Chronicleright uh and this is you know I think acapability that right now is what Iwould call human lead and AI assistedwhere the human is actually promptingthe llm and the SEC Palm model behindthe scenes to basically make it easierto perform tasks that are somewhatcumbersome and manual in nature toperform like writing searches in oursearch language which is Unified datamodel or like writing rules in our rulelanguage which is URLwhile those things are doable it's mucheasier to be able to ask a machine to doit and do it very quicklywhere we're going with this is actuallyreally pushing it Beyond just beinghuman-led and AI assisted to what wecall you know AI guided basedinvestigation so what we've done iswe've trained the SEC Palm modelwith basically every single researchreport that mandian has published witheverything that exists inside avirustotal and so think about the duetAI capability in chronicle as being theworld's best threat researcher andthreat analyst sitting right alongsideun product and so as we move into nextyear what you'll start to see in thisinvestigation panel on the right handside is it prompting you on things thatyou should look at in your data setbased on what it sees as potentialmalicious activityand that's what we mean by AI guidedbased investigation where it's actuallyhelping you along the way and making youbetter at your job on a regular basisand these are the kind of things thathonestly I don't think any other vendorcan really come close to mostly becausethey don't have the Intel to be able totrain the model but also just becausethey don't have the AI capability to beable to deliver itso that said you know uh it's one thingto listen to me but it's also a muchbetter thing to listen to customers talkabout their Journey so I just want towelcome Eric on the stage to talk aboutCME[Applause]thank you Chris good morning everybodyI've been looking forward to this for awhile and I want to thank Google andChris and googler partners for theopportunity to share with you uh cme'sjourney through uh modernizing andsecurity operationswith its 175 year history CME Group is aplace where the world comes to manageriskusing our Benchmark products ourcustomers can trade options Futuresoptimize portfoliosand analyze vast data setsmy name is Eric Aldrich and I am part ofCME group's information security teamumI work with technology and BusinessLeaders in throughout CME Group to helpsee me safely take advantage of newbusiness opportunitieswhat I'd like to share with you today isour journey as we modernize our securityoperations where we're still early inour journey but we like what we'reseeing and I think we're headed in theright directionso first I'd like to go through some ofthe drivers that we have considered bothinternally and externally as we're kindof establishing that Journey I'd like totalk about some of the principles thatwe used for our planning to sort ofCenter ourselves as we as we moveforwardI'd like to share some of the outcomesthat that we're expecting out of thatJourney as we move through using thepeople process and Technology frameworkthen I'd like to kind of share how we'vestacked up some of the deliverables uhum that we're going to be performingthrough our journey and then I'll thenI'll closeso CME has embarked on a digitaltransformation rightum with its partner Google in thistransformation andone of the things that we're looking foris new ways of providing valueand Innovation to our customers at apace that we can increase right so thatour digital transformation allows us toprovide value new products to ourcustomers more quicklyso my team is responsible for helping toyou know safelyumuh allow the business to move into thosenew opportunities so we had tocarefully think about how we were goingto help the business approach it digitaltransformationso one of the things that we focused onwas really what the value of ourbusiness our security business withinCME Group what did we want that value tobebecause we needed to ground what we weredoingumin certain principles that would help usmove forward and we knew that we wewould have some failures but that weneeded these principles and values tomake sure that we were always able toCenter ourselves on our journeyso the values that wetypically the value for an informationsecurity team might be expressed is youknow to protect the confidentialityintegrity and availability of yourcompany's data and systemsI would argue that that is that isimportant but it doesn't fully Expresswhat the value of a security team canprovide and that isas Chris mentioned you know focusingmore on the outcomes that that thebusiness wants and the businessesability to compete through providingInnovation and new products to itscustomerssoand then so we focused on what thatvalue would be and what we would need todo in order to uh focus on on deliveringthat value and and as uh analogy I liketo use to illustrate that is is thedifference between a guard dog and asheepdog righta gordo goes to work every day expectingits environment to be exactly the sameas it was the day before the week beforethe month before the guard dog has abunch of infrastructure that it uses toprotect the environment as a fenceoutside of the fence and inside of thefence it has a building maybe the thecrown jewels right and and the guard dogis good at that right that's that's athat's been a good kind of structure butwhat if the opportunities of thatbusiness move elsewhere what if thecustomers move elsewhere that's not amodel that is really going to help thatbusiness compete and and safely providenew innovation to its customersthe Sheepdog on the other hand goes towork every day knowing expecting thatits environment is going to change andit has built change and Dynamics intothe way that it's it protects the flockright so that flock can move to NewOpportunities any day if that's what'sneeded and the in the Sheepdogunderstands how to manage risk for thatflock in a way that brings the riskprofile within the company's risk or theflocks risk appetite so to speakso so part of what we needed to do isreally understand where the value is andchange our culture and our mindset inproviding that value and so we needed torethink the way that we were doing thatour macro world I mean let's be realhere right it can be crazy right if youthink about all the external factorsthat that create threats for us theslightest little kind of uh Globalevents creates a Cascade of fishingemails and cyber attacks that we have toprotect ourselves against theTechnologies are constantly changingand if you think about where we'reactually doing work and where our datais it's everywhere on anything at anytime right so that's an external riskthat we needed to to provide safe passesfor so to speak for a companyTalent as well is you know this is not anew issue for any of us we all know thatumwe all need time you know uh cyber staffand there's a lot of openings that arejust uh unfilled right you know I'veheard here in a couple of sessions thatthere are hundreds of thousands if notyou know millions of openings that can'tbe filledpart of the reason for that is becausewe sort of need these cyber securityunicorns right and there there's justnot enough of themum and so you know information securityunfortunately is still a bit of a blackart like you still need people who arevery well versed you know very tenuredand well-versed in you know securityprotocols and network protocols andattackers and all this stuffrate of change is also something that isuh you know a risk as well right becauseif you think about how technology andthe way that we work has changed overthe last decade right you know we hadfirst moving from on-prem to Cloud thenwe had our supply chain moving to thecloud and then we had you know uh we hadthe pandemic and everybody's workingfrom home uh and then you have machinelearning AI generative AI all these newthings that are creating risksconstantlyrate of change has another side to itthat probably should have been includedon on the first slide but rate of changeis a risk for my team if we can't changeat the rate that the company wants tochange so if we can't provide securityservices at the rate that the companyneeds to provide value to its customerswe become a blocker so from that's arisk that we're trying to address aswellso when we were talking about thejourney and the plan that we wanted tocreate we we identified some principlesand I won't read everything on thisslide here but we identified someimportant principles again so that we sothat we knew that this is a long journeyand we're just starting out and we knewthat we would go up path right so weneeded some principles to be able tobring us back to our bearingand and and some of those principles arehere so one of the most important onesthat we identified was if you're doingsomething today don't don't continuethat right because that thing thatyou're doing todayyou designed it for a legacy environmentright and you don't want to carry thatover into the new way of of being moreflexible and providing value to thebusiness you need we need to be moredynamic in things that we that wecreated in in theLegacy or traditional version ofourselves likely wouldn't carry forwardso sometimes you're in a meeting whenyou hear somebody say hey we've alwaysdone it that waythat's a huge red flag right so we wantto make sure that we're being proactiveabout identifying things that we need tochangeagain we need to understand who ourcustomers are within the business we'rebusiness within CME Group and we havevarious customers we have businesscustomers you know my engineering teamhas the sock is a customer right and sowe need to focus on what thoseparticular business customers needed andwhen they needed the rate that theyneeded it and so and and how Dynamic weneeded to be in doing that we need tomake sure that we were doing that in asafe waythe other principle is we need toprepare our teams for this change thisis a this is really about a culturalchange a way of sharing the impact thatwe want to have with the businessso moving away from that kind of likewe're providing confidentialityintegrity and availability and expandingthat to providesafe deployments of of new features andInnovation to our customers at the ratethat the business needs to do it and weneeded to really work with our teams toget out of thatI'm creating a I'm task based I'mcreating the security widget to reallyhaving a broader mindset to say how iswhat I'm doing today going to make thebusiness successfulwe wanted to move away from thewaterfall kind of project-based kind ofdeploying these you know eight 12 monthlong projects right we needed to breakthe if we're going to be more Dynamic weneeded to break our services up intochunks that could be delivered to thebusiness on an incremental basis so thatthe business can move as quickly as itneeded to move so we needed to to learnhow to iterate we needed to learn to becomfortable with dropping in a minimumviable product versus this gigantic12-month project and and that worksbecause the business is iterating aswell and so we allow the business todrop in their MVP we put in our MVP andwe make sure that we're that what we'reputting in obviously needs to reduce therisk of that that deployment within ourrisk appetite but you will find ways tobreak up your services and your productsinto ways that allows them to bedeployed in a way that allows thebusiness to be dynamicof course we need to increment thosethings and we so we need to have asystem we where CME Group is using theagile methodology now to to make surethat we can we can be dynamic with thebusiness and we're working in the samekind of cadence and cycle that thebusiness is and we want to keep thingsmoving we want those increments to keephappening so that we keep addingmaturity to thoseto those deployments those initialdeploymentsfinally we want to delete things and andby deleting I don't mean likehey we're not really doing this anymoreso maybe we shouldn't anymore what Imean is proactively looking for thingshunting for things that you can kill andthe reason you need to do that isbecause those are consuming resourcesthat you can reapply into yourtransformationand so that's important so that you canfind those things in cultural the waythat people think about what they'reproviding you can you can find that in aprocedural that technical debt andfinancial debt all these things haveareas that you can hunt for and reapplythose Investmentsso we talked a little bit about thedrivers andum now these are I'll share with some ofthe outcomes that we're looking forusing people process technologywe want to make sure that our people asI mentioned before are outcome orientedthat they're looking for the completepicture they're not creating you knowsecurity widgets you know blind to whatwhat what their impact to the businessis we need to make sure that everybodyon the team knows what the business goalis and that they're supporting that intheir role in securitywe need to make sure that our people areempowered right that we don't have tohavepeople working in a verticalorganization Silo that has to askpermission from their manager to go talkto another department right so as partof our agile transformation we're alsocreating horizontally based teams thathave all the skill sets needed to createSolutions without having to spend a lotof time escalating and they can solveproblems in the two experience that theyhave and that helps us be very Dynamicand and help the business uh beingprovide value to our customerswith the empowerment comesaccountability right and so with thatwith those horizontal teams that areaccountable for delivering on uh on theplanning and you know there are lessonsthat we'll learn from that and we'llreapply that into the processwe want to relocateuh our people's value right we want toget our people into the ooda loop asquickly as possible Right like we weneed security unicorns because there's alot of manual toil context generationsummarization you have to you have toknow how to connect all that data that'sin your sim and you need a very tenuredperson in order to be able to do thateffectively in a way that you canprotect your company we want to be ableto democratize access to that analysisand decision-making phase to maybepeople that might not be as tenured thatmight be more Junior right so that wecan have a we can have easier access toumyou know uh security candidates rightsecurity team members and we also cankeep our humans in the place thatthey're best at right people people getburned out and and they leave because ofthe manual work that they have to do andthey're not in the space that they'regood at which is analysis and decisionmakingum process outcomes that we wanted wewanted our process to be dynamic we wantthem to provide a lot of context and wewanted them to be extremely queryableand some of the tools that Googleprovides the clinical Sim and thenatural language processing you knowwe've been able to begin using some ofthese tools that provide this Rich dataset and keep our analysts in that oodaLoop more often we want our processes toalso be coded and unsupervised we have alot of documentation we have hundreds oftriage procedures run books Play Booksincident response procedures many ofthose things can be automated and so wewant an outcome that we want ourprocesses is to take as much of thatstuff that is wrote and can be put intocode and do that we want to make surethat those things are measured andoptimized so that we can take thoselearnings and improve our processes andso we've kind of recoined the SR thesite reliability engineering term tokind of security reliability engineeringon our team payments so we want to makesure that we're measuring those thingsas well so that we can always belearning and improvingfor technology that's the dessert formost of us that's the thing that wealways run to first it's fun to playwith the technology and and we have aswell but we want to make sure that ourtechnology isum is really being driven by the firsttwo people in process and supportingthose things and so we want our we wantour technology to be process oriented wedon't we don't want technology silos weopen Point solution we want a process ofprotection what's the outcome that wewant out of that process and we wanttools that can support that andChronicle Sim has that broad visibilityacross the Enterprise field of view sothat as our company is connectingtogether the the Google services thatwe're using to create innovation ofproducts those things automatically flowinto uh into the systems that we'reusing with Google Chronicle soar uh uebatools right those things automaticallycome in and we don't need to spend a lotof time building infrastructure toprotect those thingsfinally we want the technology toprovide context we want the ability forthose you know we will need extremelytenured people but we also want the moreJunior people to be able to performeffectively as well and so we want tomake sure that the technology we'reusing like the duet Ai and some of thesome of the other features that arebeing added to Chronicle Sim we want tomake sure that those things enable youknow democratize access to the securityfunctions of to more of our teamso quickly on our transformation ofmodern operationsum we we stacked upum we stacked our deliverables into fourphases and between uh those phases wealso have some Applause right so that wecan internalize and build muscle memoryand train on what we learned in in thein each of the phases and essentiallyphase one is really about deliveringthat mvpputting an initial set of context inthere uh discovering the differences orthe gaps between what you're doing inyour on-prem environment and and how youwould need to refactor and transformthose things into the clinical Simenvironment then we paused we did abunch of testing Google was you knowvery a very good partner as far ashelping us to create excuse me trainingand capture the flags so that we couldbuild that muscle memory and our and ourteam could learn what this stuffactually looks like in the real worldand then phase two was about building onthat content adding some maturityum you know moving to Agile for our teamas well and we're in the middle of phasetwo and phase three right now phasethree is going to be aboutadding more automation moving more uhmore firmly towards autonomous sockoperations adding machine learning andartificial intelligence just learninghow to use AI workbench and some of thetools that we're previewing right nowand maturing our use of these productsand thenphase four is really about normalizingall these things and making them becomeBAU so that we could run them on our ownand then sort of getting the keys handedover towards us so that we can you knowcarry that forward into BYU stateso putting it all togetherit this is a this is really about amindset shift for our team right thetechnology obviously important and andwe're using that but it's really abouthaving your team understand what theoutcome is that the team needs to haveand that is a broad business outcomeuh planning is a key to success in inthat we have to make sure that we have aplan and some principles so that if wecome off course that we're guided backon and then just you know then executethank you very much and I'm going tohand this back to Chris I think[Applause]another survey and please you know giveus some feedback I don't think we haveany time for live questions but Eric andI will both be up here after the sessionso if you're interested in ask us anyquestions by all means come up whenhappy to chat and thanks again foreveryone taking the time to join us thismorning we appreciate it"
