to cover we have eightdemos that's a lot of demos so we'regoing to go through the intro partreally quickly so you can get to thatvery exciting demo my name is RachelGoodman Moore I should not hit my micany more than I already have and I'm aproduct manager here at Google cloud andI'm Arthur also a product manager atGoogle Cloudso we're going to share with you aboutapp sheet and especially some new andrecent development of the platformso as I said we're going to go throughthis sort of context setting part reallyfast that includes going through theagenda really fast but we are breakingthe session up into five parts you cansee them on the slide here first we'regoing to talk about challenges some ofthe challenges we often see businessesface maybe even businesses like yours intheir digital transformation next we'lltalk about what app sheet is and how ithopefully helps address some of thosechallenges at scale sections three andfour will get into those demos we'lltalk about what app sheet does sort offrom an in-depth view we'll actually seeit happen as well as some of the newcapabilities that app sheet has releasedand at the end we will hopefully putsome of our it friends Minds at rest andlook at how we offer some unifiedcontrols for admin and security focusedfolks and hopefully at the very endwe'll have some time left over forquestionsso with that saidnow if you are here at next you areprobably very very very familiar withthe concept of digital transformationsometimes the challenging reality ofdigital transformation now I wouldimagine in this room alone there areprobably hundreds of differenttypes of businesses hundreds ofdifferent types of organizationshundreds of different types ofdeployments and you all have all havehundredsof tens of thousandsunique business processes within yourorganizations your own sets ofrequirements within your organizationsfor what it actually means to translatethe work your teams do every day theworkflows your team takes on every daythis individual magic that your teamslead every day for translating all ofthose things into digital Solutionsthere are so many different solutionsthat need to be transformed so manydifferent tools that can possibly beused to do thatand the sheer magnitude that's yourscope of the work of really not takingnot just the most visible processprocesses but some of the the lessfrequently used ones or the morelocalized ones like some of the ones yousee on this Slide the concept oftranslating those into a fullycloud-based fully digital solution canseem daunting just based on the sheernumberof opportunities and options that wemust pursueso I.T traditionally provide Centraldistributed systems and solutions foryour key workflows so for example youhave a CRM system for your sales enabledit might also provide a Contentmanagement solution if you have a lot ofdigital content but there are a lot ofother things that your teams need to doevery day but that falls outside of itspurviewso some of these processes are here onthe slide just to name one or two youhave to do onboarding of new teammembers every team kind of like doesthat rightif you're running operating a facility abuilding you need to be able to managemaintenance requests right so these arethe processes that we want to talk toyou about because that may be wherethere's like some gaps in your digitaltransformation strategyso let's talk a littlebit those gapsGap see when businesses in thatoverarching strategy it comes from onetwo or maybe all three of these areas ata really high levelTools in your organization do things thesame way every organization at thehighest level has their sort of ownunique way of doing things their ownspecial sauce their own magicformula for getting whatever it is donethat you need to get donebut taking a one-size-fits-all approachto a digital transformation strategybuying one type of tool or one or twotypes of tools that are supposed toaddress all of these use cases kind ofmakes the assumption that all of the usecases are the same that they are allstandardizable and thatthe point it kind of erases theuniqueness and the the benefit that yourorganization gets from your unique wayof doing things and if anythingthat makes digital transformation sortof an inhibitor to Innovation and toVelocity rather than something that canenable itbuilding your own custom solutions toaddress all of those unique problemskind of the only option if we're sayingthat a generalizable solution erases thethe benefit building those individualSolutions is very expensive buyingindividual solutions to each of thoseproblems that addresses your uniquebusiness needs is very expensivewe can maybe come up with a centrallymanaged solution for the most visibleprocesses or the most common processesor maybe those few that do kind of matchbusiness to business butit doesn't work for that long tailorprocesses some of the ones we saw on theslide before the ones that probably aretop of mind for us when we're talkingabout or when I'm talking about likewhat's that unique thing that yourbusiness does it's hard to capture allof those with a single unified tool orone or two tools to address youroverarching business optimization needsso what happens without Solutions herethese long tails of solutions or sorrywithout Solutions here these long tailsof opportunities of problems of businessprocesses that need to be translatedinto workflowsthey don't get solved they either gounder digitized or you sort of put halfof it in the cloud and leave the otherhalf on paper or you leave half of it inone tool and the other half of it in theother tool they don't get solvedor they don't come up with solutionsthat actually increase their velocitythe velocity of your organization or theprocesses that you need to do to getyour magic done and that means that yourbusiness gets left behind when it comesto its digital transformation efforts sohow do we fix what do we do about thatwhat type of capabilities do we offer tohelp you equip your teams with itapproved solutions for addressing thosemultiple multiple variations ofprocesses that make your business thespecial one that it ishow do we solve this problemso you want to empower everyone withinyour organization with the tools so thatthey can build the solutions that theyneed where and when they need themand doing that means a couple of thingsfirst you need to give these tools tothe right people the people that arethat know these processes best and theyare the process owners the team membersand the problem solvers within yourorganizationand they're the relevant people becausein the end they're the one dealing withyou know the processes and the issuesthat you know are associated with themum most importantly you need to givethem tools that make sense to them thatare intuitive to use usable by them butalso that are adapted to their needsand you know remember they're not theirjob is not about software development orI.T it's about running and owning theseprocesses so it's really importantnow the second point is probably thatyou need to give thema tool that lets them build solutionsthat work in their environmentand their environment is generallyspeaking your business right so thatmeans it uses it and it connects to yourdata and it means also that it thesolutions need to work in the ways andplaces that these teams are working sothat can beyou know in a web browser and a laptopbut that could be a mobile app maybebeing even offline or that can be themusing email chat or Google Docsso in the end what you want really is atool that really is going to complementthe unique needs of your business andnot something that's going to workagainst itand not to make things even harder butyou also need a tool that offers itcontrol and visibility of what all ofthese Solutions are that we're nowempowering anyone to create and that arenow accessible on multiple surfaceswithin a business you need a solutionthat can provide solutions that are safeand secure and com in compliance withyour unique environments needs whilestill again doing all the things wementioned enabling anyone to build thesolutions that they need to solve theirbusiness problemsso doing all three of those thingsempowering business process ownersnon-technical business process owners tobuild the solutions to the problems thatthey know best letting them do itwithout requiring a computer sciencedegree or even the need to write asingle line of code and doing all ofthose things in a way that doesn't makeit's heart race any faster than it mayalready be racing at this point in thedaythat's the solution that appsheet offersnow before we talk about why and look athow I want to actually back up a littlebit and ask maybe a question we shouldhave asked asked already but that iswhat what is app sheet anyway wellshe is there's no code app developmentplatform andit enables users to rapidly buildSolutions and automate processes withoutcodeso let's look a little bit deeper rightum how does it work well if your appcreators already have data they simplyneed to connect their app to that dataand that data could be living in a SQLdatabase for example but it could alsobe even just in a Google sheetthe only requirement really is that thedata is organized as a table so each rowrepresents a record right and eachcolumn represents a data field thatcould be name addressprice things like thatonce that's donethe app creators have access to what wecall the app sheet editor that lets thatlets them essentially customize theapplication that they have created andthe important part is that this appsheet editor is no code so they don'thave to write any line of code theyessentially select customization among arich a large set of Rich featuresand yeah that's just the basic ofappsheet now if you're one of the 10million paying workspace customers orthree billion worldwide users appsheetis the no code development tool ofchoice for really tapping into theextensibility of of the workspaceplatform as a whole now on the screenyou can see sort of some canonicalworkspace apps you see at the bottomthere is Gmail and calendar and driveand docs so on and so forth and on topof that are connected to it that's whatthe arrow is meant to show connected toit are appsheet apps that actualcustomers have built on top of theseworkspace tools now what do I mean by ontop of well by using some of these toolsas data sources or extending thecapabilities of those tools by makingthem available via an app or perhapstriggered by an automation that one isconfigured to run in that app you can asan app creator build a whole bunch ofthings Beyond a sheet or a dock orcalendar so on and so forth you canbuild some of the things we've seen wesee on here these are common examples ofreal apps Health assessments inventorymanagements quote creators fielddelivery not going to read the slide youcan read the slide the point being ifyou take anything away from this slideand this section of the presentationit's that what app sheet really does isit allows you to bundle together thefunctionality the data from one or a fewor maybe even multiple of the tools thatyou have access to as a part ofworkspace or even in the greater gcpecosystem Google Cloud ecosystem or evenBeyond even beyond the walls of Googlebundle those things together to buildthe custom solutions to your businessprocess problemswe've talked about what app sheet iswe've talked about a little bit sort ofat a high levelhigh level space now let's see it inaction we have a whole bunch of demos asI mentioned I think we have eight solet's jump into the first one and seewhat app sheet can really do Arthurthank you Rachelso let's take the example of uh Mary andher team who are managing a corporateoffice building okay the team isresponsible for operations MaintenanceCleaning even security and energymanagementum one of the process that her teamwants to improve on is managing themaintenance requests they're submittedby people who work in the building rightand today that process is kind of likead hoc and manual and as a resultwell sometimes it just takes longer thanit should to fix an issue or even toinvestigate it right Additionally theteam in general Mary herself but the thethe team members as well have littlevisibility on like the progress of theseissues and resolving these issues sowe're going to take a look at what anapp sheet solution could look like andwe're going to look at it from theperspective of uh from two perspectivefirst from a staff memberand then after that from Mary herself soif you're a staff member you're kind oflike on the go in the building probablyright you're not working in a set officeand you need access to a mobile app sothat's what we're going to show you heresoI'myeah thereso let's say I'm working in the buildingandI'm gonna get a notification about anissueso I get paged in some sense and hereyou can see that there's a high priorityissue you can get the idea that there'sa water leak in the kitchen when I clickon it I get access to all theinformation in the app sheet app rightthereand you can see that there's a quickaction button at the top that says startwork that allows me to kind of like youknow update the status of that task assoon as I'm on top of itso everything you're showing us is builtin app sheet the notification the appthe button it's all app sheet correctokayand now I just clicked on that otherquick action button to close the issueand you can see that the app is askingme to provide a little bit moreinformation so that we can document thecase some con some comments but also animage in this case okay and at the endyou can see that the issue is marked asresolved and I can move on to my nexttask if any is assigned to meso now let's take a look at theperspective uh for Mary right she's amanager and she needs to get statusupdatesso she's workingshe's working a lot in emails right andthanks to app she is receiving emailupdates for the high priority issues soyou have one example hereand she has access to really all of theinformation that is in the applicationitself you can see that the status ofthat task is now in progress and so thatallows her to understand what'shappening without even having to open anapp rightum here you can see that Mary is gettinganother email update and same all of theinformation is right therePoint here that is important maybe isall of this is provided by the app sheetsolution uh in this case these areautomation Botssofor those of you who are not likefamiliar with actually we're going to gothrough like a very quick demo of likewhat it looks like how is the appcreation experience and how you actuallybuilt that app we just saw right we'rejust going to stay at the high levelokay we're not going to go through allthe details it's a really cool app Ireally love it that's allso as I mentioned earlieruh getting started with Google sheet islike a great way to start you can seehere that I have the data organized in atable each row is a maintenance issuethe one at the bottom says water leak inthe kitchen which I just showed youearlier and then each column is a datafield like title ticket owner and so onright from there I can go and create theapp this is just a normal sheet rightyou're just in sheets and then youclicked on that that button in the navand now it's created an Appand that gets me to the app sheet editoron the right side of the app sheeteditor you have the app it is the actualapp it's workingand on the left you have the settingsthat control what the app looks like andwhat it can do and so here's an exampleyou know I think that the UI the userinterface of the app is not veryfriendly for the staff members theyshould be able to see a number ofimportant Fields about each of themaintenance requests and so I can changethat right from there in the settings onthe left and as soon as I make a changethis is reflected on the right in yourappsowith these three short videos we'veshowed you how you know you can get amobile app in-app notifications for thestaff members but also Gmail support uhfor the manager all of that provided byappshi and it's no good app editorso cool I love it I love it and one ofthe things I really want to emphasize isthatyou got all of those capabilitieswithout needing to write any code yougot it simply by clicking on create appand it all sort of came with app sheetyou need to configure a bunch of otherthings and say I want to enable this andI want to enable that and I want to likeget access to this thing it all getscreated for for your use if you chooseto use it sort of out of the boxokaythat's sort of the high levelit works today Ia little bit now and talk about what'snew in app sheet and we're going to talkabout what's new from two differentperspectives the first is going to bethe perspective of the person creatingthe app the app creator and then thesecond we'll go to is the perspective ofthe of the app user the person who'sactually using the thing that is createdsolet's start with what's new for ourcreatorsnowwe're going to talk through these thingsthey're cool I'm excited for themhold hold your horses here we're goingto talk about them at a really highlevel we're going to talk about somedetails about them and then we will seea demo so as we're going through themand you're like what am I going to seeit when am I going to see it just knowthat I'm going to talk through threethings and then you will see the demowith that context in mind what are thosethree things well first as Arthur showedI don't know a minute ago uh it ispretty easy to go ahead and create anapp even directly from a Google sheetplug in your data source you get an appa few minutes or a few seconds later andif you choose to customize it you canactually get a deployed solution a fewminutes laterbutyou did need to have that data sourceyou started with a data source youstarted with a table that had theheaders and the columns and it sort oforganized the way you needed it to bewhat if she gave you no code tools fornot just the app customization part ofthe the process but really the entireend-to-end journey of translating yourbusiness process the thing you do everyday that may or may not be in a tableTranslating that into a real functioningcomplete applicationwhat if you could build an app simply bydescribing in your own words what thebusiness process problem or opportunityis that you're looking to addresswell I guess you can already todaythanks to duty infjit yayum so you've heard already about doing adialogue so twit Ai and app sheet isreally about offering a whole new way offor option creators to build their ownsolution right simply by using naturallanguagedual AI harnesses the power of Google'sAI models andyou know it simply lets you describe inyour own word or in your own words theprocess that you want to digitizeandit's going to take that information andtranscribe it into app requirements andcreate an initial app so that you canreview it and then further customize itso it's pretty simple you start with adescription in your own words of theprocess you have probably a couple ofclicks we're going to see that a littlebit later and maybe some few a fewquestions to answer and you get to anapp you know within minutessothis is starting to roll out in a coupleof weeksand it will be available to allworkspace customers with a core appsheet licensesvery exciting okay as I promised we willget to that demo in just a minute butbefore we do that two other things Iwant to mention starting with well howdo you customize thatuh that was just created well there's alot of tools available in app sheetright now to customize it but I want tohighlight some changes some improvementsdare I say we've made to the app sheeteditor tool with the Advent of visualediting which is really the introductionof true point and click editing ofapplications and we think this wasreally important and as dare I say againessential for us to provide to ourbusiness users who don't want to gowrite code who don't want to gosearching through lots and lots and lotsof customization options and insteadwant true point and click access to beable to update the look and feel andfunctionality of their apps so this isavailable now as well the last thing I'mgoing to mention before we get into thelong-awaited duet demois appshi databases and given theimportance of a quality data source or adata source in general in order toactually get a successful app out theother sideI would be remiss if we didn't mentionapshi databases and what it providesthere so appshi databases is ourbuilt-in data source for app building itis a purpose-built solution to power allof your AI backed apps and it reachedthe scalability and think times thatcome from being built off of cloudspanneraltogether it makes working with yourtabular data easier than ever whichwe're going to see in the demo coming soso soon sorry that was a bit of a falsestart there but it is coming really soonthe only other thing I want to mentionabout FG database is before we actuallysee it is that while it's excellent nowand we're excited to have it availablefor all of you we are making it evenbetter coming soon with some scalabilityand performance improvements to increasetable size so as I said it's generallyavailable to all app sheet plans and nowwithout further adosaid demo Arthur show us these featuresin action all right so do it AI in appsheet is currently available through ourchannel so that's what I'm going to showyou to get startedandlet's see in the meantime we plan thespinner just to like really drum up theenthusiasm for it all right so do it Aiand actually is asking me right from thestart what I would like to have as anappum and so I can describe in my own wordswhat I wantI'm trying to reproduce the maintenanceuh uh maintenance request app and youcan see that do it AI based on mydescription was able to organize thedata into staff employees andmaintenance requests and for maintenancerequests it's suggesting that we'regoing to keep track of title descriptionand so onnow when I look at this there's a couplemore fields that I would like to havethere like I want to make sure like wehave a resolution date on our priorityso I'm asking do it AI to take care ofthat and it is adding itum one thing that I don't like here Isee the priority is a numberyou know numbers are never like a goodthing like which one is the highestPriority One or tenum so we'll fix that in a secondso I've got my app here represented uh Ithink I I like what I'm seeing but I'mgoing to review all of these uh fieldsfor the maintenance request Title Hereshows as as if it's a number so thatdoesn't make sense to me I want this tobe a text so I'm going to change thatdescription is fine employee ID is alittle special it's linking to anothertable the employee table that we sawearlier so that's what this is doingum created app shouldn't be a number Iwant this to be a date or a daytimerightum status I don't want this to be anumber I'd rather this be something thatmy users select among multiple optionsso there's an option for that rightthereand you're still in chat right having achat with the app sheet app that isbuilding this app for you and asking youthese options letting you configure itso cool okay so for priority and Statusduet AI is recognizing that it's missingsome information it doesn't know whatkind of values I want to or options Iwant to authorize and so I'm specifyingthis right there priorities like highmedium low instead of like one two threefour five or whatever it isum shows me these changes they look goodso I'm going to accept thatand I'm back again to uh the summarycard hereso data looks good I know what I'm goingto see and what I want to keep track ofI'm going to move to the next step whichis adding notificationsand I can see that I can get updates byemail for these different tables and Idefinitely want to be aware of changesin maintenance requests so I'm going toselect that seeokayit seems like I can create my app so I'mgoing to do that right nowso do it AI kind of like guided me alittle bit to gather the informationthat's needed and it's gonna thentranslate that into app requirements andnow it's going to build me my app andit's going to essentially drop me intothe app sheet editor where I'm going tobe able to continue on customizing itso here it is on the right this is theapp oh yeah so one last thing thatduetai did for me is creating some mockdata so it's not my data right but thedata is contextual to my app maintenancerequest and all of these seems to bethese are things I would want to repairyeah yeah these are these are repairablethings so now as a business user I maynot be familiar with the interface andyou knowat this point I thinkit's easier to like point at what I wantto change and so here I can do exactlythat I can see what my options are andhere I selected uh edit the view and soon the left what happened is that all ofmy settings for this view were broughtup and I can make those changes and thisis exactly the same thing that I showedyou in in one of the earlier demo solet's look at a different view this is adetail view that shows all of theinformation or for a given recordwellin this case let's just say that the theorder of the information is not is notgreat for my staff members I want themto be able to see information in acertain order that makes sense statusand priority are pretty important to seeyou know right from the go get goso this is how you can customize uh youknow the app using visual editingnow let me show you a little bit aboutthe app sheet database and its userinterfacesoas Rachel said a lot of the benefits oftraditional databases but here you cansee that the UI the interface is a lotmore familiar it's a lot more to youknow we really want to cater to businessusers process ownersand you can see that this informationhere all these maintenance records arethe same ones that we showed you earlierso this was created forthe interaction you had in chat it justsort of deduced that you needed thisinformation built the table for you andnow you have all of these options forconfiguration correctI can change how to group the records Ican even change the value edit the dataright right there through a drop downand one more thing that this Powers isany change in the database getsimmediately immediately reflected in allof the applications and so therefore allof the staff members are always in syncoh my goodness it is so cool I am soexcited that we can share with you alltoday these changes these improvementsto the app making process to make iteven more accessible for anyone who islooking to create an app to do so withthe power of duet AI now I want to talkabout some of the changes that we arebringing to the apps that are createdthemselves so we talked about theCreator experience now let's switch overto the end user experiencenow we talked at the beginning of thisthis session we have here together ourtime here together towards the beginningthat's really importantassess digitization in order for thedigital version of a process in order tobe picked up used and beneficial allthat good stuff but it has to actuallylook like and act like and be in theplaces that your business users want itto be it has to meet users where theyare now getting those solutions that arecreated to people where they actuallywork in their offices on a laptop ormaybe on a larger screen size or perhapsin chat or email or docs or even in thefield on a mobile app and perhaps even amobile app that is Offline that doesn'thave online access getting an app to allthose places is essential in order forit to actually be a replacement to thepaper version of the process in orderfor it to actually work for users so Iwant to talk about some of the ways thatapp sheet has been improving and addingnew capabilities to the way we are ableto help meet your users where they arewe're going to talk about threedifferent ways we're doing this I'lltalk through all three and then ourpattern will stay the same and thenwe'll sort of see it be a live demo soway one number way number one modalitynumber one let's call it that desktop UIso a few minutes ago we saw when we werebuilding an app as well as using thatapp we saw sort of a mobile view of thatapp it looked a little bit smaller alittle bit narrower perfect for a mobiledevice devicewe also have been hard at work onimproving the desktop UI or the desktopview of apps which effectively meansthat apps now look better than ever runbetter than ever give more real estatefor viewing data than they did before soyou can now use your apps on largerscreen sizes and they will work andperform just as beautifully as they doon mobile and very importantly you getaccess to this everything gets a desktopview out of the box so when you createan app that has both a mobile view and adesktop view built in you don't have toconfigure anything to get it to worknext onechat appsapps so speaking of app sheetsautomatically configuring multiple playsplaces you can view appsis another place we are making your appsrun without really any work on your onyour part so if you've been following usclosely you'll know that this is not atotally new announcement but I would beremiss if I didn't mention it herebecause I do think it's such a powerfulway of getting users access to apps orapp-based Solutions perhaps is a betterway of saying itin the context of the work that they'realready doing not making them go back toapp sheet or go back to a mobile app ora desktop app to to interact with thecapabilities but actually get itdirectly where they're doing their workand in this case that is in chat so whata chat app is is it is is as it is anapp sheet view that is configured to runin chat and is configured to run andchat without any configuration in gcpwhatsoever so if you've built chat appsbefore you know it's sometimes a lengthyprocess to get chat apps to run in yourdomain internal environment the chat appprocess for appsheet involves a singleclick to get your app sheet app to runin chat so we're very excited about thatyou should give it a try if you haven'tyet the last one I'm going to mentionbefore we go to that long-awaited demois docs now desktop and chat are veryuseful surfaces to interact withappsheet apps sure but they're not theend of the story so we have been hard atwork in making app sheet apps run betterand run overall in ways that align withthe needs of those three billionworkspace customers mentioned just a fewminutes ago so smart chips werementioned in the session before this ifyou happen to catch it and you may haveused smart chips before there are thoselittle chips that you see when you pastedata into a dock you know a date chip orif you embed a slide view you'll see thelittle slide convert to a chip and thenthere's some data unfurled about itbeneath they really give you sort of thecontext of the thing that you're lookingatwe are very excited to share with youall today that we are hard at work inmaking app sheet views configured to runwith smart chips as well so you will beable to include an app sheet link a linkto an app sheet view in a dock and itwill convert itself magically magicallyinto a smart chip where you will see thestyling sure but you also get to unfurlthe data and see the detail view of theactual information that you've posted inso that you can get that contextuallyrelevant view of whatever app it is thatyou happen to have includedall right then what time yeah let's doit okayuh we're going to start with Google ChatMary's team right you'll remember Marywas getting updates by email let's lookat what it can be with Google Chat andhow they interact uh with with the withthe chat appsothis is going to start inside a space achat space that Mary created for herwhole team okayumso first this is their space firstlymaintenance chat and whenever there's anupdate to a high priority issue they getthe update right there it's available toeveryone and once again all of theinformation is provided right from hereumone thing that I like about this setupis that you know if something comes upif I need to follow up for some reasonthere's a chat space where I can askquestions to my teammate and that kindof information about like you knowwhere's the repair toolkit maybe thatdoesn't need to be in the app so it'spretty convenient everything's in oneplace but it all makes senseand herepeople just received another updateabout the issue that was now resolvedand again you can see all of theinformation including pictures rightfrom thereso Mary is getting her update here butshe can also call the app and say lookat the data maybe there are some highpriority tickets that she's not aware ofso she's going to check from right thereand you can see that there's a number ofitems here and there's a new one the thefirst one soap in the bathroom so we'rejust gonna check what it isagain all of the information isavailable right there it's a safetyissue someone might slip and it's not asign so Mary can just do that right fromthere the ticket owner should be someoneelse so she's going to assign it tomilesand she can go through all of thedifferent issues whether they're highpriority or unassigned but you can dothat right from there instead of havingto jump into a specific appnow staff members use uh you know mobiledevices a lot but Mary maybe at the endof the week when she needs to review allof the issues that were solved I wouldrather work on the laptopand sowe're going to show you here a reallyreally short demo of what the UI lookslike uh on the on the web browser andhere you can see the information isorganized at this point she's looking atthe tickets that were resolved in thelast seven days she can filter to lookonly at the high priority issues thewater leak again is there she has apreview but if she wants more detail shecan dive into it and really see all ofthe available informationand maybe the point that is important isthe app you know on desktop uh webbrowser comes you know there's nodifference with the mobile app you justcreate one app and you have bothessentiallyumlet's not talk about how appsheet isgoing to work with Google Docsso let's imagine that you know I have towrite an escalation report to someoneMary has to and she's providing a lot ofinformation in in a document but shealso wants to make sure that the data inthe app about the specific issue isreflected so when she clicks or when thereader clicks on the smart chip they'llbe able to have access to all of thedata about that record again you can seeeverything right from there and the datawill be refreshed uh you know if thereare changesnow how do you create that smart chip uhwell it's pretty simple you just copypaste the URL to the view from your webbrowser press Tab and there you have itI'm glad that was a lot of that was abig URL yeahthat's nice that's great so again all ofthe information is thereand then the one nice thing like maybeat the bottom you can see approve andreject balance the reader they don'tneed to go to the app they can just dothat right from the Google Doclove it thank you Arthur sowe've shown you lots of ways that we aremaking it easier for creators to createapps lots of ways that users caninteract with apps where they are doingtheir work I want to finish our demofilled presentation here todaywith asomething newthat we want to share with you all abouthow we are hopefully using AI to make iteasier for users to interact with thoseapps as well sosort of Interestuh as a as a maintenance repair personwe're so grateful to you for doing thathowever I imagine typing into yourmobile device on your app with yourgloves on because you probably weargloves to repair leaky sync and you knowyou've been like fiddling with thewrench and everything it's hard it'shard to make all those little clicks andto type all the little lettersbe great if you could just not if youcould just maybe like talk to your appand say Here's the information I want tocapture or here's what I'm noticing orhere's the thing I need to make happenand not have to take off your gloves anddo all the fiddling and make all thathappenwhich is basically exactly the featurethat I'm very excited to announce now tobe a little bit more concrete about whatit is we at app cheat are very happy toshare with you unstructured data captureso what this does is it does kind ofexactly what I just said it allows youto take spoken audio and app sheet willtranscribe it parse it and validate itthen input it into the form fields inyour app that you have created and fromthere it's normal app data it willtrigger any automations that you havecreated it will sync across all usersand it will work just as if Arthur therepair person had typed in all theindividual changes himself however itgot there because a user was justnaturally speaking in natural languageto the app so this is one of thosethat's best seen so let's look at afinal recorded demo here yeahso I want to create an escalation ticketand there are Fields like request reasonI could put a lot of information thereand I don't want to type it becausethere are more Fields below so what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to call duet Aiand tell it what I wanted to populate itwiththis is for an escalation I'm requestingthat we contact the landlord ASAP andlet them know about the issuethe reason is I expect fixing this willrequire some significant work thelandlord approval and an assessment bytheir insurancewe mitigated the issue by shutting offthe water supply on the area right aboveI'll follow up by September 1stso I just said what I wanted it torecord right and now duid ai isanalyzing that information extractingthe relevant information and putting itin the fields that I had currentmitigation requestfollow-up date and reason and thatallows me to double check all of thatinformation is correct right it didn'tlike extract something wrongand now I'm back to the Forum and I cansee that you know some fields aremissing maybe I didn't specify themand that's it save and I'm doneso yeah doing AI should help uh also inappsheet apps it is so cool I just Ievery time I see it I'm like oh my goshthis is real I can't believe this isreal life it is so cool to see that inaction and especially for folks withum field workers or or sort of on thefloor use cases I think that is going tobe incredibly incredibly useful nowbefore we wrap up here I know we arealmost at time I just want to say one ortwo words about why all of this uhcitizen development and access tobusiness data to sort of update areal-time synced across all devicesshould not be deeply terrifying to allof our I.T folks in the room and all ofour folks focused on compliance andsecurity and governance because appsheet has been built from the ground upwith governance and security andscalability in mind we do this acrossfour areas security governancemanagement and monitoring and we havemultiple features in each of those areasthat help you from an I.T perspectiveestablish a governed ecosystem controlShadow I.T protect data via policiesrobust policies and usage monitoring andgive access to audit logging as wellall of this together allows you as I.Tto feel comfortable empowering yourcreators to build Solutions buildapplications on top of business datathat are secure and compliant and freeyou all up to do the mission criticalwork at hand we've made this easier thanever to understandright now it has a bunch of templatesand decks and trainings and things likethat to help our I.T focused folks toget a better sense of how to actually dothis within your own app sheetdeploymentsnow I want to wrap up here very quicklyI do see the folks in the back of theroom being like Oh my gosh quickerquicker so I'm going to do thatbut next stepflea here how do you actually get accessto all this stuff if you're not actuallycustomers today oh what do you do how doyou use these tools that we've talkedabout here and the ones you'll findonlineI am excited to share with you all thatwe have uh done the work to giveeveryone give almost everyone inworkspace access to an app sheetsubscription so previously if you didn'thave an app sheet subscription availableto you through your workspaceentitlement you did have to purchase onehowever in order to expand theavailability of these tools to workspaceusers and more creators we're nowincluding the app sheet core plan withalmost all workspace editions so we'revery excited about that and if you wantto learn more aboutsheet or any of the capabilities thatwe've talked about here today or how weat appsheet our with this coreentitlement making it while keepingsecurity front of mind please come andjoin us at any of the other sessions yousee here there's a bunch of them there'sa bunch of other times and places wherewe're talking about app sheet come andjoin us down in the hive floor talk tous in the Showcase area there are lotsof places and opportunities to learnabout app sheet and we would be glad totalk to you about any of the things wetalked about here or probably a wholebunch of things we didn't so with thatactually if you want to try do it AIfeatures you can also do that go to theinnovators you can try itreal life In the Flesh it's gonna begreat Okay sofor joining us here today
