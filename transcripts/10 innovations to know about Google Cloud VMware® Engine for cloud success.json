seriouslyshow of hands how many of you are usingVMware products vsphere NSX awesome yesI see a lot of hands perfect and howmany of you would like to move yourVMware workloads to the cloud or areworking on that yep I still see a bunchof hands and wouldn't you like that tobe as easy as possibleI'm sure you would so we are here toshare 10 innovations that we love aboutGoogle Cloud VMware engine and they canhelp you with your Cloud successso let's get startedI'm Cheryl young I'm in productmarketing at VMware and I live in theBay Area here so welcome to our townum I like to go on Hikes with my dogsand I like to visit the nearby beachesyou can see I've got two dogsum during Colwood yes we were fosteringpuppies and of course we had to keep oneso we have a little covid puppy we callherum and so I think Mike you've seen themon Zoom probably I haveum and here in San Francisco when we docome to the city I like to see some ofthe shows let's see I saw A Chorus Linea few months ago great show so do enjoythat if you if you stay in the city afew daysand Mike hello everyone my name is MikeFink I've been with VMware for aboutfive years similar to Cheryl and I'mlocated in Gaffney South Carolina any uhHouse of Cards folks anyone see thatshow yep it's actually a city and umit's uh kind of like they portrayed itin a movie or the show Believe It or Notum Mike Charles I have quite a few petsenjoy hiking and uh really lookingforward to getting startedsounds good so let's dive in what you'rehere forwe are going to cover a brief overviewof Google Cloud VMware engine or you mayhear us call it gcveand we will also then get to the 10innovations that we want to cover we'llgive you a few takeaways some resourceswhere you can learn more and we'll pointyou to a couple of other sessionsso let's Dive Right Inall right Google Cloud VMware engine orgcvewhat is this service so it's bringingyou vmware's Enterprise grade sddcthat's vsphere vsan NSX hcx all of thesebringing them to you on the Googleplatform and so what's great is you canconsistently run your workloads whetherthey're going to be on-prem or in Googlecloud or in your hybrid cloud and so youcan you can leverage it across all oftheseum all of these cloudsuh you can run those productionworkloads andum you can also connect them to otherGoogle native services so you'll see onthe right of the diagram all of theseother Google services like bigquery andyou're able to connect with a lowlatency direct connection to thoseservices from gcvewe'll talk a little bit about about thatmoreum and also on the top of the diagramyou see a bunch of VMwareapplications as well so you can it alsointegrates with all of these otherVMware Solutions like Horizon for vdilike site recovery manager for Dr Aryawhich was vrealize for your Cloudmanagement so a lot of other tools plugright in and you can leverage them thatwhole solution the service is sold byGoogle and Google Partners it's alsosold by VMware and VMware Partnersthrough the VMware Cloud Universalprogramand it is considered a native Googlecloud service you will find it rightthere in the console with all the otherGoogle cloud servicesand it's available on demand or in oneyear and three year subscriptions sogiving you a lot of flexibility there uhand as you consume the service it canburn down against your overall GoogleCloud commitmentit's got great great potential rightparticularly if you have a huge GoogleCloud commitment exactly all right sowhere is it available it's available allaround the globe we're in it's in 18regions now and expanding uh all thetime and you'll also see that it's inseveral zones they have an addition inseveral regions they have additionalzones oh these little asterisks here soFrankfurt London Sydney Virginia theyhave additional zones uh in thoseregions to provide additionalavailability for your needsuh let's get into the top use cases so Iwant to share with you how our customersare using Google Cloud VMware engine sofirst off Cloud migration of course thisis a a big reason people are adoptingthe cloud they want to move to the cloudthey want to get out of the data centerbusiness uh they don't want that burdenof having to manage the infrastructureand so they want to go to the cloud andLeverage The flexibility of the clouddata center extension you may have aneed where you're you're just runningout of capacity in your on-prem datacenter right and you need get capacityfast so you can do that with an on witha data center extension use caseleveraging the cloud for that additionalcapacity or maybe you you set up Labsum for people to do training and youwant to stand up those labs and tearthem down stand them up and tear themdown it's a great way to Leverage TheCloud to do that as welluh Disaster Recovery now that's a reallynatural fit for the cloud uh you don'twant to have to build an on-prem replicaof your on-prem site in another on-premsite right so you can Leverage The Cloudto give you that Disaster Recovery infact a customer I wanted to share ADT aleading security solution provider theyare leveraging gcve for their Drenvironment and they were able toaccelerate their Disaster Recovery cutover Times by like 95 percent I think itwasum and they went from five hours down to15 minutes so amazing amount of effortwas saved and it just lets them be muchmore much more agileuh the next uh use case appmodernization so we know you want toleverage uh modernizing things right youwant to modernize your infrastructureyou want to modernize your applicationsand Google cloud and VMware allowmultiple ways for you to do that one ofthe ways is by running VMware tanzukubernetes grid on gcve and that letsyou run both your VMS and containers onthe same infrastructure and there arealso lots more possibilities to um tomodernize connecting to Native servicesand we'll we'll touch on that as welland then last vdi your virtual desktopinfrastructure so many many customersare trying to leverage the ability towork from anywhere rightand deliver to their customers fromanywhere and so a vdi use caseleveraging gcve is perfect for that thisis actually another benefit that ADT thesecurity solution provider experiencethey were able to scale up their vdienvironment in just 10 days to supportget this 20 000 employees remotelyduring the pandemic so uh it's a greatway to get things moving quickly byleveraging gcve in the cloud sorryall right we're going to cover this iswhat you're here for right we're goingto cover 10 Innovations we've selectedthem we love them and the order we'regoing to share them with you is in theorder you're going to encounter them inyour Cloud Journey okay so that's howwe'll we'll travel through the cloudJourney hereall right Innovation number 10 here'sour countdown this is VMware CloudUniversal now why did we choose this asone of the Innovationsthis is something we love VMware CloudUniversal is how you can um get thisservice through VMware and it is a wayto financial we have Financialflexibility okay so one of the benefitsis that you get the cloud accelerationbenefits so that means you can leveragethings you've already invested inon-prem you can leverage that investmentand get financialumbenefitby going through VMware Cloud Universalum so it's a great financial benefitthat's not the only financial benefitalso because you can subscribe to thesolution in one year and three yearsubscriptions rather than just being ondemand you have a way to be get a betterFinancial uh benefit there as well solots of different ways that this helpsyou and because you can move yourworkloads so rapidly to the cloudthrough this programum there you don't have to refactor soagain it's all a win-win you're gettinga better TCO you're getting a betterflip Financial flexibility so that's ourInnovation number 10.what is next ah let's uh let's starttalking about some of the tools that areavailable to help you guys make themigrationso believe it or not as a VMwareemployee I'm going to tell you the worlddoes not start and end with VMwaregcve is a very full-featured VMwarestack but there's a large catalog ofintegrated third-party solutions thatare available to add on and extend thatthatso you see some of the tools called outhere hcx SRM carbon black somethird-party Solutions like zerto andveeam these are all integrated directlywith gcve and it allows you as apotential customer choice to pick theright migration the right Dr the rightsecurity tools for your particularapplication and your needswith the exception of hcx which we'regoing to dig into it on our net our nextInnovation these are all options in gcbeso you're not paying for them if youdon't need them and you're selectingwhich tools are right for yourparticular applicationalso just a note this list is not exexhausted there's a lot of applicationsand solutions that are available insidethe Google catalog that integratedirectly with gcve we just wanted tocall out some here but additionalsecurity container Solutions networkingSolutions as you start to go through theGoogle catalog you'll find that the listis extremely Broad and very deepallowing gcpe to service most customerswithout the need to bring in any thirdparties or external solutions that youhave to integrate yourselfso now we're going to talk about how wecan extend the on-prem data centereasily and this is where we're going togo in a little more depth on hcxjust want to make sure my slide'sbuilding outso we're going to dig in a little moredepth here so hcx is included by defaultwith every gcbe installed and allows youto easily pick up and migrate workloadsfrom on-prem to a variety of bothinternal and external VMware basedSolutionsin effect htx allows your environment tofloat it can float over your on-premgcve potentially other third-party Cloudproviders and move the virtual machinesin the workloads between thoseenvironments pretty much as you see fitas an administratorposition the right workload in the rightCloud at the right time and we'll dothat with no downtime or reconfigurationto the VM that's basically the promisethat HDX brings and what most of ourcustomers are leveraging today to dotheir migrations up to into and out ofgcveso a lot of customers are takingadvantage of this to do their migrationsand we're seeing customers who aremoving hundreds of VMS per week weactually have a couple of different casestudies Cheryl can share some with usbut moving hundreds of VMS per week andif we compare that to what it takes torefactor we're just in a dramatic it'sdramatically different right so we canpick up and move these VMS very quicklyand easily without that refactoringthat's typically associated with a moveto a cloud provider and sure I think wedo have one that we wanted to talk abouthere sure I'll throw out another exampleso a car 4 a leading retailer theyleverage hcx to move their workloads togcve and so they were able to do thatvery rapidly just within minutes theycan move a bunch of workloads and thisway they weren't there was no disruptionfor their customers or for theiremployees which is really key HDX makesit makes it that easy one thing that'swhat we lose one paying when we do anhcx migration just putting a very finepoint on it we lose one ping the VMdoesn't go down there's no reboot wejust move it straight from wherever itis into the GCB environmentso as you're going through this processyou're bringing up these migrated VMSwouldn't it be nice if the environmentcould scale alongside this right so youstart out today maybe we bring up athree node cluster as we start tomigrate VMS in and we're doing thatextremely rapidly it'd be nice if theadmins didn't have to watch and gothrough the process of scaling thatinfrastructure that's exactly what thisInnovation is talking about so Autoscaling gives us that you know we canbasically set triggers inside of theenvironment and say at a particular CPUlevel at a particular Ram consumptionparticular amount of storage consumedscale the environment bring new nodes inand do all of that automatically thisdoes work in both directions so we canscale up or scale down automatically aswe're bringing workloads into or movingthem out of gcvethis is really a really impactful formigration because effectively what we dois we put the environment on autopilotwe build it out we set those metricsthat I talked about a moment ago and wethen start doing the migrations and theenvironment on the side on the Googleside it just handles it it continues toscale as you continue to migrate makesure you're making the best use of yourassets and you're not over provisioningfor where you'd like to be in a month orsix months you're provisioning correctlytoday letting the auto scaling takeadvantage taking advantage of thatfunctionality and that flexibility goingforwardso let's see we're up to Innovationnumber seven here Mike let's talk aboutthat differentiated networking andsecurity a key a key reason people wantto go to Google Cloudany network admins X Network admins inthe room I'll raise my hand I was oneif you're trying to figure out if aNetwork's operating well what what's oneof the first things you do well firstthing I'm going to do is Ping 422 rightnext thing I'm going to do is I'm goingto Ping google.com the reason I'm goingto Ping Google is because Google isextremely low latency if we just pickrandom websites and we start looking forthem google.com is generally going to beone of the lowest that's that'savailable out thereso what we're trying to do here and whatwhat Google brings to the market is gcverides on exactly that same network thesame network that delivers Google searchand Gmail and all the other servicesthat you guys use love and experiencethat low latency connection you leveragethat same network to deliver gcbeso one of the use cases where thisbecomes extremely impactful and you'realready touched on a little bit is whenwe're talking about vdi so vdi isextremely latency sensitive the closerwe can get that to the end user thelower we can get that ping time thebetter their experience is going to beby riding on that Google Network andthat you can actually see it called outthere the private Global Network thatGoogle has built we're going to be ableto deliver ping times that arepotentially the lowest certainly in thelower half of what's available in themarket today when we're looking at cloudservice providersfinally one thing that's not shown herebut I'll call out very quickly weactually have a whole presentation wherewe go in this Google doesn't enablemulti-vpc technology inside of gcveagain it's kind of a depth in-depthtopic but effectively what it means isif you have multiple departments and youwant to share those resources across theDepartments gcve makes that very veryeffective and cost effective for you soyou don't have to deploy entire clustersto service different departments insideof your environmentlet's also hit on some of thecertifications so uh VMware and GoogleCloud continue to add more and more uhindustry certification so you can meetyour stringent compliance needs and it'snot just in certain regions so it'sGlobal and so you can see like in theAmericas HIPAA is a big one uh in Europegdpr and they're hitting um manyimportant certifications around theworld and adding and adding to itconstantly this is the slide that drivesour marketing department crazy becauseit seems to change like every two weeksso as Cheryl said this list continuallyupdating and Google continues to addmore and more certifications globally asuh as we go forwardokay so let's talk about integratinginto some of the Google native servicesand I'm going to keep with the themeHere of the world not starting andending with VMwaremany of our customers are making use ofthe extensive catalog of services thatare available in Google CloudAIML Google container platforms Googlecompute engine bigquery some of the AIthings that we heard about in theKeynotes today all of these services areavailable for direct integration intoyour GCV environment via private lowlatency connectionthis is particularly applicable wherethey went with something like AI or mlwe're doing huge data ingestions rightwe have a tremendous amount of datapotentially in a relational database weneed to move all that data into an AIMLplatform could be hundreds of terabytesof data that were moving back and forththat extremely low latency high speedconnection makes that very valuable andvery easy for customers to get that dataover thereand now kind of back into my morecorporate sanction messaging Google alsohas a catalog that Cheryl touched on alittle bit of VMware services andsolutions that can be added on top ofgcbe horizon or our vdi platform whichwe've already mentioned but also AriaNSX load balancer you guys may know thatis AVI or sd-wan solution SRM the thecatalog is extremely extensive for theadd-on services that can be stackedaround gcvealso it's worth mentioning those VMwarevalid those VMware Solutions are jointlyvalidated and supported by both VMwareand Google right so we launched themjointly with Google and we stand behindthem as both companies to resolve anyissues that you guys may haveand I think we're going to talk aboutCarrefour yeah so far for the realTaylorum they not only do they move theirworkloads to gcve they tied it in to anative services like bigquery and otherAi and they were able to provide apersonalized shopping experience forcustomersum so they're really taking advantage ofthat direct connection that you get fromgcve to the Google native servicesI think Google also announced somethingnew in the AI space here they did uh soI don't know if you guys saw but Googleannounced uh chat assistive AI thatintegrates with some of the VMwarecapabilities that we have surfaced ingcve so things like asking chat to tellyou what's making this particularcluster hot or what workloads have thewrong version of VMware tools you knowanother way to interact withparticularly as we scale beyond what asingle virtual Center can look at orwhat some of our management tools couldbe very impactful for customers and makeit more natural to interact with andmaintain your VMware environment yeah sothey they announced that's in the worksfor gcbe administrators to be able totake advantage ofdown the road yep they did all rightInnovation number five so Google managedpatching Hardware updates so what'sgreat about the service so it's it'sprovide we're providing VMware as aservice on the Google platform andGoogle is going to take care of all theupdates the patching the hardwareum so you can get out of that themanaging the the infrastructure burdenyou can get rid of that and and we'vehad customers say great now I can focusmy people on more value-addum capabilities and features anotherthing to note is that Google's providinga dedicated uh cluster design so you'renot having to share your compute or youruh RAM with others you are getting thatdedicated for your incidence of gcveum and also you can use your standardVMware tools to manage all of thatumand there's something new here too ohwell also VM uh Google is providing thisat a 99.99 SLA in a single region sothat we've got a great SLA there butthey have announced something new so thethe nodes we have right now are calledve1 and they're they're announcing apreview of ve2um I just love the product naming thatwe had ve ones now we have V2s thatseems to make a lot of sense to me yeahso uh for for anyone who hasn't heardabout this uh the existing node that wehave today 36 cores 768 gigs of RAM theve2 nodes are roughly three times thesize so we're two terabytes of ram 72cores and various storage sizes so it'sgoing to allow customers to size denotea little bit more appropriately to theworkload that they're running and thatresult bringing down your cost also it'sgoing to allow us to service the verylarge workload so Honda databases anytype of in-memory databases very largeworkloads we can now service them insideof gcd using these new node typesfantasticokayum and we've kind of touched on this onea little bit but the consistentmanagement experience so one more timeI'll this will be the last I promiseanyone know how to use vsphere webinterface NSX manager couple hands okayum good because those are exactly thesame tools you use in gcve so it's sameinterfaces same command samefunctionality that you have todayon-prem and there's no relearningnecessary to make that transition fromwhat you're doing on-prem into your gcbeenvironmentbut there's a lot more here right soit's not just those tools as you can seecalled out Google extends what you cando you with the VMware management toolsso maybe we want to do something likedeploy an entire what would we wouldcall a physical Network deploy thatNetwork programmatically deploy hostsprogrammatically a new VMware cluster ina new region maybe we're going to useterraform or Google's apis to do so afull complement of options are availableso we can use things like power CLIvsphere web client NSX manager whateveryou guys are familiar with and usingtoday we can do that in Google but wecan also extend it by the commands thatGoogle has available via the gcloud APIall this allows for repeatable resultsso we can do everything Soup To Nutsprogrammatically which gives us fasterdeployments and lets our customersleverage the existing skills that theyhave today with their VM wordsokayum so this is a quick one uh privilegeescalation what this is basicallytalking about if you remember back I wastalking about integrating third-partySolutions into your GCV environmentmaybe you're using something like veeamor zerto or some other VMware specifictool today what privilege escalation isdesigned to do is it allows you toescalate your privileges basically toadmin at vsphere.local it's not exactlybut let's just call it similar to adminof easter.local to integrate third-partySolutions into your environment againreally the message here is theflexibility that this offers to you asan End customer to use the tools you'refamiliar with using today inside of yourdata centers and extend into the gcveenvironmentwell we're getting close Innovationnumber two we are close and this isgoing to be my last one before I turn itback to Cherylum but and this is a relatively newannouncement but you've probably heardabout it there's a tremendous amount ofstorage options that are available forcustomers inside of gcve so maybe youhave a huge infrequently accessed datawarehouse so maybe we want to put themon Lower performance lower cost storagesomething like Google file store highperformance VMS that might have lowlatency requirements vsan is included inevery gcve environmentso maybe we also need to encrypt thestorage layer so Google KMS which canintegrate directly into vsan and makesure that we have private keys that evenGoogle VMware nobody except the adminsinside of your company have access toalso we have Google cloud storage soless frequently Access Data could bevery interesting and services inside thecloud Marketplace that can leverage thatcloud storage including very recentlyannounced some of the GoogleIntegrations via protect to do thingslike backup and put them on Google CloudStorage again reducing your Roi reducingthe amount of things that you have tomanage as an adminand then finally NetApp Cloud volumeswhich uh you know now offered inside ofgcde and is available as both a vmfsdata store and for guest VMS this allowsyou to scale your GCB environmentstorage that your VMS are actually usingand scale that independently of your GCVenvironment again reduces the TCOreduces your Roi over timeand Google also made anotherannouncement here so they've announceduh storage only nodes are coming as wellwhat's a storage only node Cheryl sothey're they're letting you not have topurchase all you don't have to pay forCPU all these things Ram you can justget the storage that you need so we'restill it's still view sand uheffectively what we do with a storageonly node is we say the CPU and RAM ofthat node is not available all thestorage is available it reduces the costby you know some percent it'ssignificant and allows you to scale vsankind of like how you would scaleexternal storage still getting that youknow private access and the latencybenefits that are associated with vsanstore so pretty neat and certainly agreat option for some customers I thinkwe might have another one here what Ithink we might have another one anotherannouncement could be[Laughter]so you guys may have heard I I didmention NetApp CVS NetApp Cloud volumeserviceum that is becoming a more uh it'sbecoming more ingrained in Googlemainstream so you're going to start tosee that surface higher up on thecatalog it still is great optionparticularly when you need that externalstorage capability that's associatedwith NetApp and need to tie it back toyour GCB instanceawesome all right I think there's a drumroll nowall right we are down to Innovationnumber one on your Cloud Journey so youwant to transform right VMware andGoogle Cloud allow you to have many waysthat you can not just modernize but alsotransform uh we realize that you knowrefactoring all your applications intocontainers that's not really feasiblethat's not a good Roi so we offer someguidance you may want to uh look at thethe ones with the most high impact rightthe ones that may be on a rolling basisyou want to refactor some things toContainers other ones you want to justmove into the cloud leverage gcve andthen tie those in directly uh havingyour them close to your container-basedapplications uh some ways to do this iswith VMware tanzu kubernetes grid youcan run both your VMS and yourcontainers on the same infrastructureyou can also leverageum some of the that direct connection tothe native Google cloud services and tiethose into your traditional applicationsso there's a lot of different options inhow you can transformand uh that brings us to the end of theInnovations uh on this one I'll just sayreally quickly uh you know in my role inCheryl and your role as well I mean wedeal with a large percentage of thecustomers who are consuming and workingwith gcpe and one thing I will say isthat many many customers who are nowgreat gcve customers started their CloudJourney with the idea that I'm justgoing straight to Containers or I'mgoing straight to function I'm done withall these VMS I'm done with all thisWindows Linux infrastructureand the reality is it's a very difficultoperation so what a lot of customers aredoing is they're taking a step back andsaying how can I save a lot of moneytoday how can I get to the Cloud makethings work faster leverage all thatFinancial benefit today and then movewhere I want to move in the future maybethat's tanzu maybe that's kubernetesmaybe it's some other native services soit's become a really big use case for usto kind of come into these Googleaccounts that are having trouble makingthe migration and accelerate thatmigration with some of the technologythat we just spoke about todayawesome thanks Mike all right we want toleave you with a few key takeaways sowe've covered the 10 Innovations on yourCloud journey and we want to just umhighlight that you don't have torefactor all of your applications rightjust to move to Cloud that that's notwhat you have to do here and it's veryeasy to manageum the solution because you're used tothose tools already same tools youalready use uh with vsphere and you cansave time and money there's manydifferent ways we we covered a lot ofdifferent ways that you can do thatespecially with VMware hcx making themigration very seamless you can leveragethat and what's what's underlyingeverything the powerful Google Cloudnetworking and hardware for yourbusiness critical applicationsnow we want to also share with you someresourcesso here's a great slide to take apicture of it points you to our TechZone which gives you technical videosand blogs our product pages uhthere's webinars over here gcbeconversation demos so there's a wholebunch of materials hopefully you can seeand get a good picture of that[Music]"
