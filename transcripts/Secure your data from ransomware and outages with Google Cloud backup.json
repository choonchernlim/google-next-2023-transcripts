name is Vijay tiwariI'm on LinkedIn let's try and figure outif I can get you to find me connect withme and then I first posted the sessionstuff go like it and try and get morepeople to join in all right let's go somy name is Vijay tawari last name istears and Tom he is in Edward W as inWhiskey A is an apple r as in Roger I isin India all right let's gocome onlet's see if we find folksfound me not yetnot exciting enoughI'm on X sorry Twitter two my handle isV Tango in case you want to chat with methere as well happy to sort of engagewith you thereand again the selfish interest after allclearly you're interested in backup andDisaster Recovery we represent thebackup and design Disaster Recovery teamso we want to continue this dialogue notjust about decision but beyond this aswell so that's part of the reasonall right let's seesomebody no yeah okaytwo peopleuh yeah awesomethat's great awesomethree awesomelet's keep goingso what's been the most excitingannouncement for you from nextbesides the AI stuffanyonewant to take a crack at itcome on there's been so much stuff thatwe've announced or is it too muchanyonesorryoh kubernetes Enterprise that's awesomethat's great we've got a story for thatthat's awesome that's great what elsealloy DB but alloy DB was GA before thistooawesome that's great yep what elsewhat about sorryI pick a pardonoh do it okay that's that's AI okayawesomeAI by definition is exciting so I'mtrying to find other exciting thingsor elsesorryof compute instances awesome that'sgreat yeah very cool feature what elseanybody elseall right now let's talk about AI whatabout AI was excitingcome on let's godo a terraform integration that's prettycoolsoum yeah that's good yeah we've beenexperimenting obviously with barredinternally quite a bit and do it tofigure out uh how it is and you knowI'll tell you an example ofhallucination so way way back early westarted in the ask bar to tell us how doyou backup a a VMand it spit out some beautifullyformatted text click on this button thatbutton problem was there was no suchbutton that existed so it took a littlewhile for us to sort of get the modelright and it's a work in progress but wemade a lot of you know sort of work goneinto sort of getting that air so and ofcourse it's a work in progress so use itgive feedback and continue down the pathit's one of those things that will onlyimprove if all of you use ityeahand then I discovered an awesome featureyesterdayso Radha and a couple of us were atdinner yesterday it turns out my watchsaid that I was exercising on a bikewhile I was having dinner that's thekind of watch I want awesomefor 35 minutes it said I was havingrigorous exercise on my bike whilewearing dinneryou knowall right anybody else any last-minutethoughts on what other thing wasexciting while you're herebut we really are grateful that you comedown to the conference it's really greatto be back together in in person we'vedone this virtually over the last fewyearsto be honest this is my first attendancephysically with with the next as well soI joined Google in 2020the the day Google shut down for remotework or rather we were not allowed tocome into the officeso I have the dubious distinction of nothaving gone through what is called as aGoogle tech immersion in in Googlebecause they didn't know what to do withus when we joined Google so I learnedthrough all the people who join in theteamyes all right so that's great so lawyerwanted to come on board let's getstarted thank you so much reallyappreciatemm-hmmhello Vijay thank you so much maybe Ishould ask people to uh join my LinkedInso before we start welcome to Arc 200 Iwant to get a sense of who's in theaudience I I see maybe some gke folksover there who are excited aboutEnterprise so first question who here isresponsible for securityoh that's a lot of people okay who hereis responsible for backup and Recoveryall right and who here is in devopswell this is a great representation ofso many different functions and the goodnews is we're going to have contentthat's relevant to all of you so staytuned you will get to hear from Vijaysoonall right so let me introduce our folkswho are sitting over here so we have awonderful customer Dr Radu banabik whocomes to us from cyber Haven he's aco-founder and VP of engineering of thatcompany now this is a very excitingsecurity company startupand he'll tell you a little bit moreabout this company but one of the thingsthat I found very interestingis that they use data lineage toidentify suspicious activityand in fact to do that they havedeveloped a trillion scale graph to lookat all the data moving throughout theEnterprise so later on those in uhsecurity area can talk to Radu and askhim their questions about his companyand Technologynow I'm Laura Finkelstein you can alsofind me on LinkedIn I'm responsible foroutbound product management for thebackup areaVijay tuari who you have already met isthe person responsible for all productmanagement for our data protectionproducts and you're also going to hearfrom Radha mature who's within vijay'sorganization who will show you somedemos later and she's responsible forthe Google Cloud backup and Dr productsoI want to give you a map of what we'regoing to be talking about today so youknow what's coming I'm going to talk toyou first about an overview of the itchallenges that you probably are facingmaybe not all of them but many of themthen I'm going to be turning it over toVijay who's going to go into a deeperdive first on the Google Cloud portfoliofor backup as well as a specific productcalled Google Cloud backup and DrthenVijay is going to bring on to the stageRada who's going to talk to you aboutshow you how we defend against maliciousactivities and just talk to you aboutwhy backup is so essential for securitythen Vijay again is going to Deep diveinto the backup for gke product againsomething very interesting to the devopsfolks here and Rod who is going to joinus on stage because he's a super user ofgke and backup for gke and he's going totalk to you about how it's benefited hiscompanyand then finally we're going to justsummarize and give you a chance to askyour questions so with that let's getstartedso you might have seen this slide hereif you went to the presentation thatSachin Gupta gave earlier but reallywhat I wanted to point out is eventhough you're coming from disparatefunctions on top of that you have amyriad of different workloads thatyou're responsible forand so this is kind of trying to capturethe Rai workloads there's traditionalworkloads what we're going to talk abouttoday is security and availability forthose workloadsso I don't need to tell you that data isthe lifeblood of your organization andthat making sure that it's secure andavailable is very difficult becausethere's so many potential risksthat are there to take that data away ormake it unavailablenow what I wanted to mention is thatbecause Google also believes thatsecuring your data is so criticalGoogle has released in the last year twonew data protection products that you'regoing to hear about in detail todaythe first one Google Cloud backup and Dris a product that covers a large numberof workloads both on premises and withinthe cloudand then the other new product is aproduct built specifically for gke thatdeeply understands the nuances andconstructs of your gke clusters andnamespaces and it helps you to back thatup and recreate clusters exactly likethey were beforeso let's talk about some of thosechallengesfirst and foremost many of youparticularly security folks are worriedabout cyber attacksnow the problem here is that theseperpetratorsare going to be able to get in on anysurface so you can't defend across allsurfaces so inevitably they're going toget in and so this is where backups comein to be able to recover from thisproblemnow the interesting one to me is I'veheard from numerous customers that theirbiggest worry is user error the old fatfinger and so this is the problem thatyou are most likely to bump into andproblematically you could be not onlylosing your data but to potentially thebackups associated with that so we'regoing to talk to you about how you candefend against that as welland anothernon-malicious riskis that you do a software upgrade or youchange your pipeline for your CI CD andsomething breaks and so you really wantto immediately go back to the last knownstatethis is really critical to keep yourproductivity and your businessoperations goingand then compliance the ability toprotect that data to keep it around aslong as you need to and to potentiallyput it in the location you need tobecause of other regulationsthe last two that I want to mention isyes occasionally Google goes downand in those situations you're going towant to have backups that are in adifferent region so you can just bringup your operations and continue in thatnew regionand then finally there are some positiveaspects of backups that are not aboutdealing with disasters and that is usingbackups to really optimize youroperations to move the operations to abetter place for performance or costoptimization as well as use your backupdata to develop your applications andensure that they're working before youroll them out into productionoops am I going the wrong way here I amhere we goso what you're going to hear from Vijayand the team todayis really how do we address these issuesthat we talked about on the previouspageone of those approaches you're going tohear about is how do I deal withmalicious attacks and two of the thingsthat we are delivering capability wisewithin our backup products is first ofall immutable backups so no one canmodify encryptchange corrupt those backups they arethere to be rolled back when you needthemsecond and very importantly indeliblebackups this means that no one candelete them either externally orinternally it might be accidental as wetalked about from a user error or itcould be a bad internal perpetrator sowe will talk to you about how we preventwhen you don't want those backups beingdeleted by anyonethe indelible backupsthe other thing that we're going to talkto you about is how these Googleproducts integrate with other Googleproductsto allow you to look at unified loggingunified identity and access managementand the ability to really manage yourworkloads and resources in a centralizedseamless wayand then finally you're going to hear aswe talked about earlier how you usethese products to improve youroperations that proactive approach andso with that said I'm going to turn theBaton over to Vijay who you've alreadymet and he's going to dive into thatthank you so much Laura reallyappreciate it so first of all just toyou know I represent the work of over100 Engineers so thank you so much forattending and it's it's really great forthem to see the passion that you have inthe space so thank you so much for thatso what I'm going to do is I'm going towalk you through how Google thinks aboutbackup and Disaster Recovery right sothe couple of major things that we thinkare fundamental to this which I thinkLaura has already talked you through I'mgoing to talk you to some of the corecapabilities that we have in theplatform which provides backupfunctionality to you rightso this is a bit of a you know a bigchart but let me walk you through itright so from a customer standpoint youcan interact with Google cloud in avariety of different ways through theAPI through the gcloud command lineinterface through the user experience orthrough other automation tools liketerraform right they layer on top ofwhat we call as Google apis all thosetools all those UI layer on top ofGoogle apis on the back end what we havedone is all the core services that wehave whether it is persistent diskswhether it is alloy DB whether it is gkewhether it is bigquery cloud SQL we areworking with all of those teams forthose teams to build core Primitives forbackup into those products right so ifyou are a kind of a customer who doesn'treally need a finished backup andDisaster Recovery product but acquiredcomfortable of scripting your way andsort of orchestrating backup acrossthese individual Resources by all meanswe have a solution for you right that'swhat represents the absolute right sideof this chart right you can orchestratein scripted GL you know command line itwhatever it is that's available for youto use however you know that works forsome customers but then ifyou're able to take and apply backuppolicies across multiple differentelements that constitute your workloadsI've come across many customerswho are basically saying look I've got abunch of compute that's running in gkeI've got the back end infrastructure forthat application sitting in a cloud SQLdatabase and I want to be able toconsistentlyin a back up policy which says I wantyou to be able to back up the computeand the database consistently at youknow take it dailyand retain it for seven days take itweekly and retain that for 24 days andtake a monthly and retain that for ayear that's what Google Cloud backup andDr as a product is designed to do rightso it augments the functionality thatyou get with the core Primitives butlayers on sophisticated capabilities ontop of that like reporting you know uhsophisticated monitoring sophisticatedalertingright a couple of things I want you tothink about when you think about GoogleCloud Backup backup and Dr soduring the session or maybe after thesession go log into the cloud consoleand go look for backup and Dr it'sactually a product in Pantheon you'llwell not sorry Pantheon is the internalcode name for the UI the UI you'llactually see the backup and Dr productthere and what it offers you there isthe ability to backup a robust set ofworkloads that we support today so ifyou're running on GCE VMS you're runningon gcve you're running sap Oracle MySQLSQL Server we support backups for allthose workloadsmission isAsics right you've got a VMwareinfrastructure on premisesand you want tothat up into gcp you can retain like theprevious seven days of backup locallybut you actually want to back up youknow long term retention into gcp that'sanother scenario that we support as wellrightthe benefits that you could get withGoogle Cloud backup and Dr is that it'sit's Google so that means all thesecurity benefits all the I amcompliance all the rbac integration youget as a part of Google Cloud backup andDr rightum and obviously by virtue of beingGoogle Cloud backup and Dr it affords usthe opportunity to give you Googletooling for what you get accustomed tousing when you're using Google so youcan walk up to the cloud monitoringconsole in gcp and you'll be able to seeall the monitoring data from backups ifyou want to be able to get an emailevery Friday which says tell me all thebackups that fail during the week we cando that and Cloud alerting can send thiscommunication across multiple differentcommunication channels right so that'sthe benefit that you accrue from usingsomething like Google Cloud backup andDr Fairso now that I've actually sort of givenyou a high level view of how we thinkabout the core platform Primitives andhow Google Cloud backup and Dr actuallylayers over the same Primitives right tooffer you an end-to-end backup managesolution let's hear from a customer whoactually has done this in practice rightsoumFrancisco is the CTO of latam Airlinesright one of the largest Airlines in inthe latim domain and they have been he'sone of those Visionary leaders who tooka big bet on cloud a while back and theyare almost done if not already done inmigrating all the data centers off intoa cloud platform right and they took abook back with us early on so without adue let's roll the video you can seehear from him himselfcan we play the first video pleaseyeah oh sorry can you hear the cue thesound if possible Lata Maryland is theleading airline in South America with afive-star Global rating an early thisyear we achieved to become a 100 percentcloud Airline by closing all of our datacenter and moving all of our warlocks togcpthe criticality of our operation and thesensitivity of our data make it veryimportant to have a solid backupstrategyeasy bdr is our trusted backup solutionfor our gcp workloads gcbdr help us meetcompliance requirements and satisfiedregulatory Theory obligation for dataprotectionwe protect a broad portfolio ofoverloads more than 1 000 productionwarlock with those and of componentsrunning in four regionsthe ability to Define and enforcecomplex policy for frequency retentionand expiration of backups and theflexibility to apply different policiesbased on criticality of the warlockshelp us achieve compliance across worldsanother relevant aspect using gcddr isthe ability to consistently managebackups for multiple gcp workloads for asingle pane of glassbe it our Oracle database learn whereinstances or our GCE VMS and Cloud SQLinstances we can manage Backup using thesingle productthe fact that the service is an integralpart of the gcp platform makes it veryeasy to operate by governing access andmonitoring backups operation via thecloud monitoring serviceslast but not least working with gcp andincorporating gcvdr backups as part ofour Cloud adoption has been a truepartnershipthere is a great responsiveness to ourneeds and support always is availablewe value our partnership and willcontinue to deploy additional workloadsleveraging gcbdr backupsthank you Franciscoso the one thing I want to share now isthat we really believe that today'sransomware threats makes your backupsystems whatever it is a key part ofyour security posture right security isbackup and backup is securityso when you're actually already in yourattack unfortunately it's a little toolate so I'd encourage you all to takebackups if you don't want to use GoogleCloud backup and Dr that's finedefinitely back up your data right todaythe threat of ransomware is isexceptionally high and I'll actuallyshare a story of how it happened withone of our customers rightthe next thing I want you to think aboutis this framework so there's a reallygood framework by nist which is anorganization in the US which hasactually put out a framework on how youshould think about your cyber resilienceposture right and there are two things Iwant to highlight in this Google has alot of products that cover many manyaspects of this not the least of whichis mandiant another services companythat Google hasthink about how you want to protect yourworkloads and think about how you wantto recover your workloads that is whereGoogle Cloud backup and Dr and all thebackup capabilities that we haveinvested in fit into your overall cyberresilience posture okayso now let me walk you througha Cyber attack that happened right sothis was a customer they have about 30plus factories in many locations each ofthem actually had about a three or fournode VMware cluster they had a centralheadquarter location which was aslightly larger VMware cluster they hadabout 900 VMS spread out across these 30plus Geographic locations okay and theywere actually backing up and sendingthey had a local copy for quick recoverybut they're sending their data back upinto gcp for protectionand then they were hit by a verysophisticated attack some of you mayhave heard of that attack Vector it'scalled black cat slash Alpha V right nowthis is a highly sophisticated attackVector that actually originates in beingable to use Active Directory GroupPolicy objects to then distributepayloads into various elements of yourenvironment and then from there theybasically go inyour data right and then the surface athreat to you and say look if you needyour data back I'm gonna you're gonnahave to pay me some money to actually uhyou know get me to decrypt the data orthey also have a threat of being able torelease that data to the public domainso this customeryou know unfortunately didn't have avery sophisticated xdr system right sothey were not able to detect the attackvery quickly but as soon as it wasdetectedyou know the good thing they were ableto dowas to very quickly because theiron-prem environments were highly suspectat this point of time by virtue of thefact that we had backups in gcp we havea Google Cloud VMware engines servicewe've been able to very quickly bringthose backups back into gcp very quicklyright within days we were able to bringout all those 900 VMS right and thecustomer was back and operational andthenokay I'm sorry I didn't want to talk toyou but soumget operationaland so that's something that was areally benefit that they saw out of thiswhile they went and cleaned up theiron-premises environment so here you knowthe act of being able to air gap alogically air gap and keep their backupsin a separate location was highlybeneficial because they didn't weren'timpacted by the you know the the thedangers of the ransomware encryptingtheir backups themselves so that was ahugely valuable proposition not theleast of which was to mention the GCVitself offers some very sophisticatednetworking capabilities which allowedthem to firewall plants and they broughtthem back up so they were able toactually utilize that isolation theywere able to use hcx Network extensionsto make sure that they were able to spantheir networks so there were some reallycool things that they were able to do inthe context of responding to an attacklike this okayso now that we've done this what I'dlike to do is to bring on Radhachandrashekhar mathur and she'll walkyou through some more details of theactual product that actually help thiskind of a recovery rather thank youhello everyoneum I'm very excited to show you thetechnology that makes cyber recoveryfrom backups possiblelet us begin I think we want to bringour demo video onin this demo I'm going to show you howto backup on-premises VMware workloadsand recover them in a logicallyair-gapped environment in Google CloudVMware engineto support this use case a backupappliance which is the data movercomponent of the backup and Dr serviceis deployed on premises along with theworkloads that need to be backed upthe other component is the Managementconsole which is what we're looking atthis serves as the management plane formultiple such backup appliances and thisis where backups are configured thefirst step is to create a backup planlet us go look at an existing backupplan which has policies for schedulingretention and storage the first rule inthis backup plan is for snapshots whichare stored on premises in a storage pooland here the frequency is every fourhours and retention seven days thesecond rule is for cloud backups theseare stored in a Google Cloud Storagebased onward pool in the cloud andbecause they are intended for long-termretention the you know retention is setto 90 days once a backup plan with suchrules is defined the next step is toapply them to the workloads we do thatin the backup and recover section herewe see the list of compute environmentsand database applications that can bebacked up using Google Cloud backup andDr servicebackup ndr agents are used to back upthis wide range of databases that aredisplayed heretoday's scenario doesn't employ an agentclicking on VMware starts the process ofdiscovering a VMware environment we gavewe Center information selected the ESXcluster then we get the list of VMSselect and group them and apply thebackup planthis completes the process ofconfiguring backup for on-premisesVMware workloadsall the selected workloads are nowprotectedongoing backup operations are monitoredusing the backup ndr dashboard thisprovides information such as job statusprotection status alerts events as wellas storage information across allprotected workloadsCloud backups provide a great safety netfrom ransomwareBackup ndr Service enables recoveringfrom these Cloud backups right in thecloud as Vijay described using GoogleCloud VMware engine let's see how thatworks the first step is to deploy a newbackup appliance which is deployed inthe cloudbecause backups were stored in a GoogleCloud Storage based onward pool the newbackup Appliance can use the on-wallpool which is in cloud and discover theVMS and all the backups that werecreatedwe can see herehow a new backup Appliance hasdiscovered the VMS therefore protectedand their backupsto initiate recovery we select aworkloadand the next step is to select thebackup or recovery point from a catalogof backups I'm gonna wait till we bringup the cataloghere we can see both on-premises uhsnapshots that were created as well asall the cloud backups for this workloadwe can jump to a pretty previous pointin time and after selecting the recoverypoint the next step is to provide thegcve environment information where wewant this VM to be recovereda recovery job gets initiated the jobmonitor shows us its status and oncethis job is complete a vsphere clientcan be used to point to the vcenterwhich is in Google Cloud VMware engineand we can see that the workload werecovered has become available here foruse this is how Google Cloud backup andDr service enables recovery ofon-premises VMware workloads in thecloud using the logically air-gappedgcve environment thatthank you so much for showing us thisdemo what about what are we doing nextin this spaceto shareexcuse me can we switch back to theslidesI'm excited to share how we are takingthis up a notch we saw how to recoverfrom cyber attacks now we are enablingthe ability to do early detection andproactive prevention of attacks GoogleCloud backup ndr is integrating withGoogle Cloud security Command Centerdestructive actions from the backupsystem such as deletion of backupsremoval of workloads from protectionwill be propagated to the securityCommand Centersecurity Command Center or SCC will notonly provide alertsbased on that event but it will alsoenable correlation of these events withother actions such as security breachesthat's pretty cool so let's show youanother demo on how we do this in thecontext of gke we're running a littlebit short of time so could we just moveforward a little bit Cara that would bevery helpful for uswe'll see how to protect for gkeworkloads andthen we will see how to use backup Worldfunctionality to safeguard these backupsfrom ransomwareso we're going to move a little forwardwe're skipping over the part where weapply a backup plan to workloads but welook at an existing backup plan andstart from therewe're looking at the backup for gkeinterface it's a part of the kubernetesengine section of the Google Cloudconsoleis there a network issue but get intothe video you thinkthere are 20 000 of you trying to accessthe network what backup network willsurvive that you tell me thatall right I think it seems it seems tobe we seem to be having some troublewith the video let's see let Kara couldyou try one more try if not then I'llwalk you through this demo in in uh inthe context of the talk track that Ihave for thisall right that's fine let's go on to theslides I'll walk you through thank youso much rather really appreciate it allright all right so um unfortunately wecouldn't show you the demo but what I'dlike to show you is is the followingright so what is backup for gke right werecognize that you know clearly as thedevops movement took uh sort of move tosort of took to ground a lot ofcustomers are coming to Google the homeof kubernetes and adopting gke right butwe needed a way for those customers toalso protect their workloads right andwhat I mean by protect their workloadsactually spans multiple things in thecontext of gke first and foremost iswhen you're deploying clusters in gkeyou want to make sure that your clusterconfiguration is backed up right so weoffer an ability for you to say look Idon't want to worry about data becausemy state is sitting in some externaldata store like a cloud SQL alloy DB GCSwhatever it is I just want to make surethat the configuration of my kubernetesclusters is backed up right so we offerthat ability right we call themstateless clusters we can back it up youcan restore it you can restore itwhether you're doing it for you knowusing it get Ops operation you're doingCI CD and want to be able to you knowrecover roll back to a different clusterState no problem at all another place wepeople see using this is for migrationof clusters from one region to anotherthe next place is obviously in case youwant to actually do have state insidecontainers right so if you've gotpersistent disks that are plumbed intoyour kubernetes clusters and you've gotpods where you want to be able to backup these things we've got uh a a anability for you to be able to schedulebackups for kubernetes using bothstateless and stateful clusters right sowe'll be able to back up the diskwe also offer a hook so if you've gotyou know some sophisticated acquires inalgorithm that you want to run on yourworkload you know tickle this ping thisand then I'll acquire the database thentake the snapshot we've got a sidecararchitecture which allows you to runyour code which acquires is the workloadthat's running inside the containerbefore you actually take snapshot of thedisk right and then obviously we weenable recovery of that within gke aswell right the other thing I'd like youto focus on is actually you know the thethe UI itself so this is the the UI ofgke right and if you actually go seeright here this is backup that'sembedded right into the user experiencefor gke so if you've got a devops teamor developers who are actually workingthrough the UI or through terraform orthrough gcloud they can get a seamlessexperience where you can Define thepolicy and then the developers canbasically just enable the policy and youcan make sure that you know theirworkloads are backed up so you as backupadministrators are not worried about mygod did my kubernetes platform ownersdid they actually back up the Clustersor not right set the policy and it's intheir flow in their tooling right withthere they are right so that's anopportunity ofhow do you try to integrate with theworkloads in fact you'll see us do moreof this with backup and Dr we'llintegrate into GCE we'll integrate intoCloud SQL our goal really is to befundamental to the workload itself ishow you'll be able to backup makes senseall right so I think I've given youenough office now so what the demo wasreally going to show you was this thingin action and more importantly it wasgoing to show you that backup for gkealready has the ability to haveimmutable and indelible backups rightthat means you can put the backup into asnapshot and say I've locked the key Idon't want anybody to delete this backupfor the next 30 days and we'll enforcethat retention period for you right comewhat may it's protected from any superuser nobody can go and delete that basicbackup so that's the capability that'salready available for you to use in thecontext of gke what I'd like to do nowis to invitehe isum you know as as rather uh you knowLaura already introduced him he's fromcyber Haven so go ahead please Radothank you so uh I'd like to firstintroduce the company a product a bitand then we'll talk a bit about how weuse Google backupwe're a cyber security company we're astartup a relatively Midway in thejourney where past series big and closeto CDCand our product protects Enterprise dataand the way it does that is by mappingout all of the movement of the datawithin various locations in the companyand why that's helpful is that by doingthis we can protect data based onlineage so in the context of DLP I knowthat there's some security people in theaudience rather than saying I want toprevent data containing free lettersfour digits and a DOT from going to chatapplications we can say I don't want mydata from the legal folder in GoogleDrive going to chat that's much easiermuch more intuitive as well as much morepowerfulhow that translates to the technicalside is we are essentially manipulatinga very large graph very large minimeaning literally trillions of nodes andon this graph we are constantly doingscans aggregations and modifications itactually modifies thousands of times persecond that's a very tough problem andactually there isn't we didn't find agood way to just take an out of the boxsolution to do all of this dataprocessing for us so we built our ownsystem on top of a bunch of differentServices they are all Google serviceslike bigquery Pub sub bigtableand then we have our own code actingbasically as the glue putting all ofthis data together to form this complexgraph modeland this is where uh Google backup forGK really comes in it makes all of ourwork much easierapplication to utilize core gcp serviceslike bigtable and others and you got atremendous amount of benefit for thatbut tell us a little more about whatbackup for gke gave you and how did ithelp you improve your postureall right so uh I guess the short storywhat I like about backup.dk is that itjust works it goes very deep in gke weare using a lot of Google services so itjust covers everything out of the box ithas deep integration with all of thedifferent resources that we haveit covers everything as the applicationevolves we are still in the early stageof our journey so the applicationevolves very rapidly and that means thatwe are adding new services and mightforget to add backups for thatwith Google backup for gke we know thatwe don't have to have developers or wedon't have to have processes to makesure that we don't forget to configbackups or somethingbackup 4gk does that does that for usthat's really fantastic Radu thank youso much for being a great advocate forbackup for gke but not only that being agreat partner through the cycle of aswe've developed this I'm going to putyou a little bit on the spot and ask youin front of all of these people what isthe next thing you would like us to doin backup for gkewhat I think would make a lot of senseis to have backup evolve from uh purelydoing backups to being more of acoordination service for snapshots wehave a bunch of different Servicesrunning in different projects in Googleand managing the backups around amongall of these different projects is quitecomplex so what I really like frombackup for GK is to become a let's say acoordination module for the disabilityplatform mechanism where we can have aconsistent snapshot across all of theseServices done at the same at a singlepoint in timethat's fantastic thank you so muchradufort here and he's going to bearound here at the end of the session soplease catch him and he'll be able toanswer questions for you thank you somuch really appreciate it all right so Ithink first of all I apologize for thevideo not playing up for the for thebackupsession uh I will uh point out one morething we will make sure that the demo isrecorded and available to you so therecording of this session will have alink to the video that you can play forthe backup for GK dma as well right soyou've seen variants of this slidealready the key takeaway I want all ofyou to member is that local cloud hasinvested deeply in making sure you havebackup functionality to protect againstransomware at every layer of the stackme as the owner of the backup and Drproduct utilize the same apis that youhave if you want to directly go to thecloud SQL API the by bigquery API thepersistent disk API it's all in yourhands if you want to do it but thenwe've taken the pain to make sure thatwe can give you a finished
