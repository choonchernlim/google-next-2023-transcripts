talk about how you can makemoney by using apisand this session is going to be allowedby your CFO all your expenses will becovered immediately so this is the firsttime I'm going to talk about how you canmonetize your assets using apismy name is Jay burchella I'm the productmanager for RPG I've been with avici foralmost four years and I've been in theAPI space for almost 10 yearsI'm really excited about this topic Imanage a lot of opposite data productsand conferences and more intention isvery close to my heart and I work withhundreds of customers across the globeand I help them to monetize their apistoday I'm going to have aone secondI'm really delighted to share stage withone of the Google's longest earningpartnerumfunded by Google Ventures and RPGcustomer above all they use Marketplaceorientation product and 400 and CEO ofRocket Lawyer rocket liar is onlinelegal services company I don't want tosteal the Thunder from Charlie soCharlie is going to go back and starttalk about their company and how they'vebeen successful with RPG then I'll comeback and started explaining about thewhole process what are the challengesthat customers are faced the startupsare facing when they are trying to scaleand they're trying to monetize theirvalues assets on it in the end we aregoing to have some key and a sessions soif you want to have questions comeplease come to the stage and we can takesome key and here after the session I'llbe here for a couple of minutes then weare going to be at the startup launch sowithout further Ado please welcome mejoining uh Charlie Moorethank youwell thank you Jay uh you you'redefinitely a hard act to followum it's uh it's exciting to be here uhtalking aboutuh one of my favorite subjects so apisare core to our business strategy uhreally moving the flywheel uh it's a wayfor us to externalize and be a forcemultiplierum for our entire business and ourmissionso at Rocket Lawyer we make the lawaffordable and simple for everybody uhyou know everybody should know I mean Iusually talk about being a recoveringhigh-priced lawyer you know I was aSilicon Valley lawyer before I startedthe companyuh you know charging hundreds if notthousands of dollars an hour uh moststartups can't even really afford thatand so our mission is to make lawaffordable and to make the basic toolsof Justice affordable for most peopleJustice isn't you know whether youwhether you go to jail and that's agreat thing Justice for most people iswhether you can put things in writingwhether you can have contracts for yourbusiness whether your business can beincorporated have the benefit of limitedliability protection uh whether you'rewhether whether or not as an employee ata company you know what better way toget the benefits of Affordable LegalServices than to get it as a benefit ofemployment and we're very proud thatevery Google employee for exampleGoogle's one of our longest standingcustomers every Google employee getsRocket Lawyer as employee benefit aswell as every stripe employee in everyuh sales force employee and about athousand other companies so apis areCentral to this strategy of how weexpand our each by going to ourcustomers where they are whether it'sbecause they're employed somewhere orwhether for example they're a customerof of another cloud service we want tointegrate with them uniquely also withRocket Lawyer we're a global company youknow it's difficult to make law a globalService in an integrated fashion theincumbents typically would go acquireyou know here's the legal documentcompany in Germany or here's the legaldocument company and the Netherlands orwhat have you but I'm very proud to saythe rocketler has expanded organicallyoutside our homework in the UnitedStates again using our API platform ourTechnologiesinstead of doing this sort of hodgepodgeall around the world and so as a resultone in four French citizens can getaccess to rocketlord through apartnership we have with covia which isone of the largest Insurance Groups inFrance it has about 11 million peopleinsured in the United States Adobedocument Cloud now has integrated RocketLawyer apis and about one in nineAmericans has registered with us andcreated a free account with RocketLawyer and about a million people havepaid accounts with Rocket Lawyer somethrough their employer some throughthere through API partners and some thatwe acquire directly so why apiswell the first thing I'm going to say isI I see a couple of our senior engineersin the audience Chris and Brian and youknow these guys are what it's all aboutthank you guys these guys actually wrotesome of the talking points that I havehere soum uh it's fun for me to to basically beup here and explain things that thoseguys do but why apis because it makespeople like Brian and Chris moreeffective uh at Rocket lureum why apogee apis will let me tell youwe started uh initially uh by creatingour own API Gateway and I know BrianCruz are both around for that we wecreate our own API Gatewayum as sort of a proof of concept butthen once you know you're the dog thatcatches the bus once you get you knowcustomers like Adobe or customers likethat who want to be third-partydevelopers on yourum platform uh that your homegrown APIor at least for us it just wasn't goodenough so I mentioned uh our partners inFrance large French insurance companyour own homegrown API platform we knowisn't isn't going to cut the muster forthat over the long term so we'll betransitioning that partnership over tothe apogee apis as well one of thebiggest things that for me as a CEOum was concerning was securityuh and so I would say probably the twobiggest issues are security andmonetization you want to make sure thatuh especially in today's world you knowI even saw yesterday there were somehacking attempts going on at thisconference soum you want to make sure that you haveworld-class security as you sort of uhbecome successful or at least as our aswe became successful and maybe I shouldswitch aside at this point but as webecame more successful it had more uhdevelopers interested in our apisespecially uh the bigger companies bigyou know the global 1000 size businessesinterested the due diligence that thosecompanies do is uh world class and soyou know that with a partner or we knewthat with a partner like apogee we weregoing to need a front door that had beenthrough that a million times and maybethe partners used for their API gatewaysfor their own Services as well and it'sgoing to be best in class so that wasanother big reason for us of why apisbut also why apogee is a particularpartnernow what what do what do we get out ofit or what does a partner get out of itwell there are multiple facets in theworkflow that we support the mostimportant of course is legaldocumentation for us so creatingcontracts with machine learning withassistedmaking it easy for somebody to justanswer a few simple questions and thenuh that the software does the rest solegal documentation is at the core ofRocket Lawyer just like it is in a legalsystem in the worldnow around that we have other serviceslike uhrocket sign digital signature service wehave other services uh like rocket filewhich enables you to do filings withgovernment agencies like incorporationstrademarks Etc we also have ask whichenables you to ask a lawyer all of thosecomponents of of the overall workflowmay be useful to an API partnerdiscreetly individually and so with ourAPI Gateway we're able to then separateout these distinct services use apogeeas the front door and then enablepartners for example we have a number ofprop prop tech companies these arecompanies that supportlandlords and folks that are in therental property business what's thething what do they need they need leasessometimes they need to evict tenantsthey need attorney advice they needdigital signatures so they can reallyget an A La Carte menu the the partnersfor us that are property tech companiesfor example they can get an A La Cartemenu and say yeah I want to power leasesin the state of Nevada or wherever usingthe Rocket Lawyer API and it comes veryeasy for them to then create a front-endintegration for their customers butusing our back-end document service forthat they can do the same thing withrocket SCI and over time we we nowbuild everything API first and let meyeah so we build everything API firstthis is a good example right leaseagreement everything API first so all ofour uh we have our service orientedarchitecture we reallyum for the last 10 years made that anabsolute discipline in our uh in in theway we build in the way we architecteverything and as a business that sellsdirect to con consumers ourselves uh Imentioned we have about 30 millionaccount holders in the United States sowe sell direct to Consumers ourselvesand then we have API Partners what'sfantastic now is we can tell our APIPartners what you are operating on whatyou're building your uh front-endservices on is this are the sameback-end services that we build on topof as well and so that gives the partnera lot of confidence it also cuts down onthe maintenance and supportthat we have to provide as we are ableto uh operate on exactly the same backend infrastructure that our that ourpartners are and using the exact sameapis as our partnersummaybe a couple more words about whyapogee and then I'll hand the mic overto Jay let's see if I have even no okayso I'll stay here for a secondum again security I've talked a fairamount about but monetization soum with with a partner like apogee weautomatically have a way to look atum at least three different ways tomonetizeuh what we selltypically most of our larger Partnersnow will elect to have some sort of ratemetering approach so we have a number ofpartners that we that have this sort ofrate metering approach either Based ondata or based on some actions that arebeing powered by the API we also havePartners uh that are on a revenue sharesort of approach and then uh in thefuture you know we may uh we may or maynot look at some of the other uhmonetization sort of Hybrid models thatI know apogee's working on but again itmakes it a lot easier for us to have apartner that um that can supportmonetization and security the way thatwe want to do it so I'll give it back toyou andthanks thanks Charlieso let's find out new ways to uh Revenuewith Refugee API management not onlyjust generating Revenue how you can evengo ahead and started scaling and todaywe are going to go and talk about howyou can make your first dollar withoutspending and time isn't it great sothat's what we will be focusing on it sothe scaling your value is very hardproblem so the data shows like 42percent of startupstrying to uh lack of the right Marketfit you can have a great team an amazingfunding great board and great technologybut if you don't have the right Marketfit product and if you go to market withonly one or couple of hero features thenyou will be started struggling with theright Market fit yes you can go aheadand start it selling but can you scaleit can you add the value to the entireMarket on that can you go to the globalon that can you adjust different marketson that one with yourum similar with your limited experiencesthat's one bigger problem and the 74 thepercent of the customersthey struggle to capture the market bygoing the premature scaling sobefore they even started analyzingMarket they started investing on theentire scale the infrastructure on itlike the way the Charlie was tellinglike okay they started building theirown API Gateway and then they realizedthat one okay this is not our corecompetency why don't we just go aheadand piggyback and the specialist producton it so that is one example on that oneso what is your core capability and whenyou need to go ahead and scale it andthe customer acquisition cost from thelast five years has been increased by 50percent on it so these are the some ofthe major challenges that startups arefacing under so how do we solve this onethe foridentifying the lack of right Market fitI didn't say the what is the valueproportion on that one it is not thefinished service whether you arecreating a website whether you arecreating an app or wherever you'recreating your own service on that onewhat are the underlying value proportionassets you have that one let's identifythat one we will walk through step bystep on that one the second one iscome up with an approach like a try morefail fast how quickly you can go backand started developing on that one andcan you go back and start a reusableconference and can we go back and startit using aum the uhthe framework that is being offered bythe cloud providers online and also inorder to increase in order to reduce thecustomer acquisition cost can you goback and started partnering withdifferent customers on the differentpartners on that one especially in thedeveloper ecosystem so can you go backand start it offering your services intosomeone else's experience on that one socan you go back and start integratingwith like Banks and finances or somethird party crms is all it available soit can go back and started integratingwith themso in order to do that so we laid outthe fourth simple Foundation four simpleways you can do that one is expand yourproductso your product is not the finishedservice that you are offering with oneor two hero features on it it is amobile application so your productcannot be just mobile application onlybecause there are a lot of details thereare a lot of value assets that ispowering your app so you need toidentify that so whenever I go tocustomers about talking aboutorientation they ask me like okay I havethis data what do you want me to go backand start it uh how do you want me to goback and started exposing on that firstyou need to info what are the key valuepropositions that your product has beenin the second one is acceleratedevelopment with standard protocols onit so go back and start it and stop youdeveloping everything with proprietaryand try to reuse the standard ways ofaccessing your data and capabilities andAPI is the key here and third one isenhance your product offering byintegrating with third-party services onthat so there are a bunch of third partyservices that there so can you go backand start doing that for example PaymentProcessing so can you go back and buildyour own Payment Processing or can yougo back and start using like a stripe orpaper or something like that one plusone is always greater than two and itworks great in this scenario and thirdone isand hence expand your customer rageby integrating by integrating with thepartners on it sothere is a famous African saying if youwanted to go fast go aloneif you wanted to go far go togetherplant thus Partnerships can help you along way so they can help you to go andaddress the market that you cannot goalong on thisso let's find out what is your validdisk assets on that one so in this caselet's take a simple applicationso you created one simple applicationand in this scenario I will take an appthat create that does the translation soit does the three translations one ittranslates fromtext to different language say text tospan English to Spanish or it can takeEnglish word to Spanish language or itcan take a English document andtranslate to Spanish documentation it'ssimple so you can go back and startoffering as a translation service onthatonce you do this yes you can go back andcreate an app and start offering toConsumers that's it that's the marketthat you're going to go ahead and sowhat else you can go back and startoffering more so is there anything elsethat can I can come back and start itmonetizing on that one so let's identifywhat are theum core value assets that your productreally brings on that one so and firststarted identifying and how what are thecore capitals here the core capabilitiesin this scenario is the translationservice the text voice as well asdocument translation service that is theone the second one is what data you arereally presenting to the back to thecustomer on it so can I go back andstart monetizing on that one so whatdata your community is contributing toyour applications are that so can you goback and started using the community onthis so when you started looking at thatthen your product is not only offeringas a single solution to Consumer it canall you can also go back and startedselling the data to a particularindustry on that say for example Healththe translation for healthcare will becompletely different for media thattranslate some of the Lexingtondictionaries that you use for aparticular vertical you can monetize forthat or you can also go back and createan apis where your community they can goback and give you the feedback to you soif any translation problems thenCommunity go back and give you thefeedback on that and also you canleverage this community developerCommunity or user Community they canleverage user Community to translate onbehalf of you so if your engine is notperforming well you can go back and usethem as mechanical type they can do itfor you so these are the multiple waysyou can identify the data so once youidentify this capabilities now bring allthese cabled as an apis for thatthen the apis are going to be front doorfor your businessso now all I've Sharontill now you had only one solution whichwas a mobile application the languagethe translation mobile application bydoing that now you have multipleapplications one is the app and also theAPI products so your app can go to youroriginal business case but your APS cango to wherever your partners can go sothat is the that is how you go back andstarted solving the market fit problemon it so couple of examples for that sowhat you can expose with the apis so APIis whenever people talk about APS or Ican expose the data so I can go back andgive the data in Json reality that isnot an entirely true I know that's verymajor cases on thatthen APS you can also expose the yourtechnology through API sometime so myfavorite API and I always call likeTesla free APS which failure so I camefrom Telco background I have partialitytowards Julio so tillio they offerentire Telco functionality in form ofAPs an amazing ABS on that the samething for payment processing stripe isone example and also uh one of myfavorite customer and super successfulthrough pubg is AccuWeather so wheneveryou see any weather related informationin a web any website the chance of thatwebsite is being powered or an app beingpowered by AccuWeather on this and a lotof students also use the RPC AccuWeatherAPN is so a key whether they sendweather related information to thecustomer on it not only recently uh APSare being used not just to expose thefunctionality not just to expose thedata and also they are using for viraltyalso so the Shopify is one of theexample on that so you can expose theapis so that they can go back andstarted exposing their products that isbeing sold through Shopifyhow do we go back and convert your APSinto channels of Revenue so now wecreated API product it's great now wehave okay now how do I how can I go backand start making money so Jay you saidso many things now show me the moneyright so once you create the API productso I'm busy uh is the API management howmany of you use the RPG as of now pleaseraise your handsgood thank you so now once you createthe APA productum through appraising then you packagethose API paths what is the API productthe opposite DNA is we treat everysingle AP as a product so every time wetalk about APA we call like APA productit's a digital asset for any digitalasset the couple of characteristicsright it's a definition of how the APIthat product really works how to use theproduct and how tosell it how you can go ahead and pricethat one so RPG offers the you can goback and create AP product and weprovide the framework we provide thetool set so that you can set a priceplan for that how really wanted to goback into that we can deep dive insidethat later so once you started offeringAPI product to customers throughdeveloper portal thensomebody of the partner or developer isgoing to start consuming inside theirservices or application so we're notreally stopping there so obviouslycollects tons of data through this flowso we provide analytics with fried graindetails and that we provide multipleways ofanalyzing the traffic and who are thecustomers are using on that the latencyperformance the revenue which geographyis being used which app is being usedthat what are my popular apis uh beingused which application is being my heroapp and how do I go by whether thisprice plan is working or not how am Igoing to go back and start fixing theprice plan or can I kick up the newmarketing campaign all these 90 adsbeing covered by FZso for a minute let's start thinkingabout like outside in like I said beforelike whenever I meet a customer most ofthe time they ask like hey I have thisthis Assets in my backyard or my umdatabase I wanted a go ahead and exposethis one for a minute you need to goback and started thinking about andstart with the customerso if you always started thinking withyour assets you always will be ended upgoing to the one or two markets but ifyou started really thinking about thecustomers okay where is the market andhow many ways we can reach the customerso if if you started thinking about thecustomer then you started thinking aboutokay can I go back and address all thesecustomers with my application or myservice or can I go back and startedpartnering on that one so that is howyou started thinking about theum outside in then once he startedidentifying okay these are the 10services that I need to go back andaddress these are the 10 service that Ineed to be partnered on that then youcreate an APA product so once you createan API product then as an APA Team allyour responsibility is all about likeprovide a better API design and makesure the customers developers are goingto be started using on it and alsostarted creating a demand for your apistreat APA product like your finishedproduct on it so provide the betterdocumentation and engage with the userand drive the demand for thatnow let's start talking about how do youpackage uh apis into products on it soin apa monetization is a feature in RPGand we have hundreds of customers usingthe product so once you create APAproduct then we have a feature calledtransaction policy so we will allowdeveloper API provider to pick andchoose what the API transaction has tobe monetized it's not that like wecreate AP product we are going to goback and started monetizing every singlecall on that so we'll by default westarted offering but we also offer youthe benefit of like pick and choose whatAPI product is being monetized and whatAPI product has been not monetized andalso you can evenchange the value of transaction by thepayload size also soif an APA call is giving like someamount of data then you go back andstart charging a dollar if another APIcall is giving like y amount of data youcan charge differently tooso once you create the API product thenyou can go back and start it creatingthe price plan I will get more detailsin the price plan it's very exciting onethen once we started offering then wewill give uh once the transaction isgoing through the gateway then westarted doing magic here we starteddoing the real time majoring and westarted doing the real time enforcementsay for example if there is any if theyexceed their quota say for example likeyou're offering thousand API calls for100000 API calls for hundred dollars amonth so once they reach that quota thenthe next AP call will be blocked or incase of prepaid customers and if thebalance is low then we are going toblock the next API call on that so wewill ensure that we are not only justdoing metering we will also do theenforcement alsoand everything is great but in the endyou really need a bill right we havemultiple tools multiple APS out oninternal apis so that you can go aheadand generate the invoice on that inaddition to the billing apis we're alsointegrating with a looker and so using alooker RPG customers they can go backand started generating reports andinvoices then you can send theseinvoicesthe Second Step here is standardizeaccess to backend service what do youmean this standardizing access tobackend service on that everythingwhatever the services that you areexposing whether that is internal orwhether you are really reaching theexternal customer or whatever theexperience that you go back and startedcreating and make sure you ask yourbackend services using apis by creatingapis you will have a better control withthe help of RPG API management platformit improves the developer experiencesand it increase the facility andInnovation and it improves the securitybecause RPG is really good in handlingauthentication authorization andauditing purpose and also it will helpyou to scalebecause RPC works with the features onload balancing and caching so it willhelp you to scale it scale tooalways try to use third party servicesand third partyumproducts on it so in order to do thatyou really do not need to go back andstarted using their apis like that so wehave a great product called RPGapplication integration so if you havedata CRM data and Salesforce or sap soyou can always go back and start it weexposed bunch of connectors so thoseconnectors uh RPG application sorryGoogle application integration platformit connects those third boardapplications through connectors thenthat is automatically with seamlesslyintegrate with your apis that withlimited efforts you can integrate withyour apis then your API is not onlyusing your functionality and it can alsogo back and started using third-partyservices too so for example tracking soyou can integrate with FedEx or you canintegrate with UPS services on that soour connectors really helps on that sothis is where your solution as well asthird parties Solutions can take you tothe next levelwell the last one is the how do we goback and solve the customer operationproblem for that you really don't needum huge Salesforce to do that so inorder for you to sell your API productsall you need is simple developerdeveloper portal RPG offers three typesof developer for portals one is thebuilt-in integrated developer portaleasy to use and the second one is uhDrupal based developer portal and whereyou can if you are handy with the Drupaldevelopment and you can go back andstart creating developer portal but ifit really insist to have your own portaland we do provide the entire APImanagement apis so that you can buildyour own fancy developer portal too soonce you develop the develop one of thereason why developer portal is reallyfamous is it will help you to reduce theonboarding efforts by 10 times this isthe data that we received from ourcustomers on that one a good developerportal will help you to onboard thepartners on that like AccuWeather theyhave hundreds and hundreds and thousandsof developers they have it so they'vebeen doing amazing job on that and alsoum developer portal really helps you toengage with your partners on it so forexample if you create an API productengage with your customers throughsample code and Sample applications onit good documentation real-time feedbackfrom your partners on that forums youcan also go back one step above and youcan even use that API developer APIproduct information and portal as amarketing tool for younow let's talk about like you createdum you created APA product and youintegrated with the internal uhthird-party Solutions now we created adeveloper portal so how do I go back andstarted showing like how the customerreally comes back and started using soRPG offersvariety of pricing models on it so oneis like a very popular is a fee basedpricing model the fee based pricingmodel is basically uh it can be donethrough transaction so for every singleAPA call I wanted to charge it dollar sothat is simple transaction and verysuper easy to use on that or the secondone is also calleda tier based pricing the first AP callsis dollar the next 100 APA calls is 50Cents the third 300 API calls 200 to 300APA calls is 25 cents the more they usethe price will change so you definedthat logic in our rate plan managementtool then we take behind the scenes oncewe Define then we know what product isbeing used what trade they've beenpurchased and when they do the meteringwe apply the entire logic and we makesure every transaction has been meteredproperly so like Charlie said anotherpopular use case is revenue share sothere are times where your partner cantake your product to your customersstore their customers and they bring thedirect Revenue to you so Telco is one ofthe popular example on this so wheneverthey really wanted to go back andstarted selling more data to customersso one way they can sell the data theycan can go back and start offeringthrough their stores or Telco websitesbut there are times where customersstarted charging for the data every 10gigs of data is 10 or something then alot of game developer game apps theystarted using Telco apis when they'rereally busy in game when they're runningout of low on the data then they use theTelco apis and they go back and get morethey buy the more data on behalf of theuser game user and then they startedcharging the user so they get therevenue share on that one and the lastone is freemiumwho don't like free stuff right so thesame with Partners too so if you reallywanted to make your API product getsexcitedgive them some free APA calls or let youlet them use your API product for Xnumber of days or make it bothcombination of both like auto warrantyright it's 30 000 miles or five yearswhichever comes first and we do offerthe all three varieties of Premiumcapabilities tooso once you offer this and I really wantto go back and start to talk a littlebit more aboutumhow what type of customers are there sowe identified three different sectionsof customers so RPG offers both prepaidbilling model as well as postpaidbilling model so let me go back a littlebit and see which one is good for whomso first paid a prepaid price Model wealways recommend to long tail developerswhere they don't have enough creditwhere you are really not sure if youreally want to go back and startedengaging its partnership level with eachand every customer so that's where we'rereally encourage prepaid model and prein prepaid model and RPG integrates witha couple of popular API Gateway sorrypayment Gateway platforms such as wallping and if you are a Drupal developerand we do integrate with Drupal Commercemargin so Drupal Commerce module takeshundreds of payment methods and wesupport that one too so the second oneis called a partnership program so whereyou go back and engage the partner andpartner is going to come and startedusing the aps end of the month you willbe sending the invoice to them and theythey will send the bill to you this morekind of like paymentpostgrade model and the third one andit's becoming very popular I stronglyrecommend if you haven't tried and iscalled credit based pricing the creditbase pricing isusuallyusually the sales team and even thefinance team don't want to change theprice of their product very often on itso you don't want to go back and setlike your API product is for everysingle AP call is a dollar and laterthey started changing that one to 50cents or even if you started seeing moredemand you started going up going backand changing that into two dollars onthat instead of that you can always tellthem like okay in order to use this APAcall you need to pay x amount of creditso 10 credits for every single AP callon it but the way how the customeracquires those credits can be vary fromcustomer to customer the private privatepricing is super common in this world soevery single customer they pay differentprice for their service on that so onthe front side every single developersevery single partner will see 10 cents10 credits for every single API call butwhen they give the ten dollars some cashtoo much they get for 10 10 credits forten dollars different customers they get20 credits and third customers they canget 100 credits on that one so you willhave that flexibility on this so this isbecoming really popular and a lot ofcustomers started using itso now let's put all our uh ideas andthoughts into simple example then Ireally wanted to see how it's going towork together on this so let's say wehave a company calledCloud9 and it's in a fictitious imageProcessing Company so that it takesimages or series of images and itidentify the patterns and it will tellyou like okayum if the picture has any kind of likeuh defects that can be there or it canidentify some particular patterns onthat so there are multiple ways you cando that right going back like okay youcan create an app someone is going toupload the app or website someone canupload the website and you offer theservice like every single uh image thatyou upload you can offer that or you canalso take the core functionality andexpose an API then you started sellingthat API so let the customers startedgoing back and started using those apisin their own application so one of theclassical example is checkup Checker isthe API company so who does thebackground check their entire businessmodel is about API only so all they dois just give the API and they starteddoing the background so once youidentify once you identify the corecompetency of like image recognition APIthen you started building the APIproduct around that so once you buildthe API product go back and startedcreating that rate planin this case we will pick like Freewaymodel the first 10AP calls is free then you startedcharging 10 cents for every single APIcall so that's the product then once wecreate the API product and go ahead andstart publishing inpublishing in the developer portal bythe way the way how we publish is seethe developer portal is completelyseamless on it the minute you publishyour Avi product and it will beautomatically shown inuh developer portal the minute youstarted changing your price plan in RPCit will automatically reflected in thedeveloper portal for that so it will beautomatically seamlessly integrated withthat so once the developer started usingyour API product thenum we provide bunch of tools where youcan go back and start it monitoring theAPI performance and you can start itanalyzing the API consumption and alsoyou can go back and start it analyzingthe revenue we provide a lot of toolsfor you to be successful onlineso this is the testimony from one of ourcustomer AccuWeatherthe theme of this testimonies neverunderestimate a small apartment A smalltime developer on that long taildeveloper so if your API is really doinggood that small time developer can turnout with a big Enterprise partner on itso Googlecan you hear meyeah so Google offering multipleincentives for startups and please usethis QR code and if you have anyquestions and go to Startup launch andthey can give you a lot of they can giveyou a lot of details and incentive forstartups at different stages on itand please do provide your feedback andso we'll open a session for question andanswers Charlie and myself we will behere and we'll take a couple ofquestions on itthank you"
