uhfeeling pretty good so I want to welcomeyou all to the Intel session here atGoogle Cloud next and we're gonna have aquick little time to talk through somefun and interesting stuff we're doingwith our great partner Google and withsome of our customers and then we'regoing to try to leave some time at theend for questions so if you have anyquestionsum there's a mic right here and we'll beavailable and hopefully have a chance toget through some of those uh by way ofintroduction uh my name is Lisa Spellmanand I am a corporate vice president andgeneral manager of the Xeon products andsolutions at Intel next Tuesday is my 23years there so I can't even believe itbut I've been at Intel long time done alot of different roles there and spentthe last several working on our Xeonproducts with our wonderful customerslike Google I'm joined by two colleagueshere I have Katie from the Google Cloudteam and I have Sue Chang from Palo Altoworks and I look forward to having thechance to introduce you to them and getyou the opportunity to hear a little bitabout their story so first we're goingto sit here and just talk a little bitabout the history of the partnership soIntel and Google have worked togetherfor ever I mean you know since thebeginning of the company in thebeginning of cloud computing but we'vereally solidified and strengthened ourpartnership since 2016 in building outthe gcp portfolio and product line andjust creating all these you knowWonderful Enterprise Services highperformance Computing Telco Edge AI youknow just the whole gamut of workloadsworking together it's been a greatpartnership that is built on afoundation not only of solving customerneeds and customer requirements but onpushing the Forefront and the edges ofinnovation and we're going to share alittle bit about that today I also wantto take a moment to thank andcongratulate our partners at GoogleCloud for being the very firsthyperscaler to have our fourth gen IntelXeon Processor available for customersthey were early adopters and had justdeep engineering engagement to getprivate preview out ahead of the gameand then they followed that up withGeneral availability of several reallygreat instances that Katie will talk alittle bit more about so it's a greatpartnership and we're very grateful forthe work in the joint engineering wehave the opportunity to do togetherokayso I'm going to talk for a minute aboutthe 4th gen Xeon product so the Xeonproduct is you know the foundation ofessentially all data center you knowCloud to Edge workloads out there thebeauty of it it is the truest form ofgeneral purpose and it can run anyworkload out of the box over the yearswe've continued to invest in addingacceleration for more and differentworkloads to move from Pure generalpurpose into general purpose plus sogeneral purpose with acceleration that'sbuilt in and in this generation wereally increase the levels ofacceleration that we addedum we have just an average across thevariety of workloads on the product wedelivered a 50 little over 50 percentworkload uh performance Improvement andso that's just you know again a singlegeneration and the opportunity toincrease the performance of yourworkloads by 50 in very much the samekind of cost structure so that's justtotal cost of ownership value to thebottom line and delivering what ends upto be a 3X better total cost ofownership output so that TCO is one ofthe most important metrics that we worktogether with our partners and with theindustry on making sure that we'reaccelerating the right workloads andthat we're bringing down the entire costof the solution not just the performancedelivered only through the CPU so we'rereally focused on that you knowefficiency and efficiency of innovationas we all are aware and you're seeingall over the con the conferenceartificial intelligence is uh one of thefastest growing workloads and if youlook at the size of the artificialintelligence workload by compute cyclesthat it consumes you know you sit thereand you have all workloads and thenartificial intelligence and the keggeror the growth of AI is just phenomenalso many opportunities are being openedup new Services being deployed anddeveloped that's why we've invested inactually adding acceleration into theprocessor that is specifically dedicatedto accelerating AI workloads so classicmachine learning deep learning focusedon generative AI so both increasing theprocessing speed as well as the memoryand memory bandwidth speeds andcapabilities so that you can get evenmore out of your infrastructure we'realso focusing on delivering the rightsoftware foundation so we've dedicatedyears of effort to ensuring that themost you know performant and popularFrameworks and AI software algorithmicmodels are running well out of the boxon Xeon and this is an area where we'regoing to continue to invest many AIworkloads are delivered on gpus and theyhave excellent performance but your CPUinfrastructure is often not fullyutilized and with this type of AIacceleration built in you can furtherdrop down the TCO of your AI workloadsbecause you're using under utilizedcapacity and taking advantage of computecycles that you already own and thatyou're already paying for so we thinkit's a really great win-win and a way tokind of complement your infrastructuredeployment decisions so we are spendinga lot of effort in this space we'reinvesting in state-of-the-art generativeAI capabilities to ensure that you knowall of our customers have theopportunity to take advantage of boththe hardware and the softwareacceleration that's built in and it'sjust an area where we see so muchpotential across all Industries likethis is absolutely not specific to OneSingular you know vertical or industrytype we see it really changing the waythat so many services are deliveringokayum I talked a little bit about thepartnership that we have and I I talkedabout some of the history of Intel andGoogle working together this is justsome of the you know examples of whatyou see from Intel and Google where wepartner together and again this isdelivering across you knowinfrastructure modernization and reallytrying to put in place the services andthe capabilities that allow you to takeyour existing infrastructure and againwhether that's a lift and shift or acomplete application modernization andmoving to more of a cloud native type ofoffering we want to offer and supportthat full gamut that full range ofcapabilities Google is you know wellknown in the cloud industry for theirdepth and expertise and the AI andmachine learning space and that'sanother area where you know we continueto invest together to provide that rightlanding and and launch pad for you knowall of Industry these workloads we focustogether on delivering that consistentand balanced performance so that youhave the opportunity to ensure the rightslas and can smooth any of thosetransitions of workloads that maybe havepreviously run in an on-prem environmentand are now moving to a more you knowCloud scale and Cloud structure we alsohave focused on ensuring that we'redelivering across you know all regionsof the world to support the truly Globalnature of so many uh so much of businessthat's done todayour general purpose compute instancesare designed to again deliver thatconsistent performance that can handleyou know every workload and is thebackbone of your infrastructure we alsohave worked together on the higherperformance Computing instances whichKatie will talk about as well as highermemory instances as well that offer thechance to move to your in-memorydatabases in the cloud and again achievethat excellent TCO well you canaccelerate the pace of taking advantageof new generations of technology so it'sbeen you know a great partnership Ithink part of the value that Intel andGoogle bring together is also thepartnership work we do with you knowmajor other players in the industry yousee you know sap Oracle VMware mentionedthere very you know tight relationshipsto ensure that again everything we'redelivering is at that Enterprise classfor youokayumI want to now have a minute and justinvite up Katie so Katie as someone I'veknown in the industry for years andyears he is leading a very importantpart of the Google Cloud portfolio andthe business and he's driving all oftheir compute Services their AI theirmachine learning and he's going to takea minute to talk to you a little bitmore about the specific innovations thatGoogle cloud has brought to Market intheir brand new C3 and H3 instances soKatie why don't you come upthank you thank you LisaIntel and Google have had a long historyof deeply working together and Lisamentioned that in her openingwhen Google Cloud started outwe start with the N1 instanceand we built it on Intel we started withthe first generation Xeon on N1and over the years we've expanded ourportfoliothey've expanded across multiplefamilies of Xeon processorsto where we are todaya full portfoliofinely tunedto workload needs which can be slightlydifferentwhether you're looking for somethingthat's memory intensivemore general purposemore performanta cost efficient part of the portfolioor you may be looking for just theabsolute best inconsistency which iswhat we've done with C3I'll talk a little bit more about C3 andH3 which are the latest members of ourfamilyand uhthe latest to come with Intel's fourthgeneration Xeon and I'll talk a littlebit more about that in a few secondsbut I also want to mention thata lot of the workloads that you all runare VMware workloadsand one of the things that we've donealso is just announced over the last fewdays are ve2uh VMware engine instance to get thoseworkloads onto benefit the benefits ofcloud the elasticity and the Automationin the cloudokayC3C3 is an amazing VMwhy is it an amazing VMwe deeply partnered with Intel on thefourth generation Xeon to bring that toMarket firstbut that was the startwe have 35 Better Price performancewe lit up the AMX instruction set whichis 12 times the performance uh in thatin that realm of AI workloadswe lit up confidential computingwith the TDX so thatfour workloads four users that requirethat level of security you have thatoption nowbut that was the start because workloadsneed computeworkloads need other things they neednetworking they need storage they needother services and so we partnered againwith Intel on the ipu200 gigabits per second three times thepacket processing versus a priorgeneration that's that's the power ofthe network that we're bringing to thismachinewhat our customers are doing with it iseven more they're saying now that you'vegot this offload enginecan I offload my encryption so that Ihave even more consistency and even moreperformance for my workloads that areresiding on the main processorso second pillar on the networking sideagain a joint Innovation with Lisa withher team with Inteluh lighting up the magic within withinC3and finally storagehyperdisc is truly uniqueum we heard about titanium from Thomason day onethe ipu and hyperdesk are part of thattitanium architecture a new way to driveeven more efficiency even more offloadsthrough a scale out architecture whathyperdisc does is it gives youtremendous storage block storageperformance it gives you tremendous iops350 000 iops 10xbetter performance in the productGenerationUmat the end of the day what matters arethe workloads and how it does on them sowe profile this on a number of workloadsand you've seen those on the chart therethis is a fantastic machine forEnterprise grade performance for deepconsistency and something we are trulylike proud ofin working with Intel DepartmentH3 H3 takes everything that C3 got tothe marketso all of that Innovation and computeall of that Innovation and networkingand Storageis herehowever there is a market need withinHPC that is truly uniqueand to address that we said what elsecan we do how much more can we do and wepartnered with Intel on deos and theparallel store file system to give aluster-like file system for those highperformance computing workloads so H3again announced just recently you cansee the numbers on the on the uhdifferent workloads and Frameworks outthere it's truly a new member of ourfamily built on the Innovation we'vedriven together uh with Intel and takingthat Innovation to new areas uh into thesoftware Ram into the file system realmto bring that whole package for theworkloadsat the end of the dayit's a deep partnership based ontechnology between two Innovativecompanies but the key goal is to lightup that magic and bring that Innovationfor you all so I'm super happy aboutthis and that I'll get Lisa back onstageall right thank youum so I I'd be remiss too if I I didn'tmentionum just the incredible work that hasbeen done to continuously improve thesustainability of these offerings too weare so well aware of how important thathas become in the decisions of whatinfrastructure you're going to supportwhat you're going to use and land andit's it's a really strong partnershipthereum the Intel Xeon Processor ismanufactured almost completely onrenewable energy so 90 to 95 so it's themost sustainably manufactured processoron the planet and then you pair it withthe you know infrastructure leadershipthat the Google engineering teamdelivers and you you really do getstrong improvements every generation inthat performance and performance perwatt so you have the opportunity to notonly you know capture some of that valueyou heard Katie talk about some of thatbut you also can utilize that to meetyour ESG goals and continue to advanceyour company's sustainability uhprogress and goals so Katie was kindenough to let me show this next slidewhich has a bunch of the performancethat is delivered through the instancesthat his team has created and built forthe market so these are real generationover generation you know from the end toto the C3 Real Results tested built andshown and because of that early privatepreview work you saw a couple of thequotes but what we have is we have youknow real customers that are alreadyexperiencing these benefits and so if Icould encourage you to do any anythingout of this it would be really to gotake some time and start playing aroundwith this and and really kind of seewhat C3 and H3 can do how you can startto advance your confidential Computingfor you know your workloads and yourdata that it demands it because there'sa lot of really good value there thatshould be enough to help you know Propelyou forward so we're really excitedabout delivering this type ofperformance on workloads we've talkedabout you know integrated acceleratorsfor AI you can see that show up in thenumbers but you also see that show up inother areas as well where thatperformance Jennifer den and that valuejust continues to go upum also if there's a workload that youcan't find in any of our collateral andmessaging we've tested a lot of them butwe're always happy to help and help youyou know make that value proposition uhpitch and make it really work for you sowe're proud of all of that work okay sothe um next uh portion here is actuallyone of our shared customers so bothIntel and Google have a multi-yearrelationship with Palo Alto networks aindustry leader and they've been doingsome very Innovative work in the spaceof network threat detection and theywere one of our earliest users of the C3instances and I'd like to invite up tothe stage Su Chang who's a seniordistinguished engineer at Palo Altonetworks and has played just aninstrumental role in delivering the PaloAlto Network Services out to theircustomers and maybe many of you areactually Palo Alto networks customers sohe's going to come up here and just talka little bit about the journey todeliver you know AI based Network threatdetection services and how that's beengoing for them so why don't you come onup on stageokay all right thank you okay thank youthank you Rita for inviting me to thetalkI'm happy to share what we are doing inpart of the networks and uh how Googleand Intel is helping us to do thisum in part of the networks we detect uhNetwork a Detachment work that was thatthe network threats can come from theinside from a compromise user talk tothe command control in the internet orit can be a Outsider attacker to injectcommand injection into your network soin part of the levels we uh we have thisinvolvement of threat detectionmechanisms at the beginning we collectthe virus samples from the wild and weanalyze it wewrite up signatures to match it and uhand we deploy these signatures in allthe firewalls and when the virus comealong in the network we method we blockit so that's what's great but as covetvirus is a network virus evolves toothey mutate they have variants and it'sjust that they do a whole lot faster sothe humanly involved signaturedevelopment is not enough so that'swhere Network machine learning comesalong machine learning can detectunknown never seen before stress morecapability and then over the years thethreats keep evolving and we keepevolving thewe who employ more sophisticatedMachinery like deep learning with neuralnetworkum your network as you know is a veryexpensive business it's uh millions ofways and then they have to take a lot ofCPU and memory to deploy it so it's hardto deploy it in the firewall as acost-effective way so in part of thenetworks we developed a architecture topick some suspicious traffic sent to thecloud and we use the cloud service tohelp the firewall to detect threat usesso we deployed our model in the cloudand then nowwith Intel and Google's help we candeploy it in a efficient way because weneed to do this in a super fast tobecause of the nature of the inlinetraffic we cannot take too long so it'sa in-line traffic we need a humanlatency a super fast latency uh maybethe next slide pleaseokay so in this journey we we take ahelp from Intel and Google so from Intelwith the latest generation of Dionprocessor there are capabilitiesspecifically designed for machinelearning and deep learning so we getthis help from Intel to look at theirtechnology in theI I said two years ago when we developedthis new service uh Intel already haveis a second generation and thirdgeneration VR in the cloud and nowit also have thelibraries and tools to help us tooptimize the models from s floatingpoints 32-bit to into eight to quantizethe model and uh with that also the VMprocessor has a vni in such a setspecific build for machine learningworkload so with this combined we wereable to achieve 6X performance scalingwhere we delivered the service to thecloud and then later this year Intelcome up with the new processor sephorRapids and with the new instruction setAMX and we realized that oh that doublesare performing performance again so alltogether it's a 12x faster comparing tothe previousearlier implementation and with Google'shelp these Technologies are deployed inthe gcp pretty fast and we were able tomigrate our service to its uh relativelyeasy uh no Cool Change needed um enterthe library or the building in themachine learning framework in tensorflowso we pick it up very easily and as amatter of fact we actually migrate thethe migrated new workload is turned onlive on Monday two days ago so uh greatwork uh yeah that's what I want to sharethank you[Applause]okay so some of you might not know butthe engineers first presentation infront of you know big audience like thisand so a special Round of Applause fornailing itand also I just want to share we weretalking this morning and and you knowthe graph shows that performanceImprovement but it is feedback from ourcustomers that motivates us and drivesour changes in Behavior soum when we first offered uh out startedputting acceleration for AI into ourprocessors we had some of our ownum versions of Frameworks and we got thestrong feedback from customers like PaloAlto Network said hey you really got toget upstreamed you got to get intotensorflow and that's how we're going tomake these Services actually you know goto market and be usable and we take thatfeedback very seriously and have spentyou know the time and put in thesoftware engineering work to ensure thatwe are Upstream so that it's not hard touse these capabilities that you you knowyou get your instance you log in you useyou know standard versions of theFrameworks you know the main branch andthen you're getting all of that benefitand value so we really do appreciate andvalue feedback like that to make all ofour technology easy year to adopt anduse and get benefits fromwhich gears a little bit to talk aboutum a software a SAS company that Intelactually acquired called granulate and Iwant to introduce you to them in caseyou haven't had a chance to meet them sogranulite's a very cool technology thatis built just to make you guys look goodthat's it so what it does is the teamyou know lands an agent onto your uhinto your infrastructure it has no codechanges it's not touching your data ithas no access to that but it is watchingfor traffic patterns and looking at theway that you are utilizing yourinstances utilizing your VMS where yourpressure points are where yourbottlenecking where your CPUs aregetting bottled after the IP or otherparts of the network storage whatever itis then after it has some time analyzingit starts to make recommendations andputs a performance agent that's therethat helps reroute traffic and throughthat delivers to you cost savings aswell as performance increases and one ofthe cool things about their model isthat you're not paying for any of thatuntil they have proven to you that yourcosts are coming down so we recently hadthe opportunity to you know go throughthe Google process and get this put onthe Google marketplace so it's nowavailable for everyone to use uh hasthat opportunity and I just I thinkSolutions like that that are you knowRoi guaranteedum are are so great I was actuallychatting with the granulate team and Isaid well does anybody ever turn it offand they said well we haven't had anycustomers yet that said you know whatI'd like to stop saving money so I Iguess once you're once you're in you'reyou're pretty in if any of you have anyquestions afterwards we do have a boothin our demo and then my friend here inthe bright orange he addressed so thatyou could find him is our residentgranulate expert and would be happy toyou know take questions and and askabout that but we're seeing like reallystrong benefits and this ability tocontinue to optimize even within like avery well optimized infrastructure andoptimize workloads there is always roomto be more efficient and this is a waythat you know you can help demonstratehow you're bringing costs of yourservice down as well so I have anexample here that I'll show this is oneof the granulate's customers hereum you know running in Cloudinfrastructure and nilas has 50 000developers in their environment that areusing so you know it's got some highintensity to it it has lots of you knowbusy traffic times and and can have alot of you know congestion but asthey've been delivering support fortheir 50 000 developers worldwidethey've simultaneously been able toachieve these uh results so 58 reductionin response time that's huge to yourdeveloper Community nobody wants theirdevelopers waiting and developers havesuch a low tolerance for waiting anywaysso it's really you know a win-win butthey're also bringing down the cost oftheir services and you might think whywould Intel and Google Cloud want tobring down the cost like that's theirrevenue but the reality is that we knowover years the more efficient and betterperforming your infrastructure is themore new services and new capabilitiesthat your business can afford to launchand deliver Revenue yourselves so we seethis you know self-fulfilling flywheelof the greater the efficiency thegreater the performance the greater theopportunities are that open up soanyways I encourage you to take a lookin the marketplace see if granulatemight be a good offering for you andsomething to explore we're prettyexcited about the potential that it hasto offer okay so we're just about to thetime for some q aum I uh I think I my uh I need can youclick to the next slide for some reasonthis guy stopped clickingumI just wanted to you know close out herewith a couple of action itemsumcan you guys click to the next slide andstop tothere we go okay so the action items Ialready talked about one of them pleasego out play around a little bit test outC3 test out H3 look at TDX like start tothink about your confidential Computingenvironment and and what you need thereum our fourth gen uh fourth gen powergcp instances oh it's okay I'm on mylast one this is it okay uh poweredinstances are available today soum take a opportunity to look into themtest your workloads and then the lastone is you know swing by the booth so wehaveum we have generative AI demos up andrunning on C3 we have a really cool highperformance Computing uh on H3 we've gota granulate demo to show you exactlywhat I talked about happening and andthe opportunity to see how the agentworks and answer any of the questionsyou might have around you know like thesecurity of it orum you know just how does it interactwithin my system and my application so Iencourage you to you know take all ofthose steps in your busy rest of yourday and afternoonforeign"
