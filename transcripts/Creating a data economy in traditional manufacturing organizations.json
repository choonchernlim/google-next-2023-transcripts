    "transcript": "foreign[Music]folksgood afternoon this is uh creating adata economy and traditionalmanufacturing organizations if that'snot your final destination you'reprobably in the wrong room but that'swhere we're goingsoI'll introduce myself and then we'll getinto introducing Our Guest here fromCaterpillar but Luis Solano I'm anindustry development manager formanufacturing at Google and what thatmeans is I'm a sales overlay positionand we have the privilege of talking tosomeone from one of the most iconicbrands in the world caterpillar they'rebrand synonymous with construction andthe economyand really this project that Melissa andteam led is about one of the mostdaunting tasks an Enterprise can go atgo after right it's so daunting mostpeople don't even start think about 100year old company with multiple sourcesof customer data how do you get thatdata in the right place so it's usableall the challenges related to not onlytechnology but the change managementpart so with that I'll let Melissaintroduce herself and and caterpillarso Melissa's fallenberger I run theGoogle marketing platform and GoogleCloud platform portion of marketingum for caterpillar have been withcaterpillar in almost nine years and ourteam is a small team so I work on theproduct management side of the house wehave our engineering side of the house awhile along along with our solutionarchitecture side of the house and ourGIS side of the house so and we have afew of everybody in the audience todaytoo as well so if you have questions onanything we're going to be good to goand then I'll talk to you a little bitabout caterpillar as wellso we are always you know as working atsustainable making the world better witha sustainable world and so that can beinclude you know powering donationsinspiring Innovation restoring thingsafter natural disasters and of courseimproving if you've driven on a roadthere's a good chance it was built withsome Caterpillar machineryif we go to the next weather so we havefour million products active around theworld right now and 1.4 million of thoseare sending data back to Caterpillar uhyou know in real time in a lot of casesso with that we have 17 different brandsso everything from as you can see in ourproduct lines the diesel electric floatyou know locomotives with Progress Railour industrial turbines with solarturbines out in San Diego here miningequipment construction equipment and ofcourse our off Highway Diesel andnatural gas engines as well as powergeneration for a lot of the data centersin the worldwe have you know we're in 150 primarylocations across 25 countries and wehave about 110 000 employees and we havea dealer Network so one of ourchallenges is always how we sell to thedealer but our dealers sell to ourcustomers and so getting that customerdata is always one of those things thatwe'll talk about during the presentationhereawesomeall right so we're going to have aquestion and answer here at the end soif you have questions please hold offuntil the end just come to the mic inthe last 10 or 15 minutes well let'stalk let's start by talking about thethe overall scope and objective so maybetalk to us about why did you have to dothis project or some of the objectivesmaybe top three objectives and alsoreally the scope of the old programsure so one of the reasons we had to dothis project we have a we had somedifferent about actually six differentareas of challenges or things that wereconsidered our birding platform one ofthem was that a lot of our marketingdata sat with our vendors and suppliersand so with that we wanted to bring thatdata in-house as well as to make surecaterpillar owned that data so you knowthat can be in our marketing area we'refocused on our marketing data at thispoint and that's includes some of ourcustomer behavioral data from ourmarketing and so really there was it satwith a lot of our ad agencies and so oneof it was really to be able to do theanalytics and insights that we wanted todo across our Enterprise it was reallywe needed to have that in a centralizedlocation so we could make that some ofthe things that we're enabling with thisis to make that self-serve for ourcustomer our business unit partners andcustomers internal to Caterpillar wealso had the you know the constantchange in marketing with privacy andconsent demands whether it's gdpr CCPAwe've got all all the acronyms ofalphabet soup out there as we call itand so there was a lot of regulatorychanges of how that data was managed howit could be you know the consent tocollect it and so there were things likethat that we needed to do to make surethat we were handling that the way ourcustomers and our and our customers andthe companies of those customersexpected it to be handledof course there's also the legal andretention so caterpillar of course beingan almost 100 year old company has a lotof different policies and internalsecurity that we need to follow part ofthat was Data retention as you know alot of the marketing platforms out theredon't hold the data for a real long timeyou need to get it out of the theactivation platforms and into a datawarehouse or a data lake so a lot of thethat also drove where we were going forwith data retention there was also anEnterprise marketing need everybodywants you know marketing return oninvestment so we needed to be able tohave this data together to be able to dothose types of analysis and insights ofcourse that we also had I.T requirementsand policies that we needed to meet aswell and that's where we partnered upwith our our GIS team and our vendormanagement team to get our MasterServices Cloud agreement in place andwhat we could and couldn't do with thatdata and with the way it was set up andthen of course we all know about Googleanalytics four so caterpillar has over570 websites that we track with Googleanalytics and so we you know with Googleanalytics 4 you need to be able to getthat into bigquery and so that was oneof the other things that drove that withthe migration to ga4 we needed that thatbigquery data set to be able to do thatanalysis we were able to do beforethe other part of this is really wherethe customer came in and so really thethe business case for this so that waskind of the the you know the burningplatform but really the business casefor this came into where we wanted to beable to serve our customers better weneeded wanted to have relevantengagements with them not that peanutbutter and jelly spread of you knoweverybody gets the same ad we wanted tobe able to give them personalizedexperiences based on their behaviorbased on what we could do about them asa customer what we knew about theircompany with the industries they workedin and so it was really be able to havethose conversations based on what weknew based on those prospects andcustomers so not just the knowncustomers but also what you know ourvisitors were doing on some of our moremarketing uh interacted websitesthe other part of that is to be able toproperly ingest that and store it tocustomers expectations so we wanted tomake sure we were protecting that datalike we said in our privacy policies andwhat we were doing with that and thenthe ability to connect all of this toall of the other data sets caterpillarhas across the Enterprise so customerdata telematics dataum sales data product data so the theability to be able to tie all of thistogether was one of the key pieces thatwe needed to do as a business case to beable to offer those personalizedexperiences on the website as well asreach those Target audiences with ourmarketingyeah one comment here on thepersonalized experience it's aninteresting um area because if you talkto anyone out there on the show and talkabout any industry it's always thereright whether you're talking tohealthcare where you're talking tobanking where you're talking tomanufacturing people expect a certainlevel of personalized experience at thevery least they want to be able to havea conversation with multiple people andnot have to explain to the next personwhat the previous conversation was aboutright and that's just driven by theconsumeration summarization of theexperience into the worldum what about scope Melissa so yeahyeah this project was really you know wewe had a Google Cloud piece of it thatwe'll talk about but we also had thescope of the data we were looking forand our personal project on my team isreally our digital intelligenceWarehouse you'll hear me reference thatis diw and this is really where we'reholding all of our app and web analyticsdata so those those 570 Google analyticsproperties all of our digital ads andads account data all of our social mediadata all of our Play store apps data ourGoogle search Council data theSalesforce marketing cloud data and thenover all of all of those generate ourbusiness unit projects and so though theprojects that for the business units arewhere they're using that data with othercaterpillar data to do those analysisinsights dashboards reporting and thosepersonalizations and marketing marketingAnalyticsawesomeum so let's talk aboutum what kind of challenges do you expectand encounter and and reallyum how did you solve them on the journeyand also talk a little bit aboutthe onboarding existing Google Cloudprojects to the platformsureum so really to get started this was aproject we knew we needed to do and sowith that it was really there was a lotof four really big areas with that soone of it is we knew we needed to getexecutive support we had the operationalteam asked so the marketing team'sasking the sales teams asking thewebsites and app teams asking but weneeded that executive support level toget the buy-in and understand you knowwhat we could offer to our customers ina better way so there was also a fundingask with that which is really wherewhere we're currently going through ane-commerce acceleration some of you maybe involved in that in some of the thePartnerships that we have and with thatthere was that we've we've been we'reable to tie in all of the needs that wehad with that e-commerce accelerationproject we also had the Enterprise datastrategy so this is one where we we area multi-cloud company and so theEnterprise data strategy was the theneed to Not Duplicate data but also makeit in a cost effective and simple to useand self-serve way in the end for ourbusiness partners so taking thosetechnical needs along with the businessneeds to really go where we needed to goand then we had a lot of LegacyEnterprise projects that we already hadin Google Cloud that we really needed tobe able to take it to the new standardswe were studying the New Foundation wewere putting in place and really that'swhere that Foundation stand up came infirst so that's where we first partneredand that's where we partnered with ourGIS team and as our Global InformationServices team and with our our vendormanagement team to get a master ServicesCloud agreement in place which gets allthat language that you need in there wealso were able to partner with GoogleCloud experts and resources both fromGoogle and some from some Partners tohelp us set up that Foundation the waywe knew we knew we needed to whetherthat was the account hierarchy the cloudhierarchy the different business unitprojects and all those we'll talk aboutthose a little bit later as well we hada Professional Services partner that wewas was you know we worked with Googleto find the right fit for Caterpillarand then we also had the Danishownership and roles and responsibilitiesso with four teams involved in a companythat's highly Matrix this is a was oneof the challenges we knew we were goingto have but it also worked out reallywell because we were able to set thefoundation from the beginning to reallydo what we needed to do and then ofcourse we had the business partner needsduring the build so some of theseprojects already existed and with thosebusiness partners they needed to keeptheir dashboards running they needed tokeep their anal you know analysisrunning they needed to keep their theirmarketing projects running and sosetting up a whole new Foundation whilethey were using data that had beenpartially set up before was one of thosechallenges we knew we were coming to butwe also had great Partnerships acrossour four teams to be able to actuallyhandle that and and keep everythingrunning while it was going onyeah just a couple of comments hereabout executive support because wementioned how these projects are donethey've most people don't even start andone of the reasons why they're dauntingis that everyone believes that they havean optimized system for their needsright you have multiple owners everyonefeels they're optimized for themselvesbut you're asking someone to globalglobal optimization right to basicallythink about the process and ultimatelythe executive supports not only aboutpaying the bills and supporting theproject but also help people understandthe value and drive the behavior changeis necessary to really drive the projectforwardlet's talk about this little designMelissa can you talk about the solutiondesign and the effort that you did thereyeah so the solution design in this camefrom a lot of parts we had our solutionarchitecture team involved we had ourGIS team involved we had our marketingteams involved we did voice the voice ofbusiness and really it came down to acouple of things in how we designed thesolution part of it was what could we dowith the teams and and products that wealready had and then of course themarketing needs that we were trying tohandle is really looking at where werethere out of the box Integrations sowith that Google marketing platformintegration with Google Cloud productsand that you know like I said the Googleanalytics was a big leader in this andthe automatic part of how that data goesinto bigquery to be used and analyzedwas a huge a huge decision factor inthat so those out of the boxIntegrations the apis the the ease ofuse on those the amount of support outthere for them was part of that thatproduct selection along with thepipeline tools and API yeah I understandagain this is all for our diw projectspecifically of what how we were tryingto get all that marketing datacentralized and so really it was thatwas part of it but then there was alsothe cost benefit to the the marketers sowe evaluated things like if we custombuilt an API to pull from one of ourmarketing platforms versus used a apartner a partner API it was really tosee you know which one was that wellcertain certain of those marketingTechnologies out there do 12 to 15 APIupdates a year and so when you've got alarge company and a lot of teams you'reworking with it made sense to go withPartnerships that would allow us to pullthat data in as well as be able toreally maintain it and put our put ourresources where we need to to get thebusiness value out of it versus havingto create Tech and Tech debt in that inthat area so part of it was that productselection based on those things and thenof course the cloud structure so we alot of the design is we have about650 projects in there each of those hastheir own data owner within caterpillarso we needed a with that Matrix org andthe amount of business units anddivisions and product groups that wehave we really needed to be able toaccount for that Matrix org both in thebuilding that we'll talk about in asecond but also in our account structureso that we could have the data ownersgive the right permissions to the rightpeople to access and use that data so wedid something with views in the businessunit project so instead of giving accessto that raw data right now we do we doviews and so that was part of the designwith our solution architecture team andwith the partnership with Google andwith our GIS team on the security sideof that was how could we give thataccess and look through that to be ableto really solve those problems that weit wasn't really a problem but it wasone of those things that we needed toget ahead of and then we also have Devand product environment so we needed tobe able to do in certain cases like someof the personalization features we needto be able to test things out in lowerenvironments before so we've now got aDev area and a prod area in certainbusiness unit projects and then itreally came down to those billing needslike I said with the internal recoveryand it wasn't so much the the externaldollars but those internal how howwithin caterpillar the structure ofbusiness works and so really the billingsetup was a was a key feature here so wewent with a folder in Project level andthen each of those projects are owned bythat data owner so we were able to setup billing through with uh out of thebox and Integrations with our internalbilling systems that were already inplace for some of our other Cloudproducts be able to use that same systemand you know make that a lot easier todo than we than we had we thought it wasgoing to be we also were able to Defineownership so a lot of times our our siteowners or our data owners didn't realizewhat they meant as a data ownerum and so defining those roles andresponsibilities is part of the ofreally the solution design in this wasreally you know letting them know whattheir responsibilities were as well ashelping them understand what their rolein the in the whole project was overallyeah a couple I mean even though this isa burning platform this still was acause benefit uh effort done tounderstand how to select the productright correct yeah a lot of this camedown to a lot of analysis with oursolution architecture team to make surewe were we if we didn't have a productalready what fit what should be done inGoogle Cloud versus somewhere else a lotof that and that's an ongoing processlike I said we're still at thatfoundational level of getting a lot ofthis the rotate in so as you saw in ourin our scoped area it was really we'regetting that that raw data in we're onto building those consumer tables nextand then you know enabling a lot of thethe marketing projects out thereawesomeum so let's talk about you know likelike many customers you're in amulti-cloud environment right you haveuh no obviously Google Cloud but alsodata in our competitors Cloud so how doyou basically do you deal any challengesin that area and how do you encounterthem yes so with with our multi-cloudenvironment there's you know some of ourdata sits in in other clouds some of ourcustomer data some of the data we needfor marketing and really this is whereour solution architecture team comes inand soum we'll have we have we have Zach andAshish and the audience here and they'vethey've been instrumental in determiningwhen we need to do something in GoogleCloud versus when we've got somethingthat maybe a different way to do it andthen also how those go together but yeahwe have data sitting in multi-cloudslike many Enterprises and it's it's beenyou know very interesting today in thepresentations that I've sat through youknow how much is is multi-cloudenvironments and so that's beenrefreshing but also at the same timeit's it is one of those challenges andbeing able to connect that data is thefirst thing that having the rightpipelines and right Integrations to doit is is really that next levelyeah thank you so one of the thingsthat's was challenging for your projectis you didn't have a lot of Google Cloudtrain resources so talk to me about thatjourney and where you're at in that thattransition yeah so we we had a it wasGoogle how it was being used um sparselyacross the Enterprise and so as wedecided to take on this project and wewent through that we had solutionarchitecture teams we're learning thethe Google cloud system our GIS team wasstanding up do a new team to supportthis in the Cloud area of GIS we had ourown team was adding in Engineers to dothat and so one of the things that we wefound interesting in this is really thata lot of the resources that applied forsome of these roles that we were openingup were not necessarily Google Cloud butthey had a cloud experience overall andso with that the the ability for Googleto come in and help with trainingsessions and just the amount ofeducation and support that's out fromGoogle already really helped bring speeda lot of that up plus as we're buildingthis we're we're you know all learningtogether so part of that is good in thelearning together is also making us muchmore Innovative in some of these thingsas we're trying to find out what's thebest solution so you know as a productis it way a b or c and so we have a lotof different points of view fromprevious experience with the resourceswe have to say you know we did this overhere but we did this over here and sowe've been it's been a challenge butalso refreshing because it's kind ofbeen an innovation at the same time yeahit's a great point because I mean werecognize that trying to find findingGoogle Cloud brain resources is not easyand so the point is let's get people whojust know cloud in general we have thesystems and the programs to train themeffectively and really don't let that bea detriment to starting your projectoverallum what about scaling if you talk to thepeople out in this room that word comesup all the time right a lot of Pilotsbeing done out there and very few peopleare scaling out behind that rightespecially in my area intelligentmanufacturing but take your pick solet's talk about your scale challengesyeah yeah so scaling was one of thethings we have again you know just likewe had to scale Google analytics acrossall of our our websites we started withit on two we started on it with two withthe free version and and have scaled toall those websites we needed again toscale that data in the Cloud area tooand so you know we had from onboardingso whether that was our our new teams wewere standing up that's teamspecifically for our diw project we dideducation sessions with Google so everyother week we had a training sessionthat might be on a certain product inone case it might be on a certainservice it might be on security butthose we did those for for almost a yearoverall and every two weeks we'd haveyou know a one to two hour session ofjust getting people familiar and so asthe teams grew they learned about theproducts but also how they applied towhat we were doing we also built a newGIS Cloud team so again that that cloudteam is being stood up and so that was ascaling thing because just just likeeverything else at caterpillar we needto be able to scale it across all ourIndustries all our business units andall our our companies too so it's notjust CAD it's it's our 17 other brandsas welland how do we separate that data to makeit you know align with what we need todo so there's a lot of considerationsthere and then we had great vendormanagement support so being able to wewe were the the estimate we wereoriginally told for getting our ourMaster Cloud agreement through well I'mjust going to say we we cut that time byabout 60 65 percent so that was a a newrecord for Caterpillar and I can I givecredit to our vendor Management Area ourGIS area all working together to makesure all of those terms and agreementswere in place to be able to do that andwith the help from from Google to beable to be a great partner to work withon thatwe also had pipelines so again we'vethose those 570 websites we have a lotof suppliers and vendors and and AD Techthat we do and so we did we did workwith a third-party Pro Services partneron some of that pipeline work along withour engineering team we did do terraformautomation which is making a hugedifference in being able to speed theadoption of our business unit projectsand be able to set up projects andfolders in a much more automatedeverything's the same type of way andreally be able to do that and then ourpipeline tools again we had we wereusing some of the out-of-the-boxIntegrations between the Google productswe had the apis with a lot of things andthen we had five Tran was one of our ourpartners to be able to bring in a lot ofthat martech datavalidation was was another scaling thingso when you have 500 and you know over500 data owners you also need to be ableto validate that data you're pulling inbecause while we're in charge of pullingin we're kind of the data Steward on itso we needed validation to be done tomake sure what was coming in wasactually right and so that's one of theprocesses we're going through right nowis really the data owner involvement andso the our our ad platform owners oursocial platform owners are validatingthat all of those tables and all of thatdata that's coming in is correct is inthe right format matches what they werepulling out of the platform itself andso that's been one of the scale thingsthat has been kind of an unexpectedChallenge and but it was also into thatthat scaling that we needed to do and beable to really you know there's not oneor two owners here where we're talkingprobably close to 600 different dataowners and then we needed to be able tohave the analytics and marketing teamsthat were already using this datadirectly from the platform terms dovalidations as well so across ourdifferent business units and all oftheir marketing teams and then acrossthe globe regional marketing teams wereally needed to be able to have thosevalidations done as well so there was alot of validation that's going on andthen our access and project setup so webuilt a lot of business processes as wewere we were building out the foundationand we had dedicated resources for thatwhich was key but there's that was acouple of the things that we're you knowwe'll talk about here in a second withLessons Learnedyeah so I think one of the things topoint out is as you heard Melissa speakabout the program to this pointthere was a lot of non-technology thingsthat you had to deal with right becausethe other day that's the technology isimportant obviously we're Google Cloudbut you also have to deal with thechallenges associated with the with theorganization this is almost 100 year oldcompany uh 600 owners think about thatso it's a lot of people to navigateright so that's one of the key thingsthat we want to talk about so what aboutother Lessons Learned Melissa yeah soLessons Learned was it was a a big areaI mean we had aJew and then of course things that thatwe expected and we really learned alongthe way so I'll have you go to the youknow one of the biggest things that wefound was defining those roles andresponsibilities that has been keybetween all the different teams involvedbut also even with those data ownerswhat are they responsible for what arewe responsible for what are you know arethe different groups responsible for andreally that has been because we'vedefined those early during thefoundation this has really been an areawhereit's been a game changer as we've stoodthis up and being able to roll this outthe Enterprise education that we talkedabout earlier we're doing datadictionaries I know some of this soundsmaybe more basic than we're at but likeI said we're at the foundation right nowum we're doing a welcome playbook forbusiness units as there as they'rebuilding their Googleum analytics knowledge and their GoogleCloud knowledge their Google marketingknowledge and and all of this this issome of the some of the state it's thefirst time our marketing partners andour marketing business units partnersare have ever seen this data so they'veused you know exports before and nowwe're this is the first time they'regetting to see this data so we'rehelping them along and part of ourproduct management area is really doingthat Education and Training to get thatadoption we need so one pagers and queryhelpers and you know some of the thingsannounced here today are we're lookingforward to thoseum and then governance you know who cansee the data do we do when do weduplicate it versus when do we justcreate a view into it the types of datathat is allowed into our in our diwproject versus where you know apply in adifferent one of our systems that wehave and then the access controls withthat again that goes back to those dataowners and who who can do what with thatdataum with our what the customers expect aswellso I say build it and they will come andI know that's kind of a baseballreference here but we by the end of thisyear we expected to have three businessunits using this data in a project forwe're actually this says 28 but we'reactually at 34 as of yesterday so it hasgrownum absolutely crazy and we know it couldbe more like every week still on my teamyeah we'll we'll get a new request forwe need to be able to do this and weneed a business unit project to standthat up to be able to access that dataand join it so we have a lot of projectsand going and it's growing fast and thenreally the other lesson learned we hadis node attack know what's available inyou know the cloud that we're using andthe other clouds where what fits bestwhere what are the best practices froman industry standpoint in you know someof the marketing projects versusstanding up the foundational area onthis what are the out of the boxcapabilities versus what do you have tocustomize and then those skill sets wetalked about the resources and gettingthe right people in the right jobs andthen of course that billingconfiguration so there was really a lotof different things working in withsystems that have been withincaterpillar for a long time versus newones we were standing up all togetheryeah I love the three versus 34 exampleright and I think the lesson there forme is that look there's no killer usecase here right there isn't any use caseit's going to get 50 different groupssay I'm in start with anything small getvalue do another one all of a suddenpeople say wow these guys are gettingbenefits from this here's anotheropportunity right people spend so muchtime trying to figure out the road mapto the exact level of detail start smallstart with anything get wins people loveto be engaged with projects that drivevalue overall yeahum so let's talk about this digitalintelligence warehouse diw and what areyou enabling with it yeah so diw reallyis enabling our Enterprisepersonalization like I said this all alleverything we're doing comes back to howwe can better serve our customers andgive them the experiences that they'reexpecting so really it's about not onlyjust centralizing that data so where itmakes it like our marketers lives easierbut it also is providing us the abilityto own that data and manage that data aswell as reach audiences that we haven'treached before because now we're able toconnect that data with other data withincaterpillar to be able to do thatreporting the analytics and thoseinsights that then make our marketingsmarter too and so what that all comesdown to is be with smarter marketing wecan have those better experiences withour customers and meet their needs bothfrom the Privacy side of the house butalso with those expectations you know alot of people are going to shop and whenyou abandon your cart you kind of expectto need email or an offer or an ad toshow up so it's been able to enablethose types of things that we are ableto now do because of this data and thethe fact that it's now centralized beable to or have our marketers use it andthen really be able to to drive thosecustomer expectations and and meet themawesomeum just to wrap things up first of allthank you Melissa for the insights andthe time we appreciate itum one of the reasons why we chose uhMelissa and she basically volunteered todo this is that we felt it was a goodexample of uh don't get overwhelmed byThe Challenge right it's easy to sayI've got to get 600 people aligned onwhat we want to do here uh you you don'teven know where to start right so herteam did it she's obviously started onthis journey she's by no means finishbut she has a path forward and the wholewhole thing is that it's not just abouttechnology there are basically businessprocess changes adoption changes changemanagement efforts so she tookconsideration all those things to getthis project up and running and lookforward to hearing about her use of thatdata I'm excited about the use of gen Aiand this data now that they have thatdata in one place you're enabling deadAI opportunities that you weren't ableto do before listen if you're interestedin anything we just talked about pleasereach out to Google rep I'm happy tojoin uh host a joint executive briefingsession working on trials hiscapabilities uh and with that appreciateyour time and have a great show it's dayone day two and day three awaits thankyouforeign"
