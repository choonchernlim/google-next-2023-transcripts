well asworking with the change management sideof things as well making sure we arerolling out this tool effectivelyI have I have colleague Krishna herewith meumhow are you guys doing todayum my name is can you hear meyou betternosure I just yeah I'll take it yeah thereyou gomy name is Krishna malengi I'm thedirector of architecture at CMEum heavily involved with collaborationtools at CME Group Google workspace isone of those items right you know it's ahighly collaborative application that weneed to work with all of our employeesconsultant you know businesses customersprospects Etc like that very excited tojust kind of talk to you guys about ourjourney and uh kind of like answer anyquestions that you guys might have intowards our journey and then help youguys out anywhere possible uh I'll havedirect kind of go hello everyone my nameis Jared nadanga I am the global head ofsolutions engineering for Googleworkspace at evident uh my role in theirJourney was essentially pre-sales andpost sales guidance so uh evidence isinvolved from the requirements Gatheringstage to the implementation phase aswell as after the fact so helpingcustomers adopt the product making surethat they are following along with bestpractices as they go through theirjourney and giving them bits and piecesof what to do next uh we can go aheadherethank youokay so for today uh we are trying tocover offum simi's own journey to Googleworkspace why they actually did it whatwas the project Vision why why did itwhat was the compelling event that madethem choose to go Google workspace weare also trying to cover what were themain core tenets of the project itselfor the the main success criteria thatthey had as they moved over to Googleworkspace and how they actually gotthere uh Ashley had mentioned changemanagement that's obviously a very bigpart I think Google works basedimplementation and we want to walkthrough you guys a little bit throughthat uh today so who is evident thetagline that we've been using lately isthat we are a 55 000 person five billiondollar startup uh we are the result of adivesting company Otto so atos is aglobal GSI that is really heavy uh theyhave a heavy presence in emea as well asAPAC and latam not so much in NorthAmerica and evident is looking to uhchange that so uh evidence itself ismade up of a bunch of different Legacycompanies I came from a company calledmavenwave which has over a dozen yearsin the Google Cloud ecosystem veryhighly specialized partner we were abouta thousand ish people before we gotacquired now we are part of a largergroup fully focused on digitaltransformation my part of business isdigital transformation we also do lotsof big data data security moving peopleto the cloud so on and so forthso we were just talking about CME likeyou know who are we like what does CMEdoes I'm not sure like if everyone knowsexactly what it is uh we are like aleading uh derivative um Marketplaceum we enable clients to trade FuturescashOTC products and um this kind of likeempowers them to kind of like managetheir own risk and also capturecapabilities are out there opportunitiesand stuff like thatum so we also uh uh pretty like widerange of global market products also aswell for the trading doesn't a highlevel on what we do for Google uh forCMA groupum here's a little bit of Historyum so we've uh we started back at 1848and there are so many differentMilestones that we have reached inbetween one of the key thing for thispresentation I would like to highlightis 2021 we signed a 10-year partnershipwith Google Cloud productsum so that's all we are going to talkabout here like how we kind of likestarted using Google Cloud products andthen how it came into workspace and Etclike that just transferring into likewhat is your program missioncollaboration is is going to be the keylike if you are unable to collaboratewith people communicate with people kindof likelet them discuss about the details backto you back and forth It's never gonnarun the business is never gonna runright that's going to be the keyum so our vision was like when we aretrying to move all our applications andstuff into Google Cloud we also need theintegration with our collaboration toolslike Google workspace like how do we doit efficiently Etc like that ifsomething will go a little bit morefurtherum but that's a high level on like whatI would like to kind of cover todayokay so when companies make the decisionto go Google workspace there's a numberof different reasons a Krishna coveredoff the Y but as you take that Y and tryto map that out to the actual projectVision there's many different thingsthat you can do and focus on soworkspace in itself is a very largesolution uh people usually don't doeverything all at once and so trying tounderstand the priority of what is itthat you want to focus on during youryour initial journey to Google workspaceis pretty important so for CME one ofthe very first things that they wantedto prioritize was a browser-based workuh workspaceand for many companies this is one thingthat they a lot of people focus on ohman I really like Outlook and I'm movingto Gmail but one of the bigger shifts Iwould say is that moving from a legacythick application based mindset into abrowser-based mindset because thebrowser then becomes your portal toeverything becomes your portal to Gmailto all of your file collaboration yourchat a lot of people don't really focuson that part of it and so trying tounderstand how do I then take this thingthat is just historically used forinternet access and make it my mainproductivity application so how do Imanage 7000 browsers across theorganization from an environment whereyou didn't manage any browsers at allhow do I push policies out how do Icontrol access what is context awareaccess and what does that mean forChrome these are decisions that westarted pretty early on but see meknowing that they wanted to focus onremoving the the Legacy mindset ofhaving to push applications throughsomething like SCCM make sure all thepatches were updated moving to thebrowser lifted from an administratorcreative perspective a lot of the painpoints that they had so after we kind ofgot the access out of the way we startedthinking about okay what's next uh Drivewas something that CME wanted to get infront of quite a bit with the gcpprojects that were going on as well asjust general Drive usage within theorganization one of the things that theysaw was that drive was being veryquickly adopted within the platform wellbefore they even made the decision to goGoogle workspace so one of the thingsthat they wanted to do is gather theirarms around that and make sure that thedata that they that they have withinDrive was well within their theirboundaries right see it means afinancial services company as you canimagine there's a lot of governance thatneeds to be put in place for things likethat so making sure that we had a driveforce mentality of okay let's make surethat our DLP is up to date and make surethat we are trying to understand theflow of data across the organization ingeneral and how people access it isreally important and then you know therewas that whole Gmail thing after thefact of you've got this organizationthat has been on Outlook since thebeginning basicallyum and that is a huge mind shift ofpeople to get from something like lookover to Gmail so in in the in the thethree uh cannibal courts and this iskind of how we looked at things and whenwe are trying to Define how do weactually approach an implementation likethis there's a very busy slide that I'llmake sure to quiz every single person onall of the items on here after mysession is done but it's it's it's notreally uh an instant plug-and-play thinga lot of people come into a workspacemigration thinking oh I use Gmail athome I use docs for my kids school I'mgoing to just put it in there and go andthere's a lot of things that you need totake into consideration before youactually do that so the first severalmonths of the projectthe project ran from November to Juneand between November and I would sayMarch or April no one was actually onthe platform other than the project teamthose first few months were all justdiscussing how to make a plan to getthere in a way that is not userdisruptive it's got to be secure I'mgonna do it in a very programmaticfashion to make sure that we areuncovering all the skeletons in theclosetat the time that we were implementingGoogle workspace emo was actually goingthrough a big data governance initiativeas well so this was really anopportunity for us to take what wasbecoming a very mature data governanceprogram and mapping it out directly intothe Google workspace implementationoutside of the tech tech is easy I meanI I know that I had that really busyslide that had a lot of the differentcomponents uh with everything but wenormally seea Google workspace project be a peopleproject and not a tech projectORS don't really fight back like peopledo when you tell a computer that you'regoing to Google they won't say anythingto you but when you make theannouncement that your company's goingGoogle you'll probably get about 40 to60 40 of the people being like that'snot for me 40 of the organization shouldbe like awesome I'm in let's do this Iwant to be the first person on theplatform and 20 of the people that don'treally look at email anyway so to themit's not that big of a deal but there'sa huge portion of people is this is oneof the few projects that you can do asan organization that will touch everysingle member and employee of yourorganization so it's really important tounderstand how we change to Googleworkspace is going to affect bobbinmarketing or gym in finance there's manydifferent things that you'll do to tryto understand if I take someone's Excelaway what does that mean for theirsheets what are the things that theycare about in moving from Excel toSheets one of the different formulasthat they use so we would try tounderstand not only the two impacts thatare changed from person to person butalso the sentiment of it there's gonnato be a large portion of people thatjust again you'll never be able toconvince them that it's it's worthmoving a Google workspace but trying tounderstand the value that they can stillhave you don't want to throw out thebaby with the bathwater and try toemphasize that part of it to them aswell uh was a really big focus on ourocm program and once we kind ofunderstood all the change impacts oncewe understood uh here the the Championsthat we're going to have here thedetractors that we're going to have andhear the people that kind of sit inbetween that allowed us to create andImplement a change program that washighly customized to address thoseblockers address those adoption painpoints and all of that so I'm going tohand it over to Ashley to actually talkthrough how we did the change managementat the at the four stage programit was reallywe were ready to go right that thateveryone had figured out we had evidencethere to support us and then our ownin-house team that partnered together tomake that piece really successful theharder part was the change managementand thinking about that as anorganization and how we could make thishappen in about seven months so we wentfrom ideation all the way to our Globalgo live in a very short period of timewhen they originally told the projectteam that was the timeline weweren't quite sure that that waspossible if I'm being honest you knowwe've never done this scale of a projectbefore so it was a really bigundertaking but in our partnership Ithink we're able to figure out what wasreally important what are therequirements that we actually have thataren't just user preference what's thetechnical need and how can wework together with the organization tomake sure that we are providing theright communication and training sothe biggest part of that was sponsorshipwe started with our CIO as our executivesponsor and that was really key inmaking sure that we had someone near thetop that was supporting this changeoverall so when we had you know some ofthe people those 40 that Derek mentionedpushing back we had the support of ourCIO saying this change is coming let'sall get on board and that kind of fedinto our executiveum steering committeeso our steering committee was more aboutokay how are we technically getting fromone place to the other what are our bigroadblocks how could we move thoseroadblocks when we're thinking about ourrequirements are there things that wecan do from a top-down level to makethis run more smoothly so that was moreon the technical side but then there wasthe executive change committee which wassomething we hadn't really done beforeat CME Groupand this was taking leaders from acrossthe organization in all the differentdivisionsand we made them part of our projectteam this was this was a differentapproach you know a lot of times whenwe're making these big changestechnology is just pushing it onto theorganization we tried to make this moreof an effort that we are in thistogether we are all moving in the samedirection let's make this accessibletogether instead of against each otherso that executive change committeereally served a big role there intelling us when you know somethingwasn't working so smoothly or hey wehave this specific use case over herehow are we going to help us think aboutdifferent ways to solve that problemumso having their buy-in was really reallycrucial they helped us byproviding our Google guides so we alsohad the project team of course but thenwe had our Google guides who wereprovided by that executive changecommittee this was a group of people10 percent of the organization they werenominated by our leaders to be our earlyadopters so they were the ones that camein a few weeks before and started usingthe tool and were there on day onesupporting their colleagues making surethey understood what changes were comingsoI'll get into a little bit about how wekind of phased it out but having thesedifferent layers of sponsorship withinthe organization were absolutely key inmaking everyone buy into this idea thatwe're in this togetherso getting to goyou know the track the product team cutover in mid Marchumthat was about 60 users so we did a cutover and we said okay technically what'sgoing on can we do this andum it went quite smoothly actually youknow we were able to get the projectteam on board these were a lot of peoplethat were excited about it you know theywere working on it they knew why we weredoing thisthat one was easythen we went to our early adopters goliveum this was that group of Google guidesthat I mentioned so that was closer toabout 400 users for usand there was a lot of communication andtrading kind of leading up to that butwequietly in between that turned on drivefor everybody you know it we had driedforabout 800 users before but then we wereable to get that turned on for everybodyand start getting people familiar withthe idea get them excited about usingthis new tool collaborating onlinetogetherum and then we also leveraged ourexecutive assistants in the second phasewith starting their training processall of that led up to our Global go livewhich happened in June that was a bigbang approach we did the entire rest ofthe organization cut them over in asingle weekend so technically it wasvery very impressiveum but there was a lot of training andcommunication thatwent into that so we started with theTrain the trainer sessions so we tookour help desk our customer support groupwe did multiple training sessions withthem theysplit between our core I.T group and ourearly adopters group in terms of cuttingover and then we did weekly executiveassistant training sessions leading upto our Global go liveum lots of live sessions for our Googleguides because our biggest concern waswe were going to get to day one and thehelp desk was going to be overloadedwith calls no one was going to know howto get to their email no one was goingto know where their calendar was sohaving those Google guidesout there identifiable ready to go wassuper important it really helped easethat burden on on our help desk on dayoneum and they were comfortable with thetool already right like so much ofworkspace is just getting in it andstarting to use it and then it's not sobadand actually it's really really cool andeffective and we've been able to do somany more interesting things with our umwith our collaboration now that we're onGoogle workspace things are beingcommunicated differently we were a veryemail heavy organization prior to ourcutoverI think since we've moved we've beenable to do so much of that collaborationin real time in documents in chat inspaces all these different ways ofcommunicating instead of just buildingup somebody's inbox and maybe they'llget to it laterum so today we're really pushing ourGoogle first mindsetwe have a lot of In-House toolsum we don't have a firm date on whenwe're pulling away from any of thoseschools but trying to slowly just pushout okay if you could use a Google toolfirst do it let's find tips and tricksto make this more seamless for you let'stry to make this the path of leastresistancewe also are doing a lot of ongoingtraining and supportso offering tips and tricks classesreal-time Labs we have some differentevents with our Employee Engagementgroups we're offering updifferent ways for them to collaboratequickly and easily uh we haven't alwayson Tech barum so Monday through 2 Tuesday throughThursday uh they are they're availableto answer questions in our uh communityspace so that users are able to getreal-time helpum and then we also have a really nicefeedback loop between our end users andGoogle so there is uh we have a surveyout there that any end user can submitsomeone responds directly to those userswith that survey if they have questionsor concernswhen there are issues that maybe aren'tum easily solvable we have an open lineof communication with Google and we'reconstantly providing that feedback tosee if there's enhancements or differentways that we can think about solvinguser problems sothose are the different ways that umwe're collaborating today I'm going topass it over to Krishna who's going totalk about what's coming nextyeah so before talking about the nextum so far you guys heard about like howusers are trying to adapt to that thingright so now we need to talk about likehow the other applications that we haveat CME Group is going to adopt thischange so two two pieces of it like oneis human being one is the technologylike the other applicationsso we took it in a two-step phaseapproachum the first and foremost thing isunless and until the employees getcommitted themselves to use theapplications it doesn't matter what youwrap around it what you integrate withit it's Never Gonna Flyso you heard about like how the teamsworked in trying to get that engagementwithin the employee groupum I'm just gonna try to kind ofhighlight a few things on like how westarted looking into it on thetechnology side and how to kind of getthat engagement with the people if I uhsome of the few things I can now thecore thing I could tell you is email islike the core Foundation of any companyso we are now actually changing thefoundation without making the buildingfall so that's going to be the key thingright how do we do it we got to make itin a piece by piece basis if you justtake the whole foundation and do it it'snot going to help you guys in any waysand like once you put that foundation inhow do you connect that Foundation backto the remaining floors how do you getthe connectivity flowing and how howdoes the core services like you know ifyou look at your home like all your coreservices are coming from the ground upright how do you do all of those thingsso these are some of the things thatwere continuously going in our mind aswe were trying to implement it the firstand foremost thing that we start to lookinto is like making sure we provide theenough technological ways in trying toaccess that email calendar chat andeverything in one single piece and uhwithout losing the productivityplus not only on their laptops againlinking them together and we all knowthat there is a slight difference on howthings work on your mobile versus yourlaptop right so on your browser sessionsand uh people we we might probably thinklike most of the people already knowGmail everybody knows how to use it butthat's absolutely Incorrect and I cametonight I came to that know to myknowledge only when we were trying tokind of like sit and talk to the users Iasking them questions so there are somany things that are more foundationalthat they have built in the existingplatform that we now have to kind offigure out to move it to Google right sothe first and foremost thing isunderstanding the people how they areusing it and now when you're looking atthe people again I can categorize themin many different categories there'slike technology people they can just gowith anything okay you tell them to usea browser they can do it like when youtalk about the business there are twodifferent categories of people in thebusiness side as well some people likewho actually kind of talk to like yourcustomers prospects and everything theysee it differently and the other peoplewho actually supporting the highermanagement like admin people Etc theysee it differently so we need to kind offind a way to kind of like put thetechnology in front of them that isconsistently Works across all in in aconsistent way across for all of thesegroups so that was going to be the keything right so we took the first step ofmaking the technology available andhaving them access in all differentpossible ways and then now we are tryingto look into like how do we kind ofconnect those applications back intoGmail so that's our next step Where WeAreso some of the things enhance userexperience you know the term itself kindof tells you that I I have it but do youdo I really have it in the way I want itright so we started kind of collectingsome feedback from various users likeyou know what do you guys want to seewhat do you guys what kind of featuresyou are looking for so we can betterwork with Google or kind of come up withways to kind of build custom apps tokind of be able to provide them thefuture that they are looking for rightso that's going to be the key next stepfor us the first phase is done now weare in the second step of like theSecond Step trying to understand whatthe customers are looking for from usand then try to kind of implement thatso that's going to be our more uhcustomer user experience um stuff thesecond thing is the most important thingis app sheet we just started to evaluatethe app Shades why app sheets is becauseI think one good feature that I likeabout in the Google side is it doesn'tmatter whether you do it on theworkspace whether you do it on your appsheet whether you do it on your appscripts or your gcp Cloud transformationapplications that you build on the gcpplatform they all could be connected insome way or fashion it's just likedefining the right Scopes websitesecurity and then getting them all linedup properly then you can make thingshappen properly right so if you want tojust get rid of some of the things thatyou build45 years agoto what what's there in Google the firstthing is mindset you got to change yourmindset on how you say things so thefirst and foremost that we're workingwith the business users are like don'tthink about like how you have done ittoday think about what you wantjust tell us like what you want andwe'll try to provide you the the rightway to kind of make it happen within thetools that we are available so onetypical example I always kind of uh giveis like between a gasoline car and EVcar both just the same job taking youfrom one place another place justbecause you are used to putting gasolineon the other car do you want to putgasoline on this car it's not gonna workright so you got to do somethingdifferent that is a change in mindset ifthat mindset doesn't come along with howwe kind of push the technology it'snever gonna work the people are gonna betrying to put the gas into it and breakit right so so that's where the appsheet comes into play where we aretrying to put the technology in front ofthem by modifying some of the processesthat they have built in variousdifferent applications into one singlearea and connect all your data behindthe scenes see I think that's going tobe the biggest portion of it right soyou can use the various Google productsto kind of connect them look at themanalyze them and all of those things ifwe are not able to connect them there'sno analysis in place you could have seenmany companies like using 15 differentanalytical tools why it's all becauselike data is sitting in like 15 placesso that's a one good thing here like youknow it's like we connect all the datatogether in one single place and thenhelp the possibility of using theanalytic platform that Google providesyou to kind of get into the next stepso the next step here after the appsheets is going to be more on the duotAI I know that's one of the hard topicshere at uh Google next this week it'slike Google view at AI what can it doit's something that we're going to belooking at into more detail can itreally help us can it really kind ofhelp people to kind of be moreproductive than where they are todayum and uh can it make it moreprofessional you know so all of thosethings are something that we're going tobe trying to evaluate along with in theGoogle in the labs that we assigned upfor and see where we can take our nextsteps into and again it's a vast spaceand my concentration today is only onthe workspace side I'm not going totouch anything up with the gcp side ofit but on the workspace side it's prettyclear that they have a big roadmap youcan start with the initial stage of likeyou know help me right I think that's animportant thing like and I don't knowhow many people have spent hours andhours to kind of figure out is this theright way to tell somebody what I'mexpecting them to hear right you knowhope it kind of gives us all thisinformation that we are looking for soagain like we are in the initial stagesof like trying these things out we arenot really implemented anything moreother than thatforeign"
