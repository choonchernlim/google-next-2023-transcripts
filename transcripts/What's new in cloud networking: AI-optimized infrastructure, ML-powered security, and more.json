achieve speedSimplicity and security at the same timeit's time to redefine how yourapplications are connected secured anddeliveredit's time for a new network paradigmit's time for cross-cloud networkinggood morning and welcome everyone thisis I know an early morning showI had asked for a time later in the dayand they tell me no networking is soimportant it's a fabric thatinterconnects and makes all gcpapplications work so we want yourundivided retention you get the morningslot uh I am maninder Singh samvi uhvice president and general manager hereat Google Cloud for cloud networking andalong with me I'm going to have mycolleague Nicol Kel Shaker and we havecustomers like Walmart sharechat andAlex from broadcom that will be talkingand joining me on stage herenow you saw the video Cloud networkingis a thing it's real and it's now andI'm here today in my session veryexcited to share some news and updateson what Google is doing to address thisevolving need of cross-cloud networkingwith Google cross Cloud Networkas you all know roughly about 64 percentof Enterprises have already deployedmulti-cloud strategiesand there's a new inflection point withAIML that's going to fundamentallytransform not just the way we live butalso how we work in our workspaceAIML is going to fundamentally changeour entire experience right from thetime we get up we deploy applicationsand we go backwith the growth of AIMLwe believe that fundamentally how youbuild deliver and secure yourapplications is going to be verydifferent on how it's done todaya very early research from analysts havesuggested that 31 of developers aregoing to look at a new Cloud to leveragegen AI capabilities so the notion ofmulti-cloud is going to be much morecomplex much more hard to achieve and wewant to make sure we simplify all ofthis for younow cyber security is super importantespecially in the cloudlast year 76 percent of Enterprises gota breachand an estimation of about 3.5 millionis what an average cost of the breachfor was for an Enterprise and obviouslydepending on the breach and ransomwareit could be north of 100 plus million attimeswe do believe cyber security should befront and centeron an average data proc data says thatthere's roughly about 560000 new malware that are seen on a dailybasis you can imagine the volume ofcyber attacks the sophistication ofthese attacks because they are usingAIML technology to create variantsfaster than what your firewalls yourtraditional firewalls can keep up withand here at Google we fundamentallybelieve security should be built inshould not be an afterthought it shouldbe part of everything that we do youwant to be able to secure it and networksecurity is fundamental to anything thatyou do as part of your Cloud securitybecause Network sees all data allapplication transactions that go throughand it's the right place to enforce yoursecurity policiesnow today'sreally not donemeet the needs of AIML multi-cloud orsecurityas an Enterprise you've already builtout hybrid connectivity paradigmsconnecting your data centers yourco-location architectures into the cloudmaking it easier for you to migrateon-prem to the cloud but you've alsoinvested bespoke infrastructure toconnect to every cloud that you areusingin addition to thatyou're also looking at a investing infront ends for your internet facingapplications whether it be from a cloudprovider or from any other cachingengine and a variety of other vendorsthat might be availablelast but not least your hybrid Workforceis the norm we all are working through ahybrid Workforce how do you make surethat you can apply security policies asyou deploy SSEthese are all bespoke Networksthat individually you have to investmanage very cumbersome from anoperational perspective and each ofthese networks per C has one limitingfactor you either have the Best in Classsecurity and you compromise onapplication experience or you try tooptimize for application experience andyou go with good enough securityand we don't like that we want to makesure that you are do not have anycompromise between applicationexperience and security and becauseyou're building bespoke networks withinconsistent security and theoperational burden your TCO is muchhigher than what you would haveanticipated down the journeywhat we would like to introduce todayit's cross Cloud Network it's an openplatformit provides you ml powered securitythat's built in for everything that youdoand it's performance optimized to ensurethat your application gets the bestexperience whether it's for users thatare connecting to your e-commercewebsites or for your users youremployees connecting to private appsthat are hosted in cloud or SASapplications that you might be consumingthe cross Cloud network is an openplatformthat helps you secureprovide consistent securityas well as lower your TCOsorryit's an open platform because you canbring in any vendor any ecosystempartner that you're working withand engage that partner as part of thisjourney we are not asking you to rip andreplace your existing infrastructure oryour existing security vendor you canbring it onto the platform you can usethe same security policies that you'reused to and apply them in the cloudit's an open platform because alldevelopers want to be able to extractthe complexity of networking and move toour services networking layer to Stateservice a to communicate to service b ina secure and simple mannerconsistent security we want to provideconsistent security across all the threeuse cases that I talked about whether itbe co-locations that are applicationsconnecting to the cloud whether it beyour front endsor it'd be hybrid Workforce that'sactually accessing internet SAS andprivate applicationsand we can all we can do all of thisbecause it's backed by Google's largestbackbonethe planet scale Network that we havelet me tell you what the planet scalenetwork is all aboutall Google services that you see searchYouTube and and the niceness of all theGoogle services that we offer runs onthis backboneit's the it has the largest globalfootprint that you can find 38 regions187 Network edges subsea cableInvestments that we've done there'sbillions and billions of dollars that wehave spent we have 200 plus countriesand territories we actually have Edgelocations to host and provide you thatexperience from a global applicationperspectivethe same network that is powering all ofGoogle servicescan now be leveraged by our customersfor their own infrastructurewhich is high performance scale andapplication optimizedimagine five times the size of theinternet at your fingertipsthat's what the Google backbone has toofferas we embark on the Journey of crossCloud Network the three major use casesthat we are going to be focusing onhow do you build distributedapplicationsand make it simple when you'reinterconnecting your cloudshow do you deliver some of theseapplications from an internet facingthrough a global front-end use caseand along the way how do you secureaccess for your hybrid Workforce so I'mgoing to go into each one of these usecases in a bit more detailI talked about the bespoke networks thatyou're building and you see the networkdiagram with co-location or data centersthat are actually connecting into thecloud and multiple cloudsmaking it extremely complex as well as amuch higher TCOwith cross Cloud Networkwe will now be able to provide you ondemand any to any connectivitywhere you can actually connect AWS Azureand the likes of others directly intoGoogle Cloudwithout having to invest in physicalinfrastructure and manage that lifecycle of the infrastructurewe'll be able to provide you 20 timeshigher threat efficacy along the waywhether your application from cloud a istrying to connect to a VM or a gkecluster in gcp you can simply and easilyadd in a firewall and connect to italong this lines we will also be able toprovide 40 TCO savingsnow how do we do this you see a list ofproducts that we are introducing thefirst one being cross Cloud Networkinterconnect this is a managed in uhinternet that we're providing with anSLA bagged it's secureit comes in various variants of 10 gigand 100 gigs and multiples of itdepending on how much traffic and datathat you're looking to movewe also havethe the customers who are backing it upwith Walmart Fortune one and obviouslyYahoo mail and I'll talk about what eachone of these customers are doingwhen you look at this particularinfrastructure we want to make sure thatyou are leveraging the power of whatcross Cloud network has to build eachone of these products even thoughthey're unique Innovations they're alltied together making it simple and easyand consistent for you to use crossCloud Networkobviously we can't do this alone we havePartners like BT and equinix BTobviously we partner a lot as we buildout our Global backbonein order to provide you high performanceand scale globallywe also have the likes of Yahoo mail andyou might have seen this in Thomas'skeynote yesterday hundreds and millionsof mailboxes and the amount of data thatthey're going to be moving into thecloud is not possible without actuallyhaving a direct connect between theclouds and being ensuring that it's SLAbacked and secure along the wayI'm sure a lot of you use Yahoo mail andas you use Yahoo mail I'm sure you'reworried about what happens to my datanow this is a modern way for actuallydelivering some of these applicationswe recommend in our opinion from aGoogle perspective that the servicesbased architecture is the bestwith private service connect you canactually have a producer and a consumerconstructand you can seamlessly abstract theunderlying complexity of networking andconnect to any SAS application whetherit be vertex AI it'd be spanner CloudSQL is something that we just announcedearlier this weekthe likes of alloy DB and othersnow this is a very simple way for you toconnect your producers and consumers TheProducers could be in any other Cloudcould be on-prem and could seamlesslyConnect into a gcp servicenot only that we have an open ecosystemwith mongodb Snowflake and the likes ofothers that if you would like to use ingcp you can connect your applicationsthat might be hosted in any other cloudwe fundamentally believe we have to meetthe customer in the Journey of cloud andevery customer has a different JourneyI'm sure you started some of you startedwith different clouds and starteddeveloping applications it's hard tomove those applications but you want touse the goodness of what Google has tooffer and the open ecosystem that weoffer with our partners and seamlesslyconnect back into that into yourapplicationsespecially around vertex a I'm sure yousaw the demo yesterday super excitingso how do you Leverage The Power of AIMLand The Innovation that Google bringsand leverage it for the application thatyou've already developedobviously there might be some customerswho might say I don't like the producerconsumer constructyou can also do the same and achieve thesame through an application loadbalancerand obviously for folks who are hardcorenetworking they like routing we offerthat too with our NCC product family youcan do route exchanges you can addressany overlapping addresses that might beand we can now interconnect your on-premyour clouds or other categories as wellnow I talked about how importantsecurity is so be really pleased toannounce Cloud ngfw which provides 20times higher threat efficacy than anyoneelse in the industry from a cloudperspectivethis is the test that we ran withcritical high and medium vulnerabilitiesacross exploits command and control aswell as malwareand we have a very high efficacy that wesee not only did we get the bestintelligence from mandiant as well asour partner Palo Alto networks we alsomade it very simplewe have now offering high performanceTLS decryption in our data plane withoutany impact to the firewall because we'vetaken that function and embedded it intoour virtual stackyou can integrate this particular filewithout having to make any routingchanges and I'm sure you've allstruggled as Network Engineers on if Ineed to deploy a firewall and animicapply comply with my security policiesas an Enterprise how do I do that easilyand simply we absolutely be able tooffer that as wellwe also allow you to do tag basedpolicies you can tag a workload or adatabase store and you can set thisparticular store applies with a securitypolicy a and we will automatically takecare of thatI'm also very pleased to announce we arethe first ones in the industry toactually announce somethingbeyond what a cloud ngfw would do aroundnetwork security posture controlthis is basically being able to applysecurity policies at an org level sothat you have individual projects thatyour different business units might beadhering toeach one of them get consistent policyand cannot change that particular policybecause that's controlledat the same time we also provide IEMprovision tags and a layered incidentreport for sock we're really pleasedwith what we have done here from asecurity perspective making it simpleconsistent and easy for you to be ableto connect distributed applicationsfrom any cloud or on-prem to to leveragethe services that gcp has to offerwith this I'll invite Gerald and nikhilto come join me on stagegood morning Generalgood morningthanks for having us hereum yes so everyone knows Walmart largestretailer in the world Fortune onecompany we're really happy to haveGeneral here on stage I just want tostart off General I'm sure the Republichere would like to know what is GoogleWalmart's Cloud strategy and how is itevolving sure sure so uh as many know wewe went on this journey of themulti-cloud the multi-cloud journey isthe multi-cloud setup that we have isbasically uh three cloud serviceproviders across three regions acrossthe us so we go across the west regionthe central region and the east regionrightuh the whole aim of this is to enable uhour customers to move workloadsand place them in places in the cloudservice providers that enables best ofbreed Services it provides low latencyprovides better application performanceso we leveraged our private Cloud whichis a fairly large size of about millionCPU cores plus we use Google Cloudplatform and we use a third-party cloudservice provider as wellso that's a little short summary of ourmulti-cloud strategy which goes acrossthe three regions that's a very complexCloud strategy I'm sure working withdifferent vendors it's very hard tostitch all of this together what are thechallenges that you've seenthat have inhibited you to accelerateyour speed of innovation that's correctit is challenging uh our goal the maingoal of the multi-cloud strategy is toaccelerate Innovation and provide valueto our customers in the stores andonline right with uhstable and high reliability numbers sothat was our main goal to go in thisdirection the challenges we were runninginto is we we set up our private cloudsvery strategically across the Us closeto our customers right so we wanted toreduce the latency so now from theprivate clouds we could reach uh theconnectivity to Google or theconnectivity to the public clouds wehave the private connectivityconnectivity available right within theconnectsthe challenge came where you have to gopublic Cloud to public cloudinterconnectability and our goal was tokeep it at low latency so that ourcustomers are not impacted with latencyright so that's uh that was one of thechallenges and then the other one was uhwhen you're going from the old way whichwe had was yet to go from one cloudprovider to our power point of presenceand then hooked into back into the othercloud provider right so you're goingaround this hairpin which createdlatency plus you're having the additionof managing your pops the egress costall that adds upwow so Gerald that's when you reachedout to us and we started working oncross-cloud interconnect and you wereone of the earliest adopters of thisproduct so tell me what was valuable inthat partnership and how is walmartyleveraging this sure sure so yes we wereuhwe reached out to you guys and youalways it was super helpful thecollaboration was great uh we wanted togo from a public cloud provider toGoogle directly by awarding The Hop sothis helped us to reduce the latency uhit gives us a solid reliability of 99.99percent plus it reduces the cost for usand it helps one hop and egress outcoming out from our pop so all in allthis helps us a whole lot right now andwe can do this across the region so wedo this in east west and Central allright thank youyou heard munender talk about the crossCloud Network you have seen thepresentation you have a little bit of apreview how are you going to takeadvantage of some of the other newcapabilities like PSC and security andall of these in your roadmap goingforward what are your thoughts so whenwe build this connectivity between theclouds our goal is not to just use itfor Network right so we want to leverageand push the bar uh or raise the bar Iwould say so now we plan to use this forstorage we plan to use this for the newGoogle apis that are being released outto go across the cloud providers and wealso plan to use this for all the AIMLdata that goes across these clouds so asyou guys release more services we'regoing to keep pushing itperfect thank you General good luckthank you nikhilthank you looking forward to thepartnership so so nikhil like everyonehere probably is wondering hey crossloud networking is a thing is it realcan I see your demoyes absolutely thank you munender so asyou talked about cross-cloud networkingvertex Ai and everything and I'm goingto try to bring this to life let me setup the demo it's a recording but what weare going to see is we have anapplication running in ec2 which isgoing to call a Vertex AIbackend over the Internet first and thenwe are going to migrate that applicationand make it work over a cross-loudnetwork so you can do this privatelyso with that in mind let's take a lookfirstI'm just entering my name and I'm askingthe model through this chat bot this isactually running in ec2 at this pointwho are you it is actually response backsaying that it's the Palm 2 modelrunning in vertex AI on gcplet's ask you to write a poem aboutCloud networking of course this personis thinking and has written some Rhymeswhich if you are careful LL Cool J willbe rhyming to later tonight at the partyso make sure you go to the party so nowthat we've seen that we are going tomigrate this over to cross Cloudnetworking what we are going to do isyou have AWS we have a cross Cloudinterconnect in between a PSE endpointwhich talks to vertex AI you need to dothis so you can actually privately movethe datafrom where closest to the so that canlearn and be able to deliver thissecurelynow once this is all set up we haveactually accelerated it and I'm going towalk you through a couple of screens AWSconsole where you have a direct connectrunning in Frankfurt region this is inAWS it is pre-configured if we try to doit in real time it will take timeand if the Google console we have acorresponding interconnect Port which isalso in Frankfurt region we haveestablished bgp sessions between both ofthese so that you can now communicatedirectly from gcp to AWS we can do thisover CCI even with Azure oci and othersand now that it is done we are going toset up a PSE endpoint we reserve an IPaddress for private service connectwhich can be used for this particularapplicationonce that IP address is reserved weactually set up the PSC forwarding ruleto vertex AIand that's the next commandonce that is done we should haveconnectivity between gcp and ec2instance which can now privately overCCI connect and reach out to vertex AIso all the communication is secureand done over a high bandwidthsle-backed Networkwe'll flip over to the AWS console whereyou have a route back to the 10.10network the private Network RFC 1980Network back to the gcp forwarding Ruleand nowto conclude let's ask you to writeanother poem about crossover networkingthis time andthere you goso what you have seen is that we canestablish private connectivity to gcpfrom any cloud and allow high bandwidthSLA baggedcapability so you can move the data towhere the application or the SAS serviceresides and be able to deliver this in avery efficient manner and that bringscross-cloud Network to life perfect thisis awesome thank you plus for nikhil andgeneralif you're looking to write poems usingvertex AI or develop new applicationsyou can do it in a much simpler and easyway which we believe is the modern wayof what networking would look like inthe clouddo keep in mind like this is just thestart of a journeyand as nickel pointed out it is so easyto establish connectivity as a producerconsumer construct using PSE not havingto worry about underlying complexinfrastructures route exchanges I meanthose are important but this is a muchmore easier simpler way of providing theservicenow coming to my next use case we'regoing to deliver front-end applicationshow do you do thatyou have multiple multiple front endswhen you're looking to go Globalcapacity reasons capability reasons andyou might have multiple vendors thatyou're working withwe want to be able to introduce a crosssound Network that actually delivers theglobal front-end with ML power securityour Cloud armored product the first inthe industry to actually have being ableto leverageml models to be able to protect againstmassive DDOS attacks and you might haveseen some announcements that you've donein the LA in the last couple of you know12 monthsyou also hear broadcom at the showtheater actually talk about how Cloudarmor has helped them prevent many ofthese DDOS attacks so please go listento them you'll realize what the valuewe're bringing in how our ml models areable to mitigate some of these attacksthe second biggest Advantage obviouslyis 240 cost saving as you consolidatethis multi-product from CDN to Globalload balancer to the ability to forsupporting ml powered security with uhCloud armor you can now consolidate allthese capability in the single unit andbe able to consume it globally at theglobal backbone footprint that Googlehas to offerwe also invested a lot in terms ofcustomization and programmabilitybecause we all we fundamentally believethat every customer is different eventhough you might have a web applicationbased on your vertical needs you want tobe able to have that level ofcustomization for your web applicationso very pleased to announce the serviceextensioncapability on a global load balancerit's it's it allows you to inherent andcustomize your web application and wesee at a data plane level seamlesslybeing able to integrate it with anythird party offering that might be thereso you see partner solutions from asecurity logging monitoring you can docustomizations from a message uhtransformation or traffic routing we'repartnering with human traceable brightinsight and Landis gearthis is amazing whereas you bring all ofthis together with the programmabilitycable they're making it easier so Iwould like to now inviteour share chat customergaurav to come on stageand give us a brief overviewwelcome gaurav thank you[Applause]thanks a lotum excited for you to be here I know youflew all the way from India as many ofyou might not know I think it'll behelpful God if you could just explainwhat sharechat is about and the level ofscale and performance that you have seenin terms of subscribers and thecomplexity in your business sure yeahthanks Melinda thanks for delighted tobe here so uh sharechat is basicallyIndia's largest homegrown social networkwe are humbled that every month morethan 350 million users come to us toshare content Express discover Trendsopportunities and then build communitiesand we are have been on this journeywith gcp for a long time and uh you knowreally excited to be part of it yeahand I think share chat I mean the levelof scale the level of subscribers youcan see you can't really you need abackbone you need the platform and theglobal edges that are globally availablecan you tell me something more aboutyour architecture because the level ofskills that you're operating at there'sa very few companies just like thefortune one Walmart complexity anddistributed applications how does yourarchitecture have to evolve how is ittoday and how how does it have to evolveyeah so one of the unique things aboutshared chat as a social network is thatyou know what we allow the users to dois engage with the platform in thelanguage that they're most comfortablein right so we support 15 differentlanguages uh Indian languages andum essentially what happens is that whenyou look at the scale we're talkingabout serving close to 300 billion videoviews you know and um and so massivescale you know we're talking about likehalf a million requests per second atour Peakum so the core infrastructure the backend is built on microservices running inGT okay we use both Google managedServices as well as self-hosted serviceson the client side of course it'sAndroid iOS web applications but moreimportantly at that scale the contentdelivery is a very important problemthat we have had to solve so if the waywe've solved is is it is we've gotmultiple different CDN vendors that wework with Googlemedia CDN being one of the key pillarsand you know it's a very unique andchallenging problem in the sense thatwe've got users who are coming on a verypoor Network maybe from some remoteVillage from a 50 device all the way tolike you know fifteen thousand fifteenhundred dollar iPhone so there is a hugerange of device types Network types andso what we do is we've built a systemwhere in real time we detect howdifferent cdns are performing wecontinuously monitor them and then basedon the network or the ISP that the useris coming fromum you know theirIP NGO location and what kind ofperformance they're getting on adifferent CDN we dynamically route themto those to the best CDN that's possibleuh because you know as you can imagineuh for us the user experience uh and youknow our content is text video uh shortform video long form video imagesum you know some of the key metricsreally drive the user experience and theuser attention so how quickly a videoplays uh what the buffering is like whatthe error rate is like all those have avery direct impact on our userexperience and consequently our businessmetrics right so we have seen that evenyou know 20 millisecond differences willcause users to drop offum and so we've really really optimizedfor that around and and Cloud CDN hasbeen you know one of our great Partnerson the media Syrian and we and we doappreciate it I mean this is amazingthat your entire business model works onensuring that the experience is metright it's amazing likeum can you you heard about class CloudNetwork you saw what I talked about interms of global front end how would youhow do you see a road map evolving yeahso for us I think the main thing youknow when we look at ourselves as abusiness it's all about you know userengagement user growth so there's a lotof innovation happening there but thereis also a very important element ofum building a business which is verycost efficient and uh and we want to getthe best of breed from all the differentCloud vendorsum and so in that sense like you knowclass Cloud networking fits in reallywell because we've looked at uh you knowwe've been multi-cloud from a cloud cdnsuh viewpoint but from the point of viewof like other workloads that's somethingwe want to experiment with very activeso I'm quite excited about Cloud uh youknow cross Cloudum you know of course being uh you knowcustodian of a lot of the usersum you know information we definitelyyou know take security very seriously soI'm very excited about you know thesimply verification that a lot of theservices that you've talked about willbring in here so that's an importantarea for us as well and in general youknow compute and scaling it a very costefficient manner is an important aspectfor us because that really helps us uhbuild build a strong business where youknow the cost to serve the user is iscontained and you know the users get avery good experience yeah perfect thisis really helpful as you heard like herechat social media whether it be vodslive streaming super apps whether you'retrying to do shots user experience is sodamn important to get this this rightand security along the way is going tobe really really important so if youhave similar applications whereexperience is important cross CloudNetwork can definitely help you make itsure that the delivery for theapplication is optimal it's securedalong the way and if you have tocustomize your application with anythird party we absolutely allow that asan opening system big round of applausefor URL and thank you gauravuh going to my third use case this isabout hybrid Workforce we want to makesure we extend the same level ofcapabilities to our hybrid Workforcewhether they're working or from a remoteuser from a branch or a campusinterconnecting through your co-locationor through your data centersnow here we obviously want to build onthe open ecosystem that we have todaywhenever you're trying to deliver thisservice for your employees you have tochoose between security or anapplication experience it's very hard Imean these are employees and the resultin direct productivity impact if theapplication experience is not that greatespecially as more and more applicationsget into a SAS form how do you providethat seamless security that can go withthe user independent of where he or sheconnects fromwe're very pleased to announce somePartnerships here from our SSE stack wehave Palo Alto networks with Prismaaccess then that is now hosted and it'salmost in terms of thinking of it inyour VPC so not only are you deployingit for app to app communication you cannow also extend that to be able todeploy for a user to app or user tointernet or user to SAS kind of anapplication we also work with other ngfwvendors so that we know for a fact theremight be customers in different Journeysthey might be looking at an SSC stackwell at other times you might be lookingat a traditional ngfw stack we partnerwith the market leaders starting from 49Cisco Palo Alto networks as well ascheckpointand the challenge obviously is how do Iconnect my branches and bring thetraffic and land the traffic onto thegcp networkand we work with all sd-wan vendors anybranch any router that you might havewhether it be from Cisco from juniperand the likes of others we can bring andonboard that and seamlessly integrateand we've launched this about two yearsago with the sd-wan integration as wellopen ecosystem the advantage you get isconsistent security at the same time youget 35 percent Improvement in userexperience and that's predominantlybecause depending on where the SASapplication is hosted it traverses theGoogle backbone which is secure highperformance and globally availableinternet on the other hand you can dothis very similarly across the Internetit's unreliable you don't actually havean SLA security you will have to putyour own security Hooks and it'sunpredictableso with this class or network you cannow bring in your hybrid Workforce andgive them the same level of experiencethat you would want and with this Iwould like to invite one of our partnersthat we've been working very closelywith Alex from Symantec by broadcomgood morning Alex[Applause]how's it going it's going goodum as you can see I'm sure our audienceis wondering hey we've started on thisjourney of cross Cloud Network howimportant hybrid Workforce is if you canjust outline like at broadcom how youare looking to secure with your SSCstack uh the hybrid Workforce and howyou can provide consistent security withno compromise to application experienceas we go into that discussion I kind ofwant to talk a little bit about how weeven got here in the last four yearsright you know you can't talk about thecurrent implementation and the desirefor a lot of large Enterpriseorganizations well talking about whathappened four years ago you know priorto four years ago everybody was on apath to digital transformationum but covet hit and it got rapidlyacceleratedso four years ago you heard a lot hearda lot about zero trust sassy and thensubsequently SSE and that was really totake the workforce remoteand be able to implement securitycontrols in with a great user experiencein the same way that Hub and spokesecurity had existed for you knowprobably over a decade prior to thatnow as we move four yearsforward to the present everybody'scoming back on premises but not fullyright The New Normal is hybrid and thechallenge there is really taking a lookat what was implemented from a hub andspoke perspective as well as acloud-centric implementation forsecurity and really combining thembecause the the biggest challenge forour customers for all customers or allthe users is that when you are trying toimplement security the the biggest enemyto that is complexitywhen your applications are sittingwithin DC's sitting in SASsitting in private data centers sittingin public cloud and you're implementingsecurity measures with different typesof policies and different types ofproducts uh in different paths for froma network perspective it causes thatcomplexity causes abilities toto enable those 74 percent of breachesfor organizations so so that's how we'reapproaching we have been approaching itat Symantec over the last four years wasuh you know implementing sassy and SSEin such a way that enabled our customersto be able to toimplement the same policy controlsinvisibility regardless of where thoseapplications have beenwith CCN that that accelerates it CCN iseffectively sassy on steroids theability to have a single stack sittingthere that that allows you to trafficcop your network and then having yoursingle security policy set of securitypolicies whether to data or threathanging off of that regardless of whereyour applications are and regardless ofwhere your users are is very powerfulI like your tagline CCN enables sassy onsteroids with no compromise toapplication experience now we can't endthe talk unless we talk about AIML youheard about all the goodness and theinnovations that you're bringing from aneiml perspective do you have any plansto use some of this in your product toenhance that user experience in thesecurity efficacy absolutely semantichas been you know at the Forefront ofAIML over the last two decades uh youknow we introduce things around datasecurity or using Vector machinelearning you know more than more than adecade ago uh the idea now is reallytaking it to the next level right youknow your threat actors are are alreadylooking at things like generative AI toreally kind of just celebrate theirability to put out malware and suchon the flip side all of the securityvendors including Symantec are alsolooking at that to protect to helpprotect against it and so being able toLeverage The partnership that we havewith Googleum you know again another history lessonafter uh after Google joined broadcom wemoved our entire infrastructure toGooglesemantic is 100 Google you know a GoogleCloud customer as well as a partner andbecause of that we're able to leverage alot of those Technologies and we're workwe've been working with Google over thelast I would say nine months especiallyspecifically on Tech Palmso we're really excited can't can'tquite can't quite announce it just yetbut next next month we're going to beannouncing the the you know our abilityto our our semantic AI which is builtupon SEC Palm for yes that is exactlywhat we want our customers I'm sureeveryone's wondering here SEC Palm isgoing to be a real big example of howour customers are using the goodness ofwhat Google has to offer from an AIMLperspective integrated into theirproducts and offer The Best of Beautycapabilities and it hangs right off ofCCN yeah thank you Alexthank you[Applause]I like what Gerald ended withCCN enabled sassian steroids consistentsecurity no compromise to applicationexperiencenow in summary cross Cloud Networkobviously you know we can have up to 35percent user experience up to 40 percentlower total cost of ownership with nocompromise to security with 20 timeshigher threat efficacy than ever beforewe also have Priceline that you mighthear in future some of the otherKeynotes they'll talk about how they'releveraging cross-cloud networking andhow important it is and they're going toleverage some of the capabilities that Italked about in their infrastructure aswellin addition to cross Cloud Network wealso havea bunch of new Innovations I thinkyesterday you might have heard Thomastalk about titanium offload system thatbasically provides high performance forC3 VM family we have other innovationsthat are coming in Flight that we areannouncing and launching they obviouslyhelp you make your
