Closerthere we go okay that'll doall rightumwell my name is has to make summerGoshen I work uh Google cloud and I leadthe partner marketing team that workswith generative AI partners and so gladto be here today with our distinguishedguestsfrom box from glean from workday folksthat are all great Google Cloudcustomers and partners part of ourgenerative AI ecosystem open ecosystemproviding great Solutions greatInnovation choice to all of our virtualcustomers so the topic today is allaround the Enterprise and generative AIfor Enterprise use cases Enterprisecustomers how we're going to maximize itand uh and and roll it into ourenvironments so we'll have a set afterintros we'll have a set of preparedquestions here for the for the panelwe'll try to save some time for live q afrom the group as well but let's goahead and start and we'll start with youKeith and from from box and have you allintroduce yourselves and uh yourcompanies and and what you do absolutelythank you my name is caitan kittur I'm aVP of platform and Integrations at boxat box some of you may know we developenterprise software for secure contentManagement in the cloud andcollaboration and my role specificallyat boxes I lead our developer platformapis developer relations and partnerIntegrations team and I'm really lookingforward to the discussion socool hi everyone I'm Eddie I lead our AIteam at glean at glean we're trying tobuild and bring workplace search andassistant to everyone who works on acomputer so our customers range fromstartups like us all the way up into youknow large Fortune 500 Enterprisecompanies my team at glean specificallyon the engineering side works on makingour product intelligent so obviously thetopic here today is is near and dear toheart and before glean I was actually atGoogle and I was I was on the brain teamso it's nice to be sort of back here inthe fold talking to some ex colleaguesuhcolleaguesgreat good morning everyone my name isJosh Lannon I'm a vice president withworkday we're a leading provider of HCMand financials in the cloud essentiallywe allow companies to manage their mostimportant assets their people and theirmoneywe've got 8 000 plus developers atworkday and my team builds internalplatform technology allowing them tomake the most around documents contentand messaging as part of the workdayexperiences and we've been working ongen AI enablement across our productsfor the last six seven months or sogreat thanks welcome to you allso but before we kick off with our firstquestion I thought maybe we would umtake a couple minutes to hear from theaudience and just check by a show ofhands how many of you here with us arealready using generative AI Tools inyour uh in your work environment todayby show of handsokay all right good good number I'd saywell then let's start um with uh witheveryone here and let us know for foreach of you how your companies areleveraging generative AI today and howis Google Cloud factoring into thatyeah soum at box uh there are two or threeareas where we are using uh gen AI umthe first one is developer productivityand essentially uh looking at how Geniahelps us uh the developers become moreefficient so for example in uh we areexperimenting with code assistance weare looking into how Jenny I can help uswith epr documentation uh generatedocumentation and also absorb it make iteasier for developers to absorb it weare experimenting with uh test scriptswe see a lot of potential there to sortof improve our test coverage as well asthe right test cases and so on sothere's a big big sort of area therearound developer productivity where wesee a lot of potential and we are sortof working our way through that thesecond one is we announced box AI uhessentially it's a set of capabilitiesleveraging Advanced di models embeddedin our box product portfolio and this iswhere we also partnered with Googlewhere we are including advanced GoogleAI models essentially to classifyextract metadata and ensure that we helpemployees collaborate and interact withcontent in a much more effective way andthe third one actually is quiteinteresting it's eat your own dog foodas I say is we are also looking into howAI can help improve our own businessprocesses right so for examplesales operations is an area we have tonsof meetings not everyone attends themeetings but they want to sort of getcontent from those meetings so withtranscription Services uh imagerecognition and so on with metadata tagswe sort of have now created a workflowwhere employees can go and they cancheck meetings they didn't attend andquickly sort of go to the point wherethey you know which is content that'saround even for them and sort of taketake it from there so various differentways in which we are working with Gen AIgreat thanks Keith yeah good Joshoh I'm sorry it's okayum I think just just building off ofwhat uh Caitlin said productivity issort of the the clear obvious placeum where we feel like over the past ninemonths to a year we've been thinkingabout how generative AI fits intoglean's core productum and sort of using that internally andfiguring out where those use cases areso that core productivity whether it'syou know answering questions moreclearly simply more quickly unlocks TimeSavings rightum but I think that the sort of largerupside is this sort of new capabilitiesthat come with this technology so ratherthan sort of simple question answeringleveraging the sort of lightweightreasoning capabilities of these modelspairing them with knowledge stores uhretrieval engines that we've beenworking on for several years to actuallyenable sort of complex flows rightrather than issuing something simpletrying to solve that sort of simpleemployee taskhelping users sort of Express morecomplex things that might require goingto multiple pieces of informationtalking to multiple people and pullingthem all together being able to expressthat sort of higher levelhigher level intent or higher higherlevel question is something that we seethe the recent generative AIcapabilities enabling so that's whatwe've been trying to push into our coreglean product and using it every day inthe companynow Jeff yeah you know building on thatit's uh very similar for us on the firstside of the coin it's the products thatwe build and we've spent a number ofyears working with Google foundationalmachine learning models to enhance ourproduct experiences and this year it'sabout really looking for that slightlymore transformative capability thatcomes with Gen AI using the vertex apiswe've started experiment with finetuning in order to be able to delivermore differentiated experiences so wewere very proud at the keynote at thestart of this conference to announcethat we've started to build out somecapabilities for consumers of work to dothings like generate job descriptionsusing generative AIand really save them enormous amounts oftime and energy and that's just thefirst of many things we're doing on theproduct side and then secondlyinternally it's just an amazing set oftools it's both engineering teams thatare getting code assistance as well sortof looking at well how do we transformthe lives of product managers who needto synthesize product research or writerequirements or how do we enabledesigners to kind of quickly takeadvantage of all these image generationcapabilities and quickly modeling anddesigning out the experiences so itfeels like it's a great technologybecause it touches so many differentdisciplines in the Enterprise and that'sthat's something that we don't alwayssee and I think it's very very powerfulgreat so so one of the things that'scome up a lot in conversations withcustomers all week is is where to getstarted everybody gets it right it'sgreat opportunity use cases are justexploding but but where do I start howdo I start so you know question for eachof you is what are you all doing in yourteams to to bring customers along andand what are you seeing in this earlycustomer adoption go ahead and startingwith you Ethan yeah so um as I mentionedearlier so box we deal with contentCloud management and collaboration andin Enterprises IDC just released areport saying 90 percent of Enterprisedata is over 90 is unstructured whichmeans it's scattered all over the placedifferent apps and so on and oursoftware essentially helps customerssort of make sense of it collaborateshare that data and and you know improveproductivitywith generative AI we can take that tothe next level and we've sort of seenthree main Trends and uh Focus areasthat we are sort of working on the firstone is business insights so how might wehelp customers out of all this datathat's scattered call out specificinsights ask questions summarizedocuments sort of figure outworkflows and so on so that's one bigarea around insights the second one isaroundum create content generating uh usinggen Ai and this is to do withyou know you can feed it meeting agendasfor example or emails and sort of createdrafts and essentially so it's a mixturethat goes across multiple functions toyour point whether it's in product salesmarketing uh creating content duringusing gen AI is is a pretty big thingthat we are seeing and we are sort ofworking on that we announced in fact aproduct on that which is uh our notesproduct where you can create contentusing that as well and then the thirdone is uh automating business processesand this is essentially creatingtemplates uh classifying dataclassifying uh documentsum extracting metadata and so on and sothis is also an area where developerscan leverage apis and sort of extend andcreate sort of workflows that they couldnot previously and so our discussionswith customers are on these three pointsand we are sort of focusing our productefforts on this as well and we'veannounced a couple areas here as wellokay yeah yeah I'd sayum you know these these sort of usecases or or new product experiences thatcan be enabled are are generally cominginto Focus but there's sort of anunderlying set of concerns that we hearfrom customers two two big ones oneum like where is my data is it safe youknow with these generative AI modelsgoing outside of this environment uhwhat can we do with that and that's abig picture of where us working with gcpand with Google has made that story alot clearerum being able to you know serve ourgenerative AI our inference requestsagainst Palm within gcp sort ofcontinues the natural security storythat that we've been building and sothat's a huge huge Boon to us the secondpart of the the data safety is you knoware are these llms training on my dataright and again these are the concernsthat underlie all the optimism of whatcan be doneum and and so we've had to sort ofreally educate our customers work withthem to to help help them understand thenuances of how such a system might bebuilt right you know fine-tuningtraining llms is really powerful butit's also very scary right you sort ofin the Enterprise you have permissionsfor information you have access controland it's still an open research questionhow that might factor into the trainingof these models right and so we'vedesigned that glean sort of a verycareful way to pair permission safe sortof core search AI with generative Ai andthat's what's enabled us to sort of helpthese customers feel comfortable youknow as we talk to customers withhundreds of thousands of employeeshundreds of billions of dollars ofRevenue they they feel comfortableenough to understand that those twoconcerns are sort of met and can sort ofharvest the upside those use cases thatKathy was talking about huge yeah thanksyeah I mean I think one thing that wehave in common is that we do serve theneeds of a variety of companiesincluding the world's largestorganizations and so those concernsaround data compliance governancescalability are very much therepeople talk about generative AI as beingone of the biggest Transformations thatwe're going to see in our lifetimesaround technology I believe that's truerivaling the cloud uh mobile possiblyeven in the internetand I think what's interesting aboutthis inflection point is that thetechnology is so accessible so even whenI'm talking to our largest Enterprisescompanies that might classically bethought of as slow moving they're movingvery rapidly in this space so there's aton of experimentation going on and atthe same time with the largestEnterprises there's a lot of thoughtgoing into what does good governancelook like how do we put in place theright kind of guard rails how do weembrace the right kind of policies sothat we can do this in a in a safe waythat you know all of our customerscollectively need to see to move forwardokay any other comments about datasafety this big topicyeah you know just to build on that Ithink one big threat that I see talkingto customers is there isconcerns around questions sometimesconcerns around how is my data beinguseduh also security and privacy right andso one of the things for example we didwas because it was constant right andit's a pretty valid concern it's a newtrend like you say is uh we published uhbox AI principles and essentially thereare the the goal here is to betransparent but focus on three mainpoints the first one isuh the customer controls uh the dataright so they controlled whether theywant their data to be AI capable or notwithin a product right they have theability who is going to use our AIcapabilities or not so they're havingthe full control is one big principlethe second one is around security andprivacy which isumcan my data be used for training in AIor not yeah and give them that entiresort of flexibility and poweressentially to do that and we have builtcontrols within our product to enablethat as well and then the third one isfull transparency right like if you'reusing AI capabilities within the productso how are we using it what algorithmsare you using it what does data usagelook like make these logs available forexample to the admins so they can sortof look at who's using it and so on andso forth so just being open andtransparent has been a big sort of uhunlock for us to get the discussionstarted to then okay make sense now whatdo those use cases look like and whatthe roadmap looks like which I'm surewe'll talk about yeah yeah and and fromthe you know from the Google side we'vebeen hearing all weekwe use the Expression over and over Iknow your data is your data I thinkwe're all kind of locked arms on thiswhere we we're committed to zero dataleakageum throughout I mean if you're any ofyour data your input data your yourmetadata model output your humanfeedback is is completely safe if youyou know fine tuneum train anything of your vertex modelyour data is not used to feed othermodels your data is not used for othercustomers your NATO is not used for theinternet your data is not used for forother Google services your data is yourdata and it's safe and it's kept in inyour in your domain under your controlso I think that'sum where our partners are at as well onthe on this topic yeah I mean I thinkbecause we started with like popularitystarting with the consumer side uh itjust sort of set everyone in this placeof like oh my data is showing up back inthese models and like you know butreally we've all been working withGoogle for a long time on ML and havingthat uh notion that we're justprocessing customers information ontheir behalf it's it's your data yeah uhand so it's sort of resetting witheveryone's expectations like we can dothat with generative Ai and uh I thinkthat's it it's it's sort of intrinsic tohow we workabsolutelyum all right so I want to I want to moveon to someum another kind of interestingconversation top of mind around thequality of what we get out of generativeAi and I thought again to turn to theaudience and and see where folks areyourselves in terms of how you'refeeling about how what is the quality ofof what we're getting um from generativeinsights today with today's tools so ifwe you know artificially create like athree-point scale where one is kind oflow confidence in the quality of thedata three two is in the middle andthree is pretty confident that thequality of the output isum is pretty Sound by show of hands howmany folks would be kind of in the onecategory where you're not so confidentabout the quality of generative AIinsights todaywho'd be in the middle like number twoin the middle and then is there anybodyany threes that are like reallyconfident no it's good I'm good okay Alittle bit of a mapumso for the team here so what whatstrategies can organizations adopt toensure that the employees people areusing the data using the tools actuallyhave the confidence that what's beinggenerated is is believable and is usableand maybe we'll start with ID on thisone yeah yeah I think I think we have tobe really thoughtful you know when weput products and experiences in front ofpeople that are powered by gender of AIwe have to really understand how they'regoing to interpret that rightum and from our experiences at gleandeveloping these kinds of productsum we we found that sort of when youum inform a user sort of what thecapabilities are what what uh context isthere that this system is using to sayanswer your questions that's a reallycritical part of the experience right ifyou're trying to build an assistant in asearch engine that answers questionsabout anything in the company you youbetter be certain that it's connected toeverything right when when users come tothat experience they have a mental modelof their company's knowledge and if yoursystem doesn't match or indeed exceed itthen you're going to be in trouble rightthey're going to expect a certain levelof quality that simply won't besatisfiable rightum so sort of that that extraexpectation and understanding that anysuch system needs to have the rightcontext to answer all these questions oror to sort of inform that productexperience is important and I think thesecond part of that isum aside from sort of the the sort ofaggregation and the the sort ofum sort of collection of what data isthere you need you need sort ofreference ability right and and I don'twant to get too technical but when wewhen we talk about where these answersare coming from or what's actuallyhappening under the hood we need tounderstandum the the sort of source right the sortof source whether it's Source documentsthat are informing the generatedresponse Source informationand and without that there can be noconfidence built by the the user rightyou you'll lose trust you might just goask another employee another co-workerright away like is this actually rightif you can't have a sort of clear lineto point a link back to to where thingsare so we think that that sort ofreferences ability is is also a reallyimportant part of as we continue tolearn and build these General AIexperiences core to understanding thatyeah yeah to build on that I mean I lovethinking about the user experiencearound generative Ai and we have aprinciple about keeping the human in theloop for that experience right soum it's really good to just think aboutlike how do you actually make thathappen because like we followed theexperience going online getting a term aservice and scroll scroll scroll nextright who takes the time to read thatbut with generative AI content we reallywant people to be a little bit morethoughtful uh you know if we'regiving someone a blank sheet of paperand saying we can now generate a jobdescription for you using some data andthat comes back and they hit donewithout reviewing it that's not what wewant to see happen because it might notbe really the right content for thatrole and so we do thingsto sort of bring first-time experienceto new users explaining what it is thatthey're seeing when they work withgenerative experience for the first timeone of the things that we got in thatfirst experience is during the fewseconds it takes to generate that jobdescription for example we actually showwhat data we're pushing into the llm tothe end user we're saying hey it'slocation data it's skills data this isthe input let's do kind of that likereference point so we're kind of gettinga lot of feedback about how to buildconfidence with usersum through just being more transparentand really kind of bringing to light inthe product experience itself what it isthat we're doing behind the scenes in away that they can understandyeah and I think there's this sort oftension between you know you you want toharvest those productivity gains youwant this to actually be a great firstdraft you don't want to rubber stamp itand have it go anywhere but if if itjust requires someone to sort of readthrough the whole thing very thoroughlyagain then there's you've sort of lostthe gains you could have had right andso another strong way to build thisconfidence is simply to make the systembetter right to createum you know a system that's wrong lessthat requires less time to review and wehave to do that carefully right becauseusers as you said when they're in thatproduct experience might not understandwhere we are today but we ultimatelyhave to drive towards a place where theyhave that confidence and the system isactually doing the right thing right andit requires less and less sort ofintervention less and less sort of humanjudgment I mean that takes measurementright I mean we can look at the endresult who got hired or didn't out ofthese outcomes how do we then infer werewe doing a good job with what we werecreating so we we like to measureeverything in our industry we don'talways succeed at doing that I thinkthis is an area where it's just soimportant as you're thinking aboutbuilding these systems to build in themetrics and Analysis so that you canunderstand the outcomes yeah and if Ican add a couple lenses on this so oneis there are areas in in product forexample where accuracy is absolutelyimportant so for example if you're inthe security space and you're using AIto sort of improve the accuracy of yourthreat models uh you cannot say yeahit's okay you know we let couplepercentage Slide by so you got to ensurethat training is that diversity isimportant so to your point around humanin the loop you got to make sure thatyou make sure that diverse viewsviewpoints and the results and all thatare taken care of so that your accuracyis very very high to the level you wantthen there are areas in product forexample where you're using AI notnecessarily for accuracy though it isimportant but to improve productivity tosort of Infuse creativity in the productso for example you can have a productexperience where you're saying hey helpme get started writer's block or you'rein the marketing thing you want to getsome drafts going whatever so what AI isdoing there is help you get started andso to your point on the product side youknow it's important from a productstandpoint to start making sure that aproduct evolves and catches up to AI tomake sure you set the right expectationsfor your users so if you're giving thema summary of a document and you're not100 sure make sure that you cite sourcesright make sure that you can give themprompts to go find out more on their ownand so on and so forth so I think thereare different ways in which this can beimplemented and uh results will vary butit'll still be useful as wellyeah makes sense yeah we just this weekGoogle we'reresponsible AI is a critical componentof for for the for the cloud teamourselves and Tuesday morning and in thekeynote um Sundar announced this NewConcept that we have the only cloudprovider that has digital watermarkingfor images that come out of one of ourmodels so it's basically images arewatermarked can't see it visually youcan't see it the it's not perceptiblefrom from the human eye but tools areable to ferret it out so one of theseearly stages again only from GoogleCloud but an early stage tool to help totry to build the confidence of of usersthat you know there there's there'sunderlying reliabilityum you know security and integrity in inthe source data sogood thank youum all right so let's move on toum employees and employees everybody'sdaily daily workload and jobs and youknow we all know that there are tasksthat can be game changingum with the influx of generative AI sowhat in you know what ways cangenerative AI lighten the workloads ofof employees in the workplace in theworkplace and then how do we measure wetalk about measurement a couple minutesago but how do we start to measure thesuccess the return on on what this isoffering to ourselves and our teens somaybe Josh we'll start with you thisround uh yeah thank youum you know we we hear this too and Ithink we all feel that people areoverloaded with workum and an interesting fact there arethree million people less in the USWorkforce than there were before thepandemic and that trend is not goingaway uh and so when we talk to peopleabout what they want most uh from allthis technology it's time back in theirday the ability to eliminate mundanetasks and really get to the higher valuefor us it's pretty straightforward youknow operating at some scale to sort oftalk to customers and realize wherethey're spending a lot of time and notto keep harping on the same use case butI love it a lot when we're generatingjob descriptions we know that takes onan average an hour or two for ourcustomers to write oneand we do 30 million of those a year onbehalf of our customers so it's veryclear Roi for us to deliver thatcapability and I think it just comesdown to talking to your customersidentifying the pain points finding outyou know those just core metrics aroundtime spent on task and then looking atyou know how do you enable technology toto get that time back yeah hmm how aboutyou kissing for the Box team what whatare your thoughts including productivityand measuring it so um I I'll say allthe back that we are really stages so weare learning but I I would say there aretwo or three areas in the ROI can bedifferent for those areas so for examplelike I said earlier if we are using AIin the developer productivity side yeahwhere we are essentially using Codeassistance we are using it to generatetest cases or API docs and so on you'llmeasureum returns based on developerproductivity and there are very specificsort of productivity metrics eachorganization has around those so I thinkthat's that's one area in which you maywant to sort of go down on and there areit's very specific to that domain thoughthen there are others where we actuallymake collaboration software contentmanagement software right in which casethe objective if you infuse that with AIis to make sure that we give employeestime back or we reduce redundancy intheir Workforce if effectively improvingthat efficiency right and so the way youwould measure it is through time and soon but there are so many other ways youcan do it toothen there is business processes whereyou're using you're creating newworkflows let's say right like I have anexample of mine uh which which I like islet's say you're in the financial uhdomain and a big part of the approvalworkflow uh is that you know customersupload documents tons of documents rightthen there is a manual review process ofthe documents then you make decisionsaround some parameters or some rubricthat you have and then you come back tothe customerwith AI what can happen is as you startloading those documents you can startextracting metadata you can startcreating these workflows that automate alot of this process so that thesedecisions are in some cases automatedsome cases expedited right and so that'san area as well if you're in a salesorganization or customer service forexampleuse AI to essentially go through allthese insights very very quickly whichwould have taken you a lot of time so inthis case you would measure it with withtime save but also the quality of theresponse that you get would bephenomenal right so I think there aredifferent ways in which AI can bemeasured and will add value toorganizations going forwardright any any thoughts yeahum I think you know it's it's measuringproductivity and the gains is not new tous like you know we've been buildingsearch for you know four years now andand we already had to sort of tell thatstory we knew 30 ofum you know time spent by knowledgeworkers as time spent on findinginformation right we knew that wassomething that we could go after andmeasure rightum but now with generative AI you canyou could sort of think about okay oneyes you have the time savings we cantalk to our customers find out that youknow each employee save two to threehours per week with our product but twoyou also can sort of look at verticaluse cases right we have a Fortune 500Telecom provider and they've deployedglean in their call centers right andyou see calls sort of support callsgoing from minutes to seconds right youcan actually measure the sort ofefficiency gains there right you havesort of cases where customers are sayrolling their own internal solution tosolve this problem they have a sort ofemployees spend and time spent on thatand so they were able to save you knowthree million dollars a year annually bysort of leveraging glean instead ofdoing this build solution rightum but but there's also somethingqualitative here there's something aboutuh figuring out how employees arefeeling uh what the kind of work thatthey don't like doing that's beingthat's confronting them every single daythings that are sort of you know thatthat products have the opportunity tohelp with right that help onboarding tomake people feel less lost that helpsort of like like like Josh was sayingthat this sort of wrote work or thestuff that people don't want to do itincreases retention it sort of increasesfulfillment it leaves room for sort ofdeeper deeper work so that's somethingthat we also sort of talk to ourcustomers and our users about to get apulse check on how can we measure thevalue that this is providing yeahgreat and the other no I love the pointyou made I I think this isto allow ourselves to think and considerconsider that one umnot as easily measured but um but realyeahthanks for coming out thank youthanks for joining us thanks to thechannel great discussion reallyappreciate itforeign"
