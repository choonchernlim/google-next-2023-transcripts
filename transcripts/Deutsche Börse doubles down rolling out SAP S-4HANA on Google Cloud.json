30 minutes of presentation15 minutes of Q and Aand I would like to first of all thankyou for being here today afternoon doone or other might see jet lag coming inespecially when you come from overseasat least this is how I feel when youstart working in two time zonesandwe are here today to share a bit a morepractical experience after having hadthis morning a lot of very inspiringKeynotes right the the only thing theKeynotes don't tell you is it doesn'twork in two minutes sometimes it takes abit more time right so and this issomething we are sharing today a bit thethe experience that we had when we atDeutsche berza group implemented s4hanaon Google Cloudfirst about myself so my name is LasPolanka I run corporate I.T at Deutscheberza group and the reason why I'mstanding here is and I again have tosteal a bit the comments from thismorning I started in Legacy land soLegacy land Deutsche version meansthings like Lotus Notes Citrix old sapenvironments and everything elseand when you then go to your teams andask your teams like hey what is the nextstep then people tell you okay from crm4you can migrate to crm7 frombw7.1 you can migrate to BW 7.2 peoplestay in what they knowso the only thing where you can reallyDrive change is technologyand this is where we at the beginningsaid let's not stay in Legacy land let'sreally make the move happen let's usetechnology let's partner with Google andwith sap to make a huge LeapFrog so notsmall incremental steps and alsoleverage the experience that is thereon the other side the expectation wasalso that we built a blueprint ablueprint where many other companiesespecially in the financial industry canuse this and especially when they hearthe same feedback we have been hearinglike it doesn't work it's difficult it'sexpensive and so on that we can showthem look it worked so this was a bitthe the expectation and this is alsowhat I will be sharing todaythe first thing is Deutsche berzer groupI'm not sure how many people notice atleast two I know in the audienceRonaldo's a group[Applause]um Deutsche Bursa translates in Englishinto a German Stock Exchange but it isnot a German company it was founded inthe 15th century so this is where wewere German now we are trulyInternationaland when I get privately asked last whatis what are you working or where are youworking and I say at German StockExchange then people immediately ask melike hey I have some Bitcoin shall Isell them what should I do with myshares and so on but this is not ourbusiness model so this is Hollywood butthis is not our business modeland where we differ is that we run thefull Financial value chain in marketsso means we are a B2B business we arenot a b2c business when you buy shareswe work in the background you don't seeusbut it is incremental for the marketsand typically you have a Stock Exchangein every nearly every countrybut most of the stock exchanges arereally limited to the global marketDeutsche berzer is one of the top fiveInternational stock exchanges sooperating in 60 markets globally andwhen we speak about the value chain wetypically speak about three pillarsfirst is data and analytics so weprovide a lot of data a lot of researcha lot of insights to our investors or tothe investors in general so that theycan take educated decisions typicalexample ESG right so we do a lot ofresearch we share this but we share thisin full transparency with everyonethe second part is trading and clearingwhen we speak about trading and clearingin easy words when you buy a shareit could be that we are in thebackground working on it right and youcan trade a lot of financial instrumentsyou can trade fine you can trade foreignexchange Commodities like gold so forexample we are the only Stock Exchangeworldwide you can buy gold as acertificate and at the end of theduration you can ask for physicaldelivery to your home address forexampleand then the last part or the third partis Post Trading Post Trading has twopillars pillar one is the funds businessso investment funds Pension funds Globalfunds the second is about Securities soespecially when you buy long-standingfinancial instruments then we arebasically your notary we make sure thatin five years you still get your moneybackso this is about the business modelitself more impressive is to look at thenumbersso I mentioned already 60 marketswhat is even more impressive is forexample if we take just the fourthquarter 2022 we have been trading 1.9billion contracts just on the tradingsideeven more impressive at least for me wasto see the annual clearing volume so theannual clearing volume is two times theworld's gross product so we are speaking200 trillion US dollar that every yearis going through all booksand this also shares a bit why it hasbeen for us a very I would say specialcase because we are systemic relevant soyou can imagine if you have 200 trilliongoing through your books if your systemis down only for a few minutes you aresitting in every newspaper not speakingabout the cost of um of such issuesright so we really have to take makesure that resilience is one of our coreprinciples and this was also one of thedesign principles when we started thejourneythe third thing is when looking now abit on the macro environmentyou often hear about financial industrybeing slowbeing back to the last century havingmainframes in their basementhaving high margins but not investinginto technology but when you look at thenumbers FSI is heavily investing and ifyou just take the most current trends socloud and artificial intelligence we arespeaking around 160 billion US Dollarsjust invested last yearso this means the industry is heavilyinvesting and it has good reasons on theone side regulation is constantlydemanding more and the only way how youcandeal with this is technology on theother side you also see that the marketsare changing right be It Mobileeverything goes into Mobile you see thata lot of banks are closing their let'ssay local stores so everything getsdigital Mobile Wallet all these type ofthings and everything works only withtechnologyI would like to repeat also that whenpeople speak about regulation oftenregulation is seen as like oh don'ttouch it regulation is part of ourbusiness model and it's part of manybusiness models right air industry ifyou go to automotive industry Pharmaindustry they're all regulatedthere is no regulator who forbids you togo into the cloud it's now writtensomewhere this is made up by people whotry to defend things and to find excusesnot to do so sorry to be a bitprovocativeso this is where we then decided to gointo the target design and when itreally establish a blueprint and what wefigured out is a lot of people speakabout Cloud but many organizations missthe opportunity about it so mostorganizations when they speak aboutCloud they keep their on-premisethinking in mind and this is both on thesap side but also on the infrastructureside so we said when we do a blueprintit must have on the one side theum really kind of doing LeapFrog on thetechnology side it must be a leapfrogalso on the sap side so we have beenchallenging sap as well as our partnerand the third one it must be regulatorycompliant right so we need to work withthe regulators and this is what we callan industry blueprintsowhenever you start a blueprint you startwith some research and I was evensurprised myself so when I did a bit ofpreparation last week then I was doingsome research on what is the sentimentof Finance industry in the public cloudand you see that the sentiment is stillaround be careful hesitatingbe careful basically about your data soit's really speaking more aboutdo it slowly all right so this is thesentimentit doesn't look better for sapmigrations so when you look at sapmigrations you will see that they failthey are expensive they are slow datamodels don't work no support from sapyou will find a lot of entries 12million entries even if you take asubset of this this is a lot and if youaskcolleagues and peers you most probablywill get the same same feedbackbut for us when we said it's a nicereality check we stillfrom day one said the only way how wecan make big move is to use public Cloudright it's the only technology that canreally help us on the changing thinkingside and also on the changing thingssideand it pays in into agility so it's theonly way how you really get fast rightif you try at this time when we startedthe journey this was the time when youtry to purchase servers it took you 18months to come so there was no time forwaiting 18 months to start a projectyou look at quality so we are in aninternational business 60 markets 80geolocationshow can you with two data centers inGermany and two data centers inLuxembourg do a geographically spreadacross the globe and the last one iscost which is also a move that isrunning around people always say it'smore expensivewhich is not true we'll come to thislaterwhat we said from day one is that we areregulatedso we need to balance a bit to the powerand this is where we set in a verytransparent way from day one we arerunning multi-cloud multi-cloud means wehave two providerswhen we are working togetherbut the objective is not for competitionthe objective is to leverage best ofbreach and to very well integrate wehave a control plane that allows us tomove workloads from left to rightto briefly apologizeso we have a control plane that allowsus to move workloads easily from left torightwe have built a lot of security featuresalso here thanks to thanks to Googlewhere we really started from a designprinciple let's use native features thatcome out of the box so let's not try tobring our on-premise security toolingand move it to the cloudjust to name a fewthe same reality check we did on the sapside so when you look at where is sapmigrations or transformation todaytowards s4hanathen you see this is the latest Gartnerreport is around 25 percentsap terminates formally by 2027 you canpay a bit extra then you get 20 30 butwhen you see five to ten percent ofcustomers are migrating every year itwill not work without a hockey stickand what was also interesting is fromthe German sap User Group there was astatement that only two percent areusing the public cloudwhich was even for me very surprisingbecause in today's timeinvesting still in on-premise isbasically uh I will carefully say ridinga dead horse right so you're justwasting money and resourcesand this is where we or where you cantake the conclusion thatpeopleonly come to on-premise thinking whenthey use on-premise thinking rightanything else so everyone who reallykind of understands what cloud meansboth on the technical side but also onthe working sidecannot come to the conclusions onpremise and this is why people aremissing out opportunitiesand I just wrote down a bit of what arethe typical things you are hearing rightfirst is budget it's cheaper so if werun it ourselves it's cheaper than thecloudyou also hear it's our technology we cancontrol it better people don't tell youthat if they are renting the data centerspace it's also not their data centerright so they are just putting the boxesinand last but not least it's about thefunctional site if you run Sophia forexample we are running at an RTO of twohoursor have been running at an RTO of twohours people were fine with thisbut when you speak about 200 trilliongoing through your books two hours isnot fine because the interest you payfor two hours on such money volumes isimmenseso we said from day one we want to usethe opportunity for cloud and reallykind of take it big because also peoplevery often compare infrastructure toinfrastructure but this is thinkingshort-minded we have to look onoptimizing big right what are thepotentials going forward you canoptimize processes you can optimizeanalytics there's a bunch of things todosecond opportunity securityone of the biggest statement is my datain the cloud are not secure Google orany other one can steal thembut the what people miss out is when yourun in a hyperscaler by Design you havedifferent security levels that you keepup so you are thinking about encryptionthose of you who have on-premise datacenters who has encrypted data in an ownon-premise data center was probablynobody because why should you know itwhy should you need it when you followthe principle I own it rightso by Design you do encryptioninfrastructure level database levelapplication level three times encryptionbeats any on-premise data centerand last it's about resilienceso when we build the s4hana systemwe had the chance to really kind of setas an ambition High availability closeto zero downtime I mean we set zerodowntime a few minutes you always havewe are technically speaking less thanfive minutes if you speak the wholelandscape less than 20 minutes so from 2hours to 20 minutesso meansstart today and not tomorrow so becausewe see that also in the market you re ifyou speak to for example ProfessionalServices it is hard to get the peopleyeah and this is something if you try tofind excuses today you will find excusestomorrowthe second one is manage your risk andmanage your data what people tend to dois they read in the newspaper what isabout risks and so then they try toapply this to your own company but thisis hunting ghostsso it's more important to really thinkabout what is your your risk what isyour company risk what are your companydata what what are the things you needto secure it's a completely differentway of thinking and the last one isreally take time to Market andresilience as a cricket area so ifpeople tell you it has been fine what wehad the last 20 years they have to goback to the design boarda good example is and you typically canalso ask this in a school class how doyou build a data center without buildingoneright and uhWhoever has built a data center you knowit takes two years if you are fast threeyears if you are slow can take also fouryearsif you work with a hyperscaler it takesyou the first time a couple of weeksmaybe a couple of months once you repeatthe exercise you are definitely in therange of a couple of weeks includingeverything micro segmentation Networksmulti-zone setup failover Highavailability all these type of thingsthey come out of the box you don't needto get infrastructure teams in you don'thave to buy Cisco gear or any otherthings it comes out of the boxand this is something where you reallyhave to also take the people on thejourney that are working on it becausethey will always tell you why it doesn'tworkand we have seen this and this is alsowhere we are looking I will come to thislater a bit into even triangulation sowhen you have three data centers how canyou operate this as wellnow this is our Target Blueprint I willnot go too much into detail I think moreimportant is to understand the objectiveand the target picture to be reachednext year is 90 of Corporate Services ofDodge group is running in eithersoftware as a service or as ahyperscaler yeah we are today at a rateof 60 65 percent simply because we stillhave to migrate the one or other systemsomeone asks what happens to the rest ofthe 10 they are subject of decommissionso this is why they are there you don'ttouch them anymore you decommission thembut objective is 90 of corporateservices will run in the cloud and thisis something where we say this is a trueindustry blueprint because the averagethat you see in the market these days isaround 20 to 30 percentwhat do we get I think we spoke alreadyabout high availability and DisasterRecovery we spoke about encryptionfor us the most important part is whatcomes after right because we will seenow the foundation for Innovation rightwhere we can partner with Google we'llcome to this later a bit where we canintegrate Best of Both Worlds right sowe bring sap to the table Dodge to thetable Google to the table and we canstart really Innovation it doesn't workbeforenow comes my favorite topic regulationwhen we speak about regulation I couldwrite you at least a full book ofexcuses that you get also from yourinternal teamspeople are afraid of cloud because theycannot control it it is something newthey hide behind regulations where theysay the regulator doesn't want to by theway this is nowhere written and ittypically starts also with mixing upthings right so mixing up for exampleregulation and lawso if you speak for example gdpr gdpralso is relevant for you on premisethere is no difference with the cloud sothis has nothing to do that needs to bemixed with industry regulationwhat we have been doing is right fromthe beginning also in a very very closepartnership that we said also here wewant to do this as a blueprint and ablueprint means it must be a triple wintriple win means it's a win for theregulator because the regulator as soonas people run exactly the same landscapethey know it is exactly the samelandscape right so they don't have toaudit each and every Institute again andagain because they know they are all thesamefor the banks or for the institutes thesame because if everyone follows thesame standard you can exchangeinformationbut you also can rely on whatever is thestandard is the standout there is nodeviation of iso 27000 for exampleand the third one is for us as a groupbecause we say from day one we can workclosely with regulators and the partnersto not have always all the internalCycles in terms of approval and so onand typically things that are veryspecific for us as the industry is forexample we need to have an exit strategyexit strategy means what do you do iffor whatever reason sorry to GoogleGoogle doesn't work anymore right wheredo you goone scenario second scenario is to speakabout business continuity so what do youdo in case of emergency a market has tocontinue to work even if your buildingis down for example right these are thetypical things we have been looking atbut we have a framework it is working itis effective we have roughly 40institutes that are following the sameprinciple and this is again a blueprintwhat we are looking constantly at isdata sovereignty and here also very veryclear statement wekeep control of all our data yeah sothere is no loss of contractor weencrypt we click controlwe have operational sovereignty becausewe work very closely with Googlewe work with the from an auditperspective from a Control Functionperspective we know what they are doingand they know what we are doing in bothwaysand the third one is softwaresovereignty we run our own software likeyou do in on-premise world and thismeans in short we keep everything undercontrolsothis is kind of what we defined as ablueprint right so we moved everythinginto Google cloud or close towe are running the latest level oftechnology that you can run we havestarted to redesign all our processesand we have a framework that isregulatory relevantand where you can see the results now isto make just a recent example a fewweeks ago we have integrated a newamount a so we have been acquiring acompany and the integration work ineight weeks so eight weeks from firstdesign Workshop to implementing tenantFinance purchasing HR the whole setuptechnology-wise infrastructure wiseprocess wise eight weeks yeahjust to make an exampleso what comes nextthe next the next level is we just had aconversation here today's uh about howdo you bring those words together rightbecause we have seen there's a lot ofgood announcements that happened in thelast two daysand this is something which is up to usnow to see how can we leverage thisthe first one is Harvest on the cloudinvestment run the cloud rightwe'll come to this in a second so eachof them will have a bit of deep lifesecond is evolve best of breed CFOServices yeah so we have given the CFO anew platform nice shiny fast resilientwhat comes nextthe third one is manage data and datatiering so the classicalthinking like hey here's my businessWarehouse put all the data in have thiscontrolled by business Warehouse expertsand so on this is passed doesn't workanymorethe fourth one is generative AI we havebeen hearing a lot about it we startedto also partner together with Google onlooking at three cases closer I willcome to this in a second and the fifthone is triangulation intentionally underanalysis so triangulation for very verycritical scenarios where you say youdon't work with two zones two regionsbut you work with three regions forexample only makes sense for reallycritical workloads otherwise it gets tooexpensiveso let's take the first one run thecloud right and the typical thing iswhere I would say most probably everyonewho touches cloud is starting with liftand shift24 7 you move it in the cloudsthe clock is running and you recognizeit gets expensive but it works by Designbecause this is not the intention ofcloud yeahso it starts applying a bit ofintelligence intelligence means changeyour patternsand changing patterns is a hard work todo so telling the teams please changeyour patterns will not work anything youreally have to work with the teams handholdingand start thinking about what areenvironments you don't need by whentypical example do you need a Sandbox ona Sunday nighthighly likely not if you have the onedeveloper who likes to work Sunday nightyou tell the person to work on Mondaynightthe same is relevant for test systemstest systems in an on-premise World theyrun 24 7 the whole yearnow you can run multiple testenvironments for a week and so on sothere's a lot of potential which iscalled On Demand so this is the nextlevelif you drive it further we are speakingabout Dynamic resizing and also definingschedules right so you start learningpatterns of your userstypical example Monday morning 9 A.Mpeople come in take a cup of coffeesit in front of the PC you will see allthe logins going in on Monday morningFriday evening they go down like this sopeople are off in the weekend typicallyyou can learn exactly those patterns thesame is for international companieswhere you see who is logging in at whichtime right so maybe you will find outthat you have to work until midnight tocater America's region but you don'thave a lot of business in APGand the same is also defining schedulesso certain environments only are usedonce a month and months and closingtypically right and this is where youcan apply a lot of learning and you canreally leverage the cloud and by the waythis works fully automated so we havetoday already the situation if teams areusing certain environments so forexample data cleaning environments theycan spin it up within 10 minutes ontheir own they don't need an I.T servicerequest they don't need to do anything10 minutes they have it running it shutsdown automatically after 48 hours forexample you know a specific use caseand when you have done all of this youhave one Joker and this is you go toGoogle and ask for discounts right butthis typically should be the last thingto do because the most money you don'tmake with the discount the most moneyyou make by optimizing and learning howto do Cloud rightso thenfor the second pillar our CFO the CFO wehave to make friendly because we get themoney or here's the money he has now ashiny system so we have for exampleimplemented a parallel Ledger completelynew accounting system we did a lot ofcleanup and now we start looking intofor example I made a right lower examplestandard for amount a eight weeks forMLA integrationon the left left upper part we startedto use Google AI for accounts payable soinvoice recognition how can youintegrate this into sapand we have started also on theanalytics front the only thing that doesnot work I need to admit getting acontroller out of an SAP BW this issomething that does workthird item is data mesh so also hereclassical pattern of an on-premisethinking I have my business Warehousemany many terabyte everything must be inthis data warehouse what people do isthis business Warehouse is an ownecosystemand people make it so complex you don'tunderstand it anymore so the only way todo is basically put it out of the doorwhat we have started is together withour CTO that we have defined a very verystringent data domain modelso example here but not limited to HRdata purchasing datasecurity data Client Services dataand within each of every data domainmodel we have clearly defined where ourdata stored source of system system ofrecordhow are they presented so kind of systemof presentation and everything else runsin Google yeah so we are using GoogleLocker in Google bigquerywe have even our HR team so I take thisas aum how do I say as a sneak preview ourHR team is working with Google Locker solast year they have been working on SAPBW this year Ohr analytics team isworking on Uber locker and they like itbecause they can play around which theycouldn't do beforeso this is about data meshand the last one is about Ai and machinelearning so this is where we are stillin a I would say at a very early phasewe had just two weeks or three weeks agowe have done a group wide exercise toask people like which cases do you have100 plus cases collected in two weeks soeveryone wants to do AIand this is why I'm saying good at theKeynotes suggest that it goes in twominutes the reality looks a bitdifferentbut we have three cases that we arelooking at the first one is how can wedo Capital markets research so today wehave a lot of people who are reallydoing this manually ESG how do you findout ESG for many many companiesworldwide and can make out of this atleast transparent data very structuredsecond item I think should be veryfamiliar to most of you is how do youautomate certain customer services itticketing HR ticketing clientinteraction so these are things whereyou have a lot of questions that comerepetitively yeah so I can speak fromthe IT worldthe number of questions you can askabout my PC is broken is limited andthey are the same for every companyand the last one is document search alsoa very very I would say interestingthing especially for us as an industryso typically you get every month forexample a long list of newer documentsfrom Regulators commissions governmentsand so on where then someone is sittingand reading 80 Pages marking thingswriting emails around it now the readingdoesn't take five days it takes fivesecondsthese are things we are investigatingbut is that this is a bit more a sneakpreview and an Outlookso coming to the last Point Keytakeawaysso what are the three things I would sayI personally have learned in the lastthree years and I would alsolet's say pass on first one istechnology drives changeand it is not about having peoplediscuss tool a is better than tool B andTool B is better than tool C people lovetools but you can buy a lot of tools buta chain of tools doesn't help you youneed a strategic partner who really iskind of front running who has experienceand who can help you in bringingdifferent Technologies together yeah andthis is something where you really haveto change the patternthe second one is start today nottomorrowboth on the infrastructure side but alsoon the s4hana side as for Hana I meanyou have seen the Curvewhen we speak to Professional Servicestake Accenture TCS Deloitte whomever youwant to name if you ask them like heycan I start as for Hana project with youtomorrow they will tell you please comeback next year they don't have resourcesand typically you need to plan two tothree years right and if you dobackwards calculation 2027 minus threeyears you are in 2024. the same is onthe infrastructure side every day youdon't do this it's a lost day ofopportunity this is how I wouldtranslate it and I really mean itseriouslythe last one is again my favoriteregulation and Cloud Works theycomplement each other cloud has a lot ofbenefits for example when it comes toreporting like Risk reporting riskanalysis technology again can help youyeah andnobody can say to you that they are withwriting Excel sheets and Word Documentsthat they are faster than any machineand this is something what is veryimportant it however it requiresactively managing risk data processesthis is something we have to do wecannot avoid but as in that it iscomplementaryyeah so these are my three takeaways andwith this I would say very good then Iwould say thank you very much for theattention and for the rest of the daythank you"
