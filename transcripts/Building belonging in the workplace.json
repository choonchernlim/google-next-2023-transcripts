waited until 5:00 p.m. on aFriday to submit and it was not becauseof procrastination it was because I wasup with these Headliners at Cloud nextand I'm like who am I to come and speakand then it hit me I didn't know if Ibelonged and I'm not the only one whosometimes feels like I don't belong lackof belonging can come in all shapes andforms it could come in the form ofintimidation or impostor syndrome whatwhich is what I experienced for a smallbit of time before I decided to actuallyapply and put my name in the Hat and soif I can sometimes feel like I don'tbelong I know that others can sometimesfeel like they don't belong there was amoment in my career where I was reallyunhappy it was a summertime at aprevious company and it was internseason and I had been at the company forfive years I was in a managementposition and 5 to 10 people in that weekcame up to me and asked me if I was anintern I was surprised I've been therefor five years you all don't know that Iwork here and you don't know that I'm amanager at this company so I went to asenior leader and I said what am Isupposed to do with this and this seniorleader who was someone that I trustedtold me don't worry about that what Iwould do is go by a pair of glasses andchange the way that you dress and theway that you look you need to dress likeyou look older so then I went and boughtall this clothes that I was never goingto wear again to make myself look olderand then I really felt like I didn'tbelong I wanted to quit I dreaded comingto work every day and I looked at mywardrobe and honestly it was a bunch ofugly clothes that I would never wearagain and that was just to fit in and solast of belonging is such a criticaltopic because it impacts your workperformance like I said it comes inintimidation impostor syndrome but itlimits your psychological safety andyour Innovation and just quite franklyyour ability to be yourself at work andif it takes that much effort to show upat work every day that's a challenge forall of us and so let me start again myname is Dr Janine Lee I am a global headof Learning and Development at Googlefor the global businessorganization I have my Doctorate inEducation and I've spent the last coupleof years researching sense of belongingfor women of color in technology throughthose experiences where I didn't belongand those experiences where I did belongI took that I Amplified that and I tookthat to lead to the research that I'mabout to share with you today and sotoday my intent of being here is reallyto amplify my research to give you someBasics around belonging for you tounderstand what some of the contributorsare to belonging what some of thedetractors are and ultimately walk awaywith something tangible that you coulddo at your company to increase sense ofbelonging and I'm just going to say noneof this is rocket science they're reallyeasy Concepts you've probably heard themall before but what's going to make thebiggest difference is whether you'reactually going to act on ittoday so let's getstarted as I mentioned I had spent thelast several years researching sense ofbelonging in the workplace and this wasone of my favorite quotes from a womanof color participant and I'm just goingto take the time to read it to you sobelonging gives sense to my work lessstress feeling more psychologically safehence can contribute more without fearof making mistakes or being ostracizedit's not everything but it's close to itand so this is why belonging matters andthis is why it's important you didn'tsee the rest of the quote but she goeson to say actually it's the second mostimportant thing to me aside from megetting a paycheck um other than thatthat is the most important thing to mein theworkplace So today we're going to coverthree main topics I'm going to startwith explaining what is belonging as aConcept in comparison to diversityequity andinclusion what are the contributors andthe detractors that I saw in my researchand what are some of the recommendationsthat you can all walk away with today sowe're going to start with Ibelong we belong and together you allbelong and as we go into the firstsection we're going to talk a little bitabout what isbelonging so the academic definition ofbelonging is defined as the degree inwhich an individual actually feelspersonally accepted respected includedand supported in theworkplace and so when you think aboutthat what does this actually really meanso some of you may have heard about theparty as a concept first originated byverer Meyers who is a Dei expert and aVP in Netflix and she talks about whatit feels like going to a party as youhave all of these different concepts inplace so diversity is really around therepresentation at the party so do youhave representation and differences inthe age groups in the ethnicities in thegender in the sexuality and so forth ofthe people that are actually in the roomwhat does the representation look likethat's diversity when you think aboutEquity you think about whether everyonehas an equal chance to come to the partyso if you're charging a fee at the dooryou would have a sliding scale forpeople who make less versus those thatmake more or you might ask those thatmake less to bring nothing if you'rethinking about accessibility do you havestairs do you have an elevator caneverybody actually make it there and ifsomeone doesn't have a car is therepublic transportation that's close by sothat's Equity it's the chance to show upat the party with an equal chance aseverybody else that's invited and thenthere's inclusion is everyone includedare you all invited to the party andwhen you get there are you included todance has someone asked you to come tothe dance floor and last but not leastthere's belonging so you could have allof these things you could have diversityequity inclusion but you still might notfeel like youbelong why you might ask well what's thefood that's being served if you're avegetarian and it's all meat then youmight not feel like you belong what arethe conversations that are taking placeare they talking about movies and musicthat you have no ideaabout is it that you just feel isolatedbecause nobody in the room looks likeyou so belonging is actually whether youwant to stay at that party so you mighthave gotten there you might have walkedthrough the door but do you actuallywant to stay at that party and if youwant to stay at that party and you wantto feel like you belong both at theparty and at the workplace how can weensure that everyone wants to feel likethey belong at that party and in yourworkenvironment so did you know that westill have the highest attrition ratefor women in technology compared to anyotherindustry in theworld so what the statistics are tellingus is that we're still lacking thatpipeline for women in stem andspecifically for women in technology andyou could see some of the statisticshere um women of color only make up 10%of all stem professionals and that'seven lower for women of color in Tech wehave the highest turnover rate comparedto any other industry for stte soscience technology and Engineering at56% and they are twice as likely to quittheir tech jobs in comparison to men andif they leave they're more than likelyto neverreturn so what can we do about thisthese numbers don't lookgreat so let's talk about what theresearch shows so again my research wasspecifically about women of color intechnology I did a mixed method studywith a quantitative survey andinterviews for triangulation of data andI spoke to almost 200 women of color intechnology and today I'm going to sharewith you the results of thatstudy and overall hopefully this couldgive you some general areas to thinkabout when you're thinking aboutbelonging in theworkplace so first I asked women ofcolor and Technology how would you self-rank your current sent of belonging andas you can see it was all over the mapso we had people as low as zero and oneand as high as nine and10 so what does that mean exactly itmeans that we have some individuals whoare feeling really isolated and sad intheworkplace and want to leave theircompanies quite frankly but we also havepeople on the other side of the Spectrumwhich is really exciting and hopefulthat they're able to feel or a 10 intheir sense of belonging in their workenvironments so because of that varietyyou could see the standard deviation inthe variance is quite Broad and onaverage women of color and Technologyrated that they were at about a6.7 so is that good is that bad I meanthe last I checked 6.7 67% that's a d sowe're probably not doing great now youmight ask well how does 6.7 compare toeveryone else in the techindustry so I extrapolated some datafrom Employee Engagement surveys andhappiness questions amongst the top techcompanies and what I found was that onaverage everyone else in Tech was about1.3 pointshigher so they're at about eight ingeneral in sense of belonging score soagain there's a disparity in how womenof color and Tech are perceiving theirexperiences compared to the rest of theindividuals in the techindustry and so what does this mean itmeans that we can do better it meansthat there's still opportunities forgrowth and it it means that there'scompanies that are doing it reallyreally well so how do we get to thosenine and tens and how do we make surepeople aren't feeling like zeros andones in theworkplace so then the next step was tothink about what are your contributorsif you were to sum up all the thingsthat give you Joy at work and help youfeel like youbelong what would that be and so fromthis survey and meeting with women intheir interviews yep take your phonesout if you want to take pictures thenumber one factor was Pierce and what Ifound was that people just want humanconnection they want socialinteraction they want to feel includedthey want to beinvitedand the other thing is you all in thisroom arepeers any of you could reach out andmake that big of an impact on someonewho's feeling like they don't belong inthe workplace and that was just profoundto me it was even higher ranked thantheir manager in fact and that was whatwas most critical to them to feel likethey belonged uh more specifically inthis peer-based environment employeeresource groups were also very importantCommunity groups were very important andeven externalorganizations that had nothing to dowith their companies that they couldconnect with was really important forthem to feel like theybelonged and so you all again have anopportunity to make an impacthere now what were thedetractors so the highest rateddetractor was organizationculture now what does that mean culturecan mean different things to differentpeople go ahead take your phones out ifyou want to take somepictures organizational culture isreally what do you what do you say theorganization represents what are theirvalues how do people make keydecisions and within organizationalculture all of these women that I spoketo felt like their company was workingagainst themI had one woman share with me howexcited she was that at their companyAll Hands they were celebrating blackhistory month and she could see that themoment the CEO started speaking aboutBlack History Month the numbers startedto drop on the zoom call people startedleaving and over 50% of the companystopped listening and checked out andthat was a sign to her in her culturethat her company didn't care about deand I yes the CEO put it up on the boardand made it a big agenda item on the AllHands but everyone in the company didn'tcare to be there and listen and thatreally made her feel like she didn'tbelong organizational culture could alsobe about lack of representation a lot ofthe women that I spoke with felt likebecause they couldn't see themselves atthe company or in these higherleadership roles they didn't feel likethere was a career trajectory for themand so what does that mean exactly asyou're thinking about your culture welleveryone strives to have psychologicalsafety and they want to bring theirwhole selves to work again they don'twant to pretend to be someone else inorder to fit in and it can be prettyisolating like the story that I told youabout how I had to buy glasses to try tolook older atwork so why are westuck why can't we moveforward and how can we all agree to dobetterand work should be a place where you goto to provide for your loved ones butyou should feel that you have a sense ofpurpose and respect when you show up andso if it's important to you which all ofyou are here listening to this talkbecause you care about buildingbelonging in your workplace how can wemake this important for everyoneelse all right so on to our last sectionon We Belong we're going to talk abouttherecommendations on what can actuallymake a difference in theworkplace so I conducted a literaturereview on existing recommendations onincreasing sense of belonging and I alsointerviewed women and had women completerecommendations on what they would liketo see their CEOs do and their companiesdo and I'd sum it all up in an acronymPSA and this is a public serviceannouncement because this is what wecould be doing better to Foster thatsense of belonging in theworkplace P first stands for peer-basedsupport groups or peers in general inthe workplace so how many of you have abest friend at work if you're able raiseyourhand all right imagine if that bestfriend wasn't there tomorrow howdisappointing would that be who wouldyou have to Spill the tea with every daywho would you have to empathize with youwhen things aren't going right at workand who would you go to if you have asilly question but you're tooembarrassed to ask everybodyelse this is a pivotal opportunity foryou all to be that peer-based supportgroup to those in your companies thatcould be feelingisolated when someone's new and has justcome on board do you introduce yourselfand do you welcome them do you take thetime to answer their questions do youreach out and schedule lunch withsomeone that's sitting by themselves atwork every single daythis first step of PE peer based supportis something that each and every one ofyou could be doing today to Foster anincrease sense ofbelonging next s mentors and sponsors ifyou're able raise your hand if you haveamentor now keep that hand raised if youhave asponsorokay so what's the difference between amentor and a sponsor and for some of youwho have gone to boomies talk probablyheard a lot about mentorship earlierthismorning mentorship is really sharingthese words of wisdom so it's aboutknowledge and guidance and guidingsomebody towards their career goals buta sponsor is someone who is activelytaking action they're the ones sayingYour Name Behind Closed Doors whenyou're not even there in the roomthey're the ones seeking theseopportunities for your advancementthey're the ones advoc ating for you foryour performance review and your nextpromotion and research shows that wehave a lot of mentors in the workplacebut we need more sponsors so if you'rein a position of power if you're in theroom when people are being talked aboutdo you have that opportunity to advocatefor someone and so the second step isreally around sponsorship and mentorshipand any of you could be a mentor andmany of you can still be sponsors evenif you're not in a high position ofauthority to advocate forsomeone and the last step is reallyaccountability so none of this mattersif leaders do not take action and what Iheard number one from all theparticipants is that they want people towalk the talk so don't just tell mebelonging is important don't just tellme that you want this to be a place thatI can be happy working at but actuallydo something about it so what does thatmean it means that our leaders couldbetter educate themselves it means thatthey could be taking courses aroundallyship and fostering inclusiveleadership it means put their moneywhere their mouth is if you're sayingit's important is there a budget are yougiving me money and are you giving metime for my employee resource groups orto go to events and to feel like Iactuallybelong and are you acting on inequitieswhen you see them in the workplace ifpeople are being disrespectful forexample what I shared about the peoplewho were logging off as a CEO wastalking about Black History Month didthat CEO address that and tell theiremployees that's not okay this isequally as important as all of the otherupdates that I just gaveyou and lastly fostering that culture asa leader is so instrumental because thatwas the number one detractor that wejust talkedabout so I do want to applaud that manycompanies are already doing this todayit's just a matter of whether they'reactually following through and they'reactually takingaction and so how can you actuallyImplement all of thesethings this is the prosi Adar modelwhich is a model forChange and so it starts with awarenessis your company aware that thereactually is a problem have you looked atthe data both internally and externallyto show that people still don't feeltheybelong and after they have awareness isthere actually a desire is there aburning platform for them to actuallymake a change and why and what's in itforthem and next moving into knowledge ifyou have the awareness and desire tochange then what is it exactly thatyou're supposed to do who are the keydecision makers and how are theyinfluenced to actually make achange and fourth the ability piece nowthat you know what you're supposed to docan you actually do what you're supposedto do and whether you are in thatposition to influence or you're in thatposition to be a decision maker how doyou actually move forward and executewith your plan and secure budget andspace and executivesponsorship and lastly it's not aoneandone so you don't just Implementsomething you actually need it to bereinforced so how are you going tosustain belonging in your workplace howare you going to make sure that this isstill top and center and a priority foryour company and that might be havingbulletins All Hands meetings it could behaving events where people can gatherand get along it could be trackingmetrics but that last piece is soessential because you don't just changea culture overnight you have to sustainthe culture so these are some tangiblesteps that you could utilize as animplementation plan to change belongingin yourworkplaceso I started mystory by telling you all about a momentthat I didn'tbelong and you could see that thedifference is quite Stark and unsettlingso you'll see me happy belonged DrJanine Lee and you'll see me when Idon't belong where I feel isolated anddepressed and that's actually not aphoto of me it's a stock photo but youget what I'm saying I don't have any sadphotos of myself but it's such such abig difference when you're feeling likeyou belong in the workplace and then themoments where you feel like you don'tbelong what I realized that I needed inthe moments where I did belong was thePSA strategy I needed the peers whoreached out to me I've had incrediblebest friends at work um who've beenallies who've been someone that I cancount on when I'm feeling weak and themost memorable moment that I had waswhen my grandmother passed awayand my peers got together and when Icame back to work the first day they hada huge Banner that said we're here foryou Janine with a heart and flowerswaiting for me and that just meant somuch to me because they knew howimportant my grandmother was to me andthey knew how important it was for me tostep away from work and cover for me andso that peer-basednetwork is so critical and any of youcan be that peer-based support group thesecond thing is that I sought outsponsors and I sought outmentors not the one that was telling meto buy the glasses but new mentors andnew sponsors who told me that it wasokay to be myself and to look the waythat Ilooked and those sponsors spoke my namein the room when I wasn't there theyadvocated for my performance forpromotion for growth opportunities toput me on high visibilityprojects and then lastlyaccountability I've met so many amazingleaders who have actually takenaccountability forward have startededucating themselves have given money todo inclusive leadership workshops andhave continued to fight the inequitiesthat exist in the workplace and throughthose PSA steps I felt like I couldbelong and so even though I didn't knowif I was going to be here today at thebeginning of this conversation I realizethat I'm supposed to be here todaybecause I wanted to show up for allthose people that have showed up for meI wanted to show up for you all and evenif one person showed up and for those ofyou that are watching the recording Ihave more than one person in the roomokay it would still be all worth itbecause I wanted you all to hear aboutthe research and the ways that you couldreally spawn a change in yourorganizations for everybody tobelong so what's holding you back that'sthe question that I'm going to leave youwith we know that when when peoplebelong in theworkplace there's an increasedproductivity increased Innovation andcollaboration in fact research showsfrom great places to work that peopleare three times more likely to beexcited to come to work every day whentheybelong they're five times more likely tostay with your company and they're ninetimes as likely to feel like inequitiesdon't exist and that they're beingtreated fairly and withrespect so I challenge you all to thinkabout one thing in the PSA strategy onesmall change that you could make in yourworkplace whether you're a peer you're amanager or you're in a position of powerjust one thing and think about that fora moment what is it that you're going todo differently when you walk out of thissession that can Inspire others to dosomething different around belongingbecause you all have the power to dosomething different again you saw numberone was peer-based support groups andhow that contributes to sense ofbelonging so together let's create aworld where everyone feels like theybelong together thank[Applause]you"
