run one of thesoftware businesses which is aroundNetwork management and monitoring soanything to deal with networkinfrastructure software-defined networksCloud networks internet networksmonitoring them testing them validatingthemumand I'll introduce Mike Hustler herefrom the team hi I'm Mike Hustler I headengineering for the app Neta productteam which is part of the the net opSuite of products uh at broadcom I'vebeen in um network monitoring Networkmanagement for basically my whole wholecareerum looking at things like activemonitoring of synthetic monitoring ofapplications and and networks passivemonitoring like deep deep packinspection and netflow Analysisbut uh we're here talking to uhpeople who are putting applications inGoogle Cloud putting applications in thecloud so don'thead for the door because when I thinkabout network monitoringI think about the application and thereason that the network is there throughall of our the software that we build isis it's about the application it's abouttaking the user and connecting them withthe application and and that's thereason that the network exists so that'salways the Forefront of of my mind yeahnot only does Mike know networks but hebuilds uh SAS products in Google Cloudso we have a lot of experience and andwhat it takes to make those workum and I want to thank Google you knowfor letting the network nerds out of thebasement come here to talk in the InThis Cloud environment because I thinkif you're involved in moving things tothe cloud or building things in thecloud you may become more and more awareof uh the impact of the network on thesuccess of that so that's why we're hereto talk about thisuma little bit of agendabut we'll get right to it so I will talka little bit abouthow cloud is impacting Networks my firstjob 20 plus years ago was actuallyimplementing HP network node manager ifanybody remembers back in the day when anetwork was like a bunch of devices on ascreen with with a line between them andyou kind of just were trying to see ifthe infrastructure was up or down and itwas a simple worldand it's been changing quite a bitum you know we moved into softwaredefined networks maybe you know 10 yearsago that started happening which wasactually really there to help us get tothe Cloud and that added immensecomplexity to running networks now wehave customers even huge customers whoare internet first Cloud first they'vethey've moved Way Beyond things in theircontrol and it's creating you know a lotof complexity and challengesI've seen this stat for many years nowthat it was always you know next yearwas the year of the cloud but it reallyfrom you know this is now real the cloudoperating modelexists and even customers where it waspretty unlikely that we thought they'dbe embracing it you know large regulatedentities who have justmoved in to the whole thing and asthey've done ittheir success has very much to do withhow they've thought about the networkand how people will connect to thoseworkloads in the cloudand uh our most successful customershave actually taken really a networkfirst mentality as they've designedtheir workloads and as they've managedtheir migrations and so what we kind ofwanted to do was share what very maturecustomers are doing the way they'reapproaching itum you know and finding successand it really starts with I guess aperspective that I'll give Mike a chanceto talk about yeah so uh endinvisibility is what uh uh what we'retrying to give users and and uh from thefrom the user to the app as I've said sowhen the application was in the datacenter and the user was was in theoffice uh your your network path wentfrom from there to the to the datacenter and that was your area of concernas the application moved oh the datacenter into the cloud the network pathchanged but the other concern beingyou're still just as concerned aboutdelivering the application to the userno matter where they are same thing whenthe user moved out of the office toco-working space or work from home theystill needed the same access to theircritical apps and uh that that concernis is still there although the networkthe network is changing so that thechallenge withum end-to-end visibility is the dynamicnature of of these endpoints and beingable to keep keep up with that but alsoa large part of this network is outsideof uh your control outside of your yourown it teams infrastructure and that'swhere active monitoring really plays a arole to give you that end-to-end uhvisibility so Dynamic we've talked aboutthat the both endpoints are are movingyou've got Cloud transformation uhyou've got uh and your end users thatare moving from the office to to workfrom home you've got complexities asMike said whether it's sd-wan softwaredefined networks uh are they going on uhthrough through the application viatunnel or they have a split tunnel athome there's a ton of a ton ofcomplexities that you're you're tryingto manage and as as I've said the uhlargemore and more of the network is outsideof outside of your actual infrastructureoutside of outside of your control buttheumthe the visibility and the area concernis is still thereyeah so I mean when we when we'reworking with various customers todaywe're getting into a a conversationaround how they're going to manage theirnetworks you end up witha room full of cloud folks Network folkssecurity folks Architects automationpeople event management people I was ata large bank and it took 22 people toget in the room to actually figure outhow they were going to get a moreresilient performant connection to a acritical application they'd move to thecloudnow that Network Services team is stillon the hook the operations team is onthe hook and in many cases they weren'tever invited into the designprocess we say moving it to the cloudcool and now you have app developersmaking Network decisions you have sresmaking Network decisions you've gotsecurity people making Network decisionsbut at the end of the daythe Network Services team the operationsteam is getting hammered with supportcalls the the Google team their supportteam getting calls I can't connect to myworkload in the cloud nothing wrong withmy networkand so we end up in this situation nowwhere everybody shares some level ofaccountability in delivering thisconnected experience but the awarenessof how to approach it is is notpervasive yet right so what we wanted todo was kind of lay out first of all likea mindset that should be can be sharedacross all those stakeholders that I wastalking about and then ways to actuallybring people together around theappropriate data and perspective so I'llgive it to Mike on thatso let's illustrate the uh the theum kind of break it up into somewhatarbitrary about four four areas ofconcern you got the the end user domainthat could beum your your large campus with a rocksolid landum Wi-Fi in every corner on on everyfloor IT personnel on on hand to uh tohelp uh Monitor and make sure thateverything everything is solidum it could be a small remote office uhwithout it uh people on handum and it could be it could be work fromwork from home as wellum you've got ISP it could be aum uh redundant uh commercial grade uhservice provider or it could be aasymmetric uh borderline residential uhgrade uh grade service provider and thebackbone which is obviously out of uhoften out of sight out of mind but butthat still plays into your end userexperience is there traffic congestionare you slow to have uh bgp convergenceare there routing issues that areaffecting your uh your end userexperience and is that something thatyou could be talking to your ISP aboutand and the backbone that they're thatthey're connected connected to of coursewe're at at Google so Google's got apristine Network there'll never be anynetwork issues uh in in Google Cloud buthypothetically speaking what if therewas you'd like to have visibility intothat and uh and understand kind of whatthat what that issue is and is theresomething that that you can you can doabout itum so you've got a dynamic problem spaceyou need to basically accept itum and uh Define your visibilityum into that Network into your overallapplication observability modelumwhen I think about building thatobservability model I think of a coupleof customer use cases so one is arelatively large insurance insurancecompany with um hundreds of very smalloffices across the countrythese offices uh have no I.T Personnelin themum through it they manage that through amanaged service provider who has limitedaccess to the to the site butthe back end software systems arerunning in in the cloud and it'scritical that the uh that that networkis not degrading the end user experiencethe end user experience is felt by thatthat uh agent's customersanother example when you go to checkinto your hotel and I'm sure you'veheard the uh the the agents say I'mhaving trouble with my computer mycomputer is slow that slowness hasnothing to do with the computer that'sright there it's all about the networkthat's connecting to the reservationsystem that's running that's running inthe cloud and when you think of that umour customers that are that are usingthat they're building in that thatvisibility into the network from all ofthose hotels to the data center that'srunning the reservation system andthat's just part of their that's part oftheir application observability modelright from the right from the get-goso you've you've got this uh you've gotthis commitment to build yourobservability model to include networksnow what data do you need of course youneed lost latency and Jitter that's yourtable Stakes for uh for uh Networkperformanceumbut but you're you're not able to pullthat in necessarily in traditionaltraditional means because you don't ownyou don't know the network you can'tconnect to all of the network devicesand use API or SNMP to to pull that databackyou've got you've got uhumactive monitoring through the networkfrom the user to the application tomeasure the network performance acrossall the Hops and uh you're looking atthat continuously so you're you'rebuilding that umyou building that data set up over overtimeand you're able to identify exactlywhere the uh issue is is happeningum and this is uhthis is whatthat this is the the key part aboutactive monitoring that gets gets getsexcited is defining the where and beingable to Define define the whereumso consider uhapplication performance issue that'sthat's uh that's resonated someone comesin the morning they've got ticketsagainst it they they've got all the datais is coming in they're able to scopethis uh scope the um scope the data downbecause they'veum say it's packet loss packet loss iscausing uh it's causing flueness in thein the application or or uh poorperformance in in access to theapplication they look back in timebecause they've got continuousmonitoring and they're able to see thatactually packet loss started at uh 3 15in the morningand they're able to uh to dig in on theuh whoops sorrythey're able to uh unpack on exactlywhat routes were in playum during that during that event at 3 50in the morning and and they're able togo to say identify thatNot only was packing loss happening inDan we actually found that it beganbegins at Hop three so they're able togo to say their ISP or perhaps to theirum uh to their uh it team and say thisis this is where it's beginning and theylook and they see that there's a networkchange event that that put a config downto a router and that that caused thecause the eventso we just walked through aa troubleshooting use case where therewas an issue and then they looked backover time and able to hunt down and findthe find the root cause of that issuebut just like in your application stackyou're monitoring all your VMS and if aVM goes down you're notified immediatelyor you're monitoring your gke loadand are you notified of any issues uhimmediately in the same way you need tohave uh visibility into your network andidentify network issues immediately sothat you're not in the in atroubleshootingum troubleshooting scenario a break fixscenario there's no reason why you can'thave that when you've got the datacoming in continuouslyactually head back to that for a secondif you don't mindso from a business perspective right ifyou're running let's say NetworkServices or you know a larger operationand you've transitioned most of yourstuff to the cloud you've outsourcedmaybe you're you're running operativeyour networks so you end up in aposition where you're actually nowmanaging a supply chain of connectivityinstead of running and operating yournetwork and I see it in big big entitiesyou know and and very important parts ofour economy have made this moveso it changes now where what I'm reallytrying to do is manage the supply chainof connectivity understand who'sperforming who's not performing I'mgoing to do a cloud migration or let'ssay even before I get there I'm going tolay out a sassy sd-wan infrastructure Ineed to know how all those isps areperforming I need to kind of Baselinewhere I'm at today with the WAN I have Ineed to start to get into that ProActiveManagement mindset becausewhat I've seen with a lot of the cloudmigrations is that was an afterthoughtwe moved it it's great Cloud providedall these benefits scale and and the appis awesome but we did you know we didn'thave the data didn't have the disciplinearound testing and the network itselfand holding accountable that's thatsupply chain of uh connectivityproviders so that's where you know Mikeshared the troubleshooting part this isabout really getting proactive andthere's a you know we've seen this witha couple customers who have actuallyreally made this leap and they have thisdiscipline you can go to the next slidewhere the whole team the cloud teamsecurity Team Network team everybody hada shared mindset around the network isgoing to be critical to this migrationthey did a lot of effort and theyactually do this every time they moveapplications to the cloud or buildapplications to the cloud to Baselinethe connectivity to test throughout toadd active testing of networkconnections throughout the migrationprocessto then get to the final state wherethey're actually really measuring theconnected experience as a key kpi of thecloud migration and they've baked inthis kind of monitoring into theirprocess and that's enabled them toreduce a lot of risk and now get intothis Cloud operating model where theyfeel very confident about what they'redoingum so that's uh that's what we wanted toshare with you guysforeign"
