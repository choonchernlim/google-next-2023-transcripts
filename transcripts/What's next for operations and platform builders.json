shapesthe evolution of our products andservicesfrom the early days of app enginethrough the invention of kubernetes andGoogle kubernetes engineand learnings leading to cladron andGoogle distributed cloudcustomers have always been at the centerof everything we doin our journey we learned it's neverabout one specific feature or anotherinstead we engage with empathyunderstanding the expectationschallenges and most importantly whatsuccess looks like for youand we are living in exciting timewhat's possible is rapidly changing andthe role we all play in our businesssuccess Risesthis is true whether you are working ina small company or large in retailbanking or gaminganywhere in the world which means theexpectations from all of us changewe are expected to deliver on speedskill and securitywe need to provision infrastructureinstantly a deploy application fasterensure compliance across the softwarelife cycleultimately leading to faster Innovationcycle and Engineering productivitycloud has become the destination for allorganizations to remain innovativeand we are all expected to do more withless rightthe reality is that there is anunprecedented demand to use the cloudfor all kinds of workloadstoday let me tell you what we've beenworking on to be the best partner foryouwhether you build AI applications andcreate new experiences or enhanceexisting Enterprise capabilities we aimto meet your requirements today andoffer flexibility for the futurestarting with AI we are at a pivotalmoment in our journey where AI candeliver tangible value in every industryGoogle's AI acceleration platform canhelp you in this journeyit is open and accessible across alllayersmeets diverse customer needs and offersthe widest choice of purpose-built AIHardwareit is designed to meet the needs ofevery AI workload and every customertype from foundational model Builders totuners to Consumersby the way many customers are alreadyusing gke for their AI workloads likeEquifax Spotify and moleculetypically there are three core featuresof kubernetes that make it well suitedfor AI workloadsusing open and standard API inkubernetes we can smoothly Portworkloads between laptopData Center and Cloudthis portability is very important forthe IML and HPC communitiesit enables you to reliably reproduceresultskubernetes also scaled from a singleworkstation to thousands of nodesgke can scale to 15 000 nodes itsupports gpus Auto provisioning autoscaling making it super easy to scale upand down training and serving workloadsyou can focus on model building andtraining without having to worry aboutunderlying infrastructure andcompatibility issuesyou can increase productivity by freeingup users from managing their ownworkstations servers and VMS withkubernetesas you heard from Thomas yesterday weare excited to announce support for TPUon gkesupport for cloud TPU V4 is generallyavailable and v5e is now in previewthis enables all of you who use ourindustry-leading ppus to benefit fromthe gkey capabilities you are familiarwith and lovegenerative AIis not only transforming softwaredevelopment but also it operations asevident from industry researchgen AI Solutions like duetai shortensthe distance between brainstorming andexecution getting you closer to the endgoaland here is a demo of how to add Ai andgke come together to help make platformBuilders and operations teams moreproductivewhat you can see here is how duetai andso specific questions and assist withcreating a gke cluster by providing youthe necessary terraform ScriptsI love how intuitive and helpful it isand I can't wait for all of you to tryit outtogether with AI workloads modernworkloads can deliver Superior customerexperience for your customers and it'sall about containers and serverlessevery organization is using containersit is expected that by 2027 more thanthat 90 percent of organizations will berunning containers applications inproductionthis is a significant increase fromfewer than 40 in 2021we are in the post VM era containers arethe present and the futureand over the past 20 years we innovatedleading to our Google Cloud products andbest practicesstarting in 2003 with Borg which is ourinternal container orchestration systemthe inspiration to kubernetes to todaywith products like cloudron and gkehere is a quick video showing some ofthe reasons why customers choose GoogleCloud managed container platformsCloud runfully managedcontainers abstracting away allinfrastructure management whether youown event-driven long-running servicesor deploying containerized jobs toprocess data Cloud run automaticallyscales your containers up and down fromxero this means you only pay when yourcode is running you can write code usingyour favorite language framework andlibraries package this up as a containerrun gcloud run deploy and your app willbe live provided with everything itneeds to run in production and if youever need to run outside of cloud runSide Run workplace are portable thanksto cloudrun using an API compatible withkubernetesso the next time you're wondering whereto run your containerized workload keepCloud run in mindkubernetes has gained immense popularityfor its ability to enable businesses torun and manage apps at scale and gke isthe most scalable and fully automatedkubernetes service using gke meanshaving Google Engineers take care ofimplementing all of the recommendedpractices for kubernetes so yourdevelopers can focus on building theapplication that run on top ofkubernetesautopilot but default and recommendedway to run containers from gke takesthis further than any prior kubernetesofferingwe can help customers achieve a promiseof true workload portability betweenserverless or kubernetes runtimes publicprivate or Edge Cloud providers andlocations without compromisingconsistency security or velocityas you saw Google Cloud can deliverSimplicity and automation through Cloudrun leading industry-leading serverlesssolution and gke the most scalable andautomated serviceand unlike the competition we have madesignificant Investments to make it easyto use both Cloud run and GK why tochoose we don't want to force youchoosing one or anotherwe designed Cloud run to make runningcontainers in the cloud as simple and asfast as possiblethere is no infrastructure to manage nocompute cluster management orconnectivity management requiredand it allows you to go fast a developeris able to deploy a cloudronmicroservice in secondsyou just need to bring your containersand we handle the rest including scalingto zerofor example around the time of theannouncement of the Queen's passing inSeptember 2022BBC saw some huge traffic spikesduring the largest Spike within oneminute they went from running 150 to 200container instances to over one thousandand the infrastructure just workedimagine how it is to look at your screenand just see everything work without youneeding to lift the fingerand there's a great example of this isrecently launch support for sidecars inCloud runsidecars can make it much easier tointegrate Cloud run Services into yourexisting cloud service ecosystemwhether you use a third-party loggingand monitoring service or networkproxies for advanced networkingfunctionalityyou can now integrate your Cloud runservice with this third-party extensionsimply by deploying a sidecar containerthis makes your developer more efficientand your Cloud deployments easier tooperatecustomers such as NASDAQ and Etsy arealready ripping these benefits bybringing in their Envoy open Telemetryand manageable methods integration toeasily extend cloudron's nativeenvironmentsit's been amazing to witness whatcustomers like kerafor have built withgkey and Cloud runmany have simplified their architectureimproved operational efficiency andlower the total cost of ownershipto expand the impact of containersrelaunch anthos in 2019as a platform to manage gke

oneplacewell I think that by now you probablyare tired of hearing from meand it's my pleasure to invite some ofyour peers in the industry who havepartnered with us to elevate theiroperation to the stage so welcomewelcome basil Omer Laura and Cameronthank you thank you so much lookingforward for this conversationuh so Laura you've been on a journey ofmodernization a big shift in Arvest Bankfor the last two years when you reflectback what have been fundamental for thesuccess of this project yeah thank youum there's been two really keycomponents to success the first keycomponent would really be having abusiness strategy and then making sureyou tie that road map and even yourmigration plan to that business strategyyou want to know where you're going soeverybody knows the direction it alsohelps set priorities which is a reallyimportant component of it I would saythe second piece of it is reallyactually upskilling and reskilling sobringing everybody along for the ridehow do you get everybody on the bus andmaking sure they're comfortable with itright during this transformation there'sa lot of fun right fear and certaintyand doubt and so you have to make surethat you you kind of everybody needs tofeel like they're part of what's goingon and so what we did was create aprogram called me and Arvest and thatprogram really was about defining ropeprofiles learning Journeys and makingeverybody feel like they knew what theirpath was as part of our transformationoh this is awesome thank you and betteryou know I've been talking about theimportance of of time to market forexample what do you feel is critical foruploving Journey and what is the role ofGoogle Cloudfirst thank you very much for allowingto share a little bit from what aboutwhat we learned through the app lovingJourney come from I'm incredibly proudto be a part ofum at uploading we have astraightforward yet ambitious mission toconnect businesses big and small tocustomers all over the world we do itthrough software and AI techniques thatallow our clients to grow reach andmonetize their audiencesthe tech industry has often beencompared to the survival of the fittestand I'm very proud to say that in thelast 11 years app loving hasn't justsurvived it has thrived in that industryI think our secret sauce is a culture ofinnovation this culture allowed us torespond to the changes in our customersdemands changing changes in ecosystemsand most importantly constant change intechnological advancements that weobservedI think partnering with Google has beena game-changing partnership for us theexperimentation ecosystem and theFrameworks that Google has providedallowed us to nurture the culture ofinnovation in two major waysfirst we were able to run a plethora ofexperiments much much faster timebetween an idea a test and furtherrefinement or going to other ideas hasreduced significantlythe second point was how flexible theplatform is I really believe that it isa very dangerous thing to be bound bythe infrastructure rigidity that mayimpose limitations on the algorithms onthe math on the ideas that you want totry working with Google Cloud allowed usnot to think about the infrastructurallimitations but instead to focus onideas and their implementations as theywere conceived to sum up I think Googlewas a force multiplier in creating ourculture of innovationthe tech industry will keep evolvingand I strongly believe that with thehelp of Google Cloud engine app lovingwill be able to remain on the Forefrontof that evolutionthank you and this is actually a greatsegue to come around because snap havebeen a long time Google Cloud customersand I think it's fair to say that youknow Google cloud and snap grew togetherin some sense so maybe come on can youtell a little bit how we co-innovatedand push the boundariesthat's a great question thanks forhaving meum you know Snapchat is started on appengineum when I joined a snap nine years agothe first thing that got my attentionwas how is this possible that it's sucha very very a small team we were able tolike handle such a huge traffic andserving tens of millions of users andthen there was like this joke that youwould say internally that it's true thatour team is very small but we have anarmy of sres and Google Engineers thatare helping us to scale the app as asnap grew and our organization grew andwe wanted to basically bettercustomization of our workloads and beable to have like better failureisolation we went through this journeythat many companies go through which islike basically breaking up the monolithinto service oriented architecture so weheavily embraced gke andkubernetes-based Technologies and Googlewas a great partner to help us tomigrate from App engine to uh gkeplatformum and I can say like Google played aninstrumental role basically helping usgo from like two Engineers working onthe infrastructure to now like havinglike an engineering size of like 2 000peopleyeah that's definitely uh soundsfamiliar but it was amazing like havingthat JourneyandOmar better was mentioning theimportance of flexibility of theplatform and Innovation can you maybe goa little bit more to details of howusing gke has been valuable foruploading yeah of course thank you aheadumApple even started off in really atraditional way we had data centers uhbare metal service providers and our youknow our business was continuing to growhowever it felt like our infrastructurewas coasting a bit and so we made thatdecision in late 2020 to migrate toGoogle Cloudwe did that in three months it was a funjourney andit ended up being a immediate impact forour businessfrom there our AI advertising engine wascontinued to be built up on and thisyear we decidedum that we needed to do something new weneeded something to be flexible andscalableand for us that ended up being gke andwith the power of using gke with gpusuh we were able to scale froma few instances in one region as anexperiment to worldwide productionrollout in really just a few weeksthis was really phenomenal and you knowto boss's point of you know you don'twant to be limited by the tools youreally want to accelerate and grow thebusiness and we really felt that waywith the power of Google Cloudumultimately you know we've you knowleveraged other tools as well likeserverless compute andum for us it's it's been an amazingexperience andI would say at least for me personallylike at life changing yeahit's great I mean I wasn't sure ifyou're being cynical it was no attorneyor not butthat's definitely good yeah you knowwhat but with all this scale I think youknow one thing that I often hear fromour customers ishow do you optimize cost per performancelike does how do you reason about it inthe trade-offs Cameron maybe you cantell us a little bit of snaps guidingprinciples with how you approach thatexcellent question you know like anycompany that goes through explosivegrowth managing cost of operations islike one of the huge problems that youwant to make sure that things remainwithin reasonum we are very regimented about it andwe think about the unit of value that weprovide to our customersum so we we innovated on this idea oflike scaling metrics for costs andbasically we measure the infrastructurecosts in terms of the unit of value thatwe provide like for example what is thecost of a thousand snaps that you sendwhat is the cost of like a thousandchats that we send and then we monitorthis and we try to figure out a reasonabout like the fluctuations on how wecan actually improve it in that lens sothere's a bunch of tools that we usedlike for example gcp profiling is one ofthe key products that we use also thethe cloud Ops tooling that gcp providesthere's a lot of fantastic Solutionsthere the gcp pricerecommendations for like cost savings isanother fantastic solutions that we useto basically Monitor and improve thingscontinuouslyyes and you're mentioning uh you knowthe recommendation so I think not manypeople know but they're actually withinGoogle cloud of course we've been uhleveraging AI for a long time of courselike for example with thoserecommendations that are availablebut I think you know you're introducinghere like an important point about theuh the value right that each action hasbecause I want to think that wewe also hear something with customerslike how do you justify modernizationlike taking a monolith right andbringing it to microservices is it's notan easy taskuh Laura I really like to know youshared with me how you guys are thinkingabout how you measure success maybe youcan share with us that yeah absolutelyum so it's it's similar to some degreeum and so part of what we try to do isthink about from a metrics perspectiveyou know everyone you might look at itfrom cost because we care about cost andso we partnered with our finance team tolook at it in two ways pureinfrastructure and uh savings and we'llsay related costs from moving from adata center to to cloud and so we tookthat and said you know normal you've gotHardware you've got Cloud compute you'vegotsoftware and software and where can wehave savings from things that we didn'tneed anymore because it was built intothe cloud that's one layer but then wetook the next layer which was reallystandard around one of the things thatwe're delivering that's valued to thebusiness so we built AI models around uhfraud and fraud prevention and so wetake that and say well how much willthat impact the business over whatperiod of time and so we look at it fromthat perspective so the layer of the waythat we did metrics was twofold so itwas just core infrastructure layer andthen business value and so we have fouror five right now ai use cases that areactually driving how we're measuring thevalue back to the business so it's fraudcontact center and a couple of othersbutI think that's really interestingbecause you know sometimes people thinkthat you know there's those digitalnatives like Snap and they have to totackle everything and have different setof problems like and here in this panelwe actually see that there are so manythings that are actually more similarand then one would think both with theplanning and the challenging and thechallenges and also how we measure costin valueum so I think we have like time for onemore question about the the theme ofGoogle next is athe new way to Cloud so what is likesomething that maybe you're excitedabout into the future thank you yeah asI look at all the announcements thatGoogle has made as I look at theprojects and the tools around uh youknow the conference and generally as Ilook at the new research specifically ingen AI field in generalI think we came to a very rareinflection point where algorithms meetscalable infrastructure meet amazingtooling and I believe that thisinflection point will lead to explosionof new ideas increased performance andhopefully will improve Human Conditionhopefully I agree with that and thankyou so much for joining really enjoyedthe conversation and really a big thankyou for the partnership I think you knowlike I've started in the beginning uhwithin Google Cloud customer empathy andworking with all our customers reallyshapes our products and services and wewould love you know the same way we workwith uhwith them is to of course to work withall of yousoto to wrap up we really would like toencourage all of you to start andexplore Cloud operations Cloud run andgkestart using the latest and greatestwe believe the few the future is nowpossibilities are endless for Innovationfor your operations and with containersand AI thank you so much for joining usforeign"
