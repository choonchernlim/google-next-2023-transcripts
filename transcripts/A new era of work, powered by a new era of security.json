Sassy at palotanetworks anybody here familiar with theterm sassy or secure access service edgewe're at a cloud conference here todayso this is a cloud delivered capabilityright butum this is really about access right andI'm going to explain what this means invery simple terms because I saw mosthands not go up but since we're at acloud conference I want to make surethis is CL that it's clear to all of youI'm not talking about securing Cloudworkloads containers and and code rightCI CD Pipeline and things like that I'mtalking about securing the accessbetween users and to wherever they'regoing whether that happens to be a cloudor some other internet resource or thedata center so just want to make sureeverybody was level set on what we'regoing to talk about today it stillshould be exciting there are noprerequisites or requisite knowledge tobe able to absorb what I'm going to tellyou I'm a dummy I keep things supersimple because that's how I like peopleto talk to me let's go ahead and getstartedum to ground the conversation I wouldjust like to saythat if we think about what the pandemicdid to us a few years ago but even goingback 10 12 years ago with mobility andthings like cloud and SAS adoptionit became very clear that work is anactivity it's not a placeand when we use that as a groundingstatement right when you think about howwe need to make technology decisionsmoving forward it makes it easier andclearer to just assumethe guardrails that we had in placecertain assumptions for when usersaccessed resources are no longer therethink about when we badge into an officeauthenticate to a network before we eventry to access a resource on that Networkthere are guard rails right toll gatesto get us therewhen everybody's sent home or people aretraveling on the road a lot of those goaway they just don't exist so how do wekeep a level security posture policy andreach regardless of where a user worksthat's what sansky's really meant tosolve at the end of the daywe need to look at things when when wetalk about you know okay if if workersaren't always going to be in an officedata is not always contained within aperimeterwe need to look at risk two ways when itcomes to access right one is what allcyber security companies should be doingblocking threats simple enough if we'renot doing that we're in the wrongbusiness right but the other elementthat most other organizations that tryto deploy is successful sassy Miss isthe operational element right businessresiliencyit was one thing when things like proxyServices started moving to the cloud toreplace an on-prem set of proxy serversrightnow we're sending Mission criticaltraffic through the secure accessservice edgesfrom users no matter where they work tothese applicationswith critical traffic going through itbusiness resiliency is required forthese Services now so we have to take aharder look at how we do that and thisis going to become very clear why thingsare a little bit better when we dothings with Googleso let's go ahead and look at this as Isaid in a simple wayumas I open this up we used to we used todo things in a certain waywe used to make sure we had certaincapabilities before our users accessedanythingthat eroded significantly 10 12 yearsago with the onset of cloud Mobility thepandemic just ushered that in rightfurther it eroded that completely towhere we had to assume there were noassumptions right so it changed the waywe thought about things it also createdchallenges that we're dealing with todaythings like fragments and securityposture when we have different tools allover the place now because users aregoing through one Tech stack whenthey're on-prem accessing on netresources going through a different Techstack when they're at home accessingdifferent resources we fragment whatwe're trying to keep secure andobviously fragmentation is difficult tomanage and controlthings like inconsistent user experienceright hey when I'm at home actuallyaccess to these SAS applications isgreat I go into the office and it'sterrible or vice versa with privateapplications when I'm in the office manthese certain applications work great Igo home they're really slow I can't workit's a productivity issue so userexperience let's just remember thisisn't about unhappy users calling thehelp desk and creating tickets it'stheir inability to workand we need our employees to work that'show we stay productive as anorganization right and then of coursepolicy management and complexity we needto keep things simple the more we haveto manage the more gaps can occur themore things can go wrong so we need toget better about this and take a betterapproach so why don't we look atsomething that delivers outcomes in amore simplified waywhat we're solving for at the businesslevel pretty simple right I'm not goingto read all these to you but theseshould be objectives familiar toeverybodyyou know what are we trying to look atwe're trying to make sure hybrid workershave a secure way of accessing theirresources we when we have heavy M Aactivity going on can we lessen the timeto value of that acquisition right howdo we make sure that our businessoutcomes are being achieved when itcomes to accessand I'll explain this simply laterthere's a three layer under or a threepronged underpinning to all of thisthough well we have to make sure we'redoing ensuring we've got visibility andcontrolso we've got this access you'll be ableto see it and control we can't managewhat we don't see can't control we don'tmanage right so it starts with that weneed to make sure that no what no matterwhat we do user experience is improvednot reducedand then of course we want to make surewe're trying to simplify our environmenttoo many tools to manage are typicallywhy we're here right something likeCloud resources makes things easy tomanage as we all know may not may notalways be the cheapest option for whatwe're trying to do but it increasesagility because things are simpler to dothey're faster to do right no differentin the cyber security space it's theexact same conceptthe idea of a secure access service edgemoves us forward why because it's asimplified approach to accesslet's look at this simply you got usersresources they need to accessdoesn't matter where these users arewhether they're home traveling or in abranch okay they need to access theseresources like I said earlier no matterwhere they live whether it's in the datacenter Cloud VPC colos SAS or web rightso you've got these two things that weneed to get togetherall sassy is meant to do or secureaccess service edge is connect thesethings as securely and efficiently aspossible with the ability to manage thatuser experience that's itso let's keep it simple for right nowright the idea access from any user toany resource securely efficiently andbeing able to view that trafficnow why is that important because thepromise of sassy when Gartner introducedthe market and the industry in August of2019 was to converge networking andsecurity to deliver better outcomes aunified platform solution that gives usaccess to both private applicationsand public applications in a unified waythe challenge that we've found here atpalota networks is that not all of thesassy vendors out there are living up tothat heightright the promise of sassy is kind offalling down a little bit so let's lookat the tool set typical environmentright this you this may look familiar toa lot of you same same idea users needaccess data center and Cloud resourcesthey're doing it over a VPN today theywant to access Internet Resourcesthey're doing over proxy SAS resourcesover at casby right what what we see noware certain vendors saying well we canreplace your VPN with a ztna solutioneasy enough okay and then we can replaceyour on-prem proxy and your casby with amore unified approach from the cloudokay it's still two products at the endof the day still two architecturesand then what are you doing about thebrancha lot of organizations are saying Idon't know if sd-wan's really a thingfor me I'm telling you right now it'spicking back up because of the hybridWorkforce people going back into theoffice those offices were largely letalone but is there a way to get moreoptimal with what we're doing there bothfrom a traffic routing perspective and acost perspective getting rid of privateline connectivity in favor of somethingmore Dynamic and internet and Cloudfriendly rightso this environment now today that a lotof a lot of our competitors push rightis still not necessarily solving theproblem of fragmentation multiplesecurity policies Access Controlpolicies things like that so it's goodmight be better than where a lot of ourorganizations are todaybut we think it could be better stillI'll just go ahead and answerso the idea here then is to take thatwhole same idea and unify the approachOne Cloud delivered capability thatsolves a problem of ztna it solves aproblem with a secure web or internetgateway solves a problem of your Cosbyfirewall as a service and integratedsd-wan one capability supplying thoseusers no matter where they are toresources no matter where they liveshould be pretty straightforward fromherenow we think abouthow AI can help this right this isprobably the most popular acronym overthe last seven months for good and badreasons right I think chat GPT opened alot of our eyes to what AI can do but italso opened our eyes to where it has itsflawswhat when when it was first introducedand it's index its knowledge index wentup to September 2021 and you asked it aquestion it didn't know what did it dosay I'm sorry I don't knowthis is too new for me no it lied to youit still does if it doesn't know theanswer but it's challenging you to tryto get smarter that's what AI does sowhen it comes to how AI can powersomething like a secure access serviceedge it's all about the data good dataproduces good outcomes and results soit's making sure that that date iscompleteconsistent and correctright and how do we do that when wethink about access tools and how doesthat actually help us from a securityperspective a networking perspectivebecause sassy is a convergence ofnetworking and security but thenoperations on day two once this isdeployed can we actually use a lot ofthese tools for good you've heard a lotabout AI so far in the last day and ahalf I'm sure and it is we're talkingabout using it for good but alsoprotecting our organizations from fromwhen it can be used for harmtoday I'm talking about it for where itcould be good for us in ourorganizationsso we want to make sure that we'retaking let's start with the securityside right we want to make sure we'retaking a more secure approach to zerotrust network access because it'simportant you'll hear This Acronym ztnaright zero trust network access anotherit's actually another Market that arecreated right before sassy the wholeidea is removing implicit trust the userhere means that access to that resourcethere's no implicit trust between thetwo all right so we're removing that andwe're granting access via policy howeverwhat are those policies based onidentity right so you have credentialsyou log in you authorize you getauthorized based on who you are thedevice you're coming from and then yourentitlements are granted based on thosevariables right the challenge that weseea lot of these Solutions is what happensthen when identity is the attack vectorlet's think about you know I came camefrom the legendary firewall companyright we use these things to fortify aperimeter it's pretty simple right we'retrying to protect what's inside thosewalls building up this firewallarchitecturewell that's no longer the most efficientattack Vector obviously because data isnot all stored there and even a lot ofcritical data isn't stored there so whatare we going to dowell we're going to look at identity asa primary attack Vector why because ifI'm an attacker instead of trying tobrute force my way into a data center ora cloud VPC I can just go on LinkedInfor a little while what company am Itargeting who's on the M A Team who'stheir executive leadership team and casta wide enough net of spear fishing rightsoLet's uh drop this in hereum it's going to go ahead andso when we when we go up go ahead andinitiate that spearfishing campaign allit takes is one or two clicks to get usto where we want to goand from there we need to do somethingabout that right if identity is theattack Vector we need to be able tosolve this so as we look at where theattack vector or the threat landscape ischanging we need to get we need to getmuch better at our approach how do we dothat we answer questions right so we sayheythis access needs to be grantedthere are a few things I need to knowfirst who who are you right so it allstarts with the user needing access tosomethingII apologize team I I thinkthis is my faultum I think my slides are a little out oforder here but that's okayShow Must Go On Let's Do It All right sousers need access to resources I'm goingto back up uh this slidewhen that user needs access thatresource what did I say about zero trustzero trust network access everythingstops right so you're there's noimplicit access between a user and theresource they're trying to access so thecloud intercepts that request for Accessnothing else happens from there until wedo a few checks right so every ztnaSolution on the market is asking acouple of questions of who and what whoare you what device are you coming fromwhat do you want to access based on youridentity the role in your organizationthat access will be granted to you rightand then okay you're off and runningthere's a third question that needs tobe asked that we ask not many others dowhich is what's inside so once we dogrant that access via policy are welooking at what's inside that sessionfor anything bad that could be happeningif the answer is no this is where westart to fall down and this is where weget into the identity based attackvector and we have to look at this fromseveral ways it's not just the outsiderthreat right the one that we know isgoing to is the example I gave beforeuse LinkedIn to cast a spear phishingnet or whatever else it's The Insiderthreat as wellif I'm a highly privileged user or apilot Networksand I want to do damage to some of myresources what's to stop me if I can login and Via identity-based access policyI have the ability to upload to a hostpackage up some malware upload itsomebody else downloads it nothing'sgoing to stop me from doing that so it'sthe external threat the internal threatbut then also the unintentional harm theperson that does accidentally click thatspear phishing link right so now all ofa sudden I click the link oh crapmaybe I'll be okay then I'm trying tolog into something so I get my MFAprompt and I'm like yep and then it'slike oh something else wait I alreadyclicked yes well I'm just going toignore it I keep getting this prompt Ikeep getting this prompt right MFAbombing happens I click it out offatigue all of a sudden now somebodyexternally has access to that resourcethe same access I havespoofing is becoming very sophisticatedthere are things we have to do to stopthat so now if we're sayingzero trust network access blocks thatinitial request for Access and thenstarts to look forward right providingthat access an identity based you knowaccess usage is going to be the attackVector the way to mitigate that is byasking that third question what's insidelet's walk through thisif we if we look at what Prisma accessdoes that's our secure access serviceedge right the whole idea is to identifyuser and device by asking the who whoare you what device are you coming fromall the context I need to know where areyou should my entitlements change if I'mnot sitting in my office but I even tookmy manage device to the Bahamas onvacation we view that as a high riskarea probably I probably shouldn't haveaccess to certain tools that I do in mydate during my day job right so it's allabout having context whois the you know who am I what device amI am I on and then the what which iswhat are my entitlements based on thatcontextshould I have full access at applicationlike I said read-only access uploaddownload if you think about a lot of ourprivate applications rightthey're not all sass aliketypically our private apps are built inthree ways to have prod and QA there'sreally no Persona based entitlements inthemso if everybody needs access everybodyin your company needs access to anapplication but the attribute level ofthat access is variable how do youcontrol that if you don't have layer 7based policy right so that's what thisis all about it's about ensuring that weknow who the user isfull context before providing accessokay that's the one and only giving themthe level of access they need to dotheir job truly least privilegedfrom therethat's when we start getting into thewhat's inside content securityinspection so once that access isgranted even by a policy hey I know whoyou are you've authorized yourself youhave access by policy I'm going to makesure you can't do anything bad to thatresourceeven a private application I'm going tomake sure you can't upload malware tothat private app I'm gonna I'm gonnainsurer you can't exfiltrate data thatyou're not supposed to right whetherit's intentional or unintentional harmthis is what mitigates identity basedattacks and threats is something in linecapturing this this session data whileapplying something like DLP to all thesethings right we're trying to protect ourdata protect users apps and data is keyto any cyber security organizationshould be key to you guys right if we'retrying to help you do the best thing youcan this is what we need to be able tosolve forso with thatlet's look at this an analogy right Ithink a lot of us traveled here I know Itravel all the timeif you're looking at ztna solutions thatare identity based only that's just liketaking your ID and your boarding pass tothe TSA or border officer here's mystuff and then all of a sudden they saycool head to your plane have a nice dayconvenient throwback to the old old daysbut pretty scarysome ztna solutions have added somebasic security filtering capabilitieslike looking at the OS top 10 some doingsome basic data filtering from ourperspective it's clearly not enough notfor everybody if you're a known travelerand you're authorized Global Entrywhatever fine we may have a littlelooser requirements for you but at theend of the day everybody else send themthrough that body scanner put the bagdown on the bag scanner and check thepayload that's our approachmaking sure that we're looking for knownand unknown threats once access isgranted via policy so I hope that makessense see like I said I'm a dummy and Ilike to keep things simpleso this allows us to get much betterdata when it comes to stopping threatswe sit in line we see all this trafficright we understand what's happening sowe can use AI to drive better securityoutcomes right seeing them the number ofthreats we see a day means we'relearningmeans you're benefiting right it's agood thing now everybody says cool hey Ilike security security is a good thingfor mebut at what cost a user experiencebecause every time we hear this I got toturn on this I got to turn on that Igotta turnit's gonna it's gonna slow things downand we're talking about how we improveuser experience right well that's reallywhere our partnership with Google shinesthe cloud service I talked about thatdoes all the security inspection andeverything like that we did not build itourselves we leveraged gcpyep just like most of you we're a gcpcustomer tooand that helps us right it helps usprovide the resiliency we need it helpsus provide the security processing atnear line rate speed that we needand it helps us ensure the performanceis goodwhich I'll get into why so that we canoffer slas around this stuffindustry-leading slasbecause I can say anything I want to youguys it's not going to matter until youactually try it or something goes wrongand you're like I got a problem here youbusiness impacting incident right putyour money where your mouth isso how does this look from ourperspective your perspective if you're acustomer of oursleveraging the Google Cloud gives usthings like well multi-zone availabilitysomething happens just like you guyshave with your workloads we've got dualtriple quad availability zones dependingon the region right we've got theability to isolate customers because ofthe expansiveness of the hyperscalers wehave instantiated data planes for eachand every one of our customers nobodyfeels a Noisy Neighbor condition so youcould send a hundred thousand usersthrough our service doing the exact samething the customer over here with athousand users isn't even going to feelitokay incredibly important when we'retalking about business continuity andresiliency making sure things work theway they need toand then of course scale the ability toAuto scaleif we have high demand events going onand you need throughput we don't want tochoke you we want you to use the cloudthe way you need to use the cloud solet's use cloud Dynamic resources tomake this a reality so let's take a lookat this in actionleveraging the gcp premium fiber Networkwhich we do for Transit users actuallyleverage it for connectivity so thisgives us things like well187 Edge locations maybe more now Idon't know it seems to grow all the timethe actual fiber interconnects betweenEdge and compute separating Edge fromcompute is brilliant why because whenEdge gets saturated you're diverted toanother one and then if the compute thenext compute region is saturated you getdiverted to another oneit's real easy making sure things stayDynamic using Cloud native networkingand servicesin the cloud native architecture itselfso we think about applications rightapplication access Google workspaceokay SAS app hosted by Google userIngress is into an edge location asclose then as possible they're on fiberto that cloud location wherever thatparticular work uh worker SASapplication settingright so super fast performance you'renot just ingressing into a cloud popegressing out of the same Cloud pop havea nice day because the rest of yourtraffic's over best effort internet toget there we're trying to eliminate thatmiddle mile variability and that doesn'tjust apply to Google workspace thoughour SAS performance SLA applies to otherapplications too Salesforce users yeahwe are too slack yep we are too so nomatter where this user is coming in fromno matter what they're trying to accessthey're not just going to be on theirown they're going to leverage that fiberNetwork to improve performance from oneend to the othernot just for SAS either this is also forprivate applications so when you connectyour cloud vpcs or your data centers oryour colos into prism access same thinghappens right us-based app pretty easyno matter who's trying to access itthey're going to get that fiberconnectivity whether it's a US userwhether it's an Australia user sameusers going to a UK app and use Fiber toget there rightjust a matter of ensuring that we canimprove performance end to end so thenwhen we talk about this right when wetalk about you know security being a keyrisk element that we we help you avoid Ishowed you that through ztna and abetter way to do ztnabusiness resiliency and continuity thisis how we do it with our partnershipwith Google Cloud ensuring that we havethe throughput the scale and thetransport for your usersbut nowthat last part that I started withright securely efficiently manageableuser experienceyou're sending your users cloud or orapplication traffic through our Cloudyou lose visibility to into ita lot of us that came from thenetworking side we used to deploynetwork-based application PerformanceManagement monitoring tools across ourlands and lands and data center networksand things like that so if we sawbottleneck we could identify itquickly triage it remediate and minimizeuser impactusers remote applications and data goingto cloud and SAS a lot of that goes awaythat visibility goes away we need to getit back how do we do that by ensuring weprovide end-to-end visibilityintegrated into our endpointconnectivity client integrated into oursd-wan premise devices we go segment bysegment hop by hop through theapplication delivery path making sure wesee everything we possibly canthis way when something does go on Thisis highly simplified of course but thismeans that when something does go wrongwe can see it identify it and dosomething about it incredibly importantwhen we think about the scale that ournetworks are using so then as we do thisyou get a dashboard right you hop intake a look what's the health of my myworld what does my network look like doI have a lot of green up there well Ihope so but if I have some red up herelet's click into that right some ofthese circles that have a little bit ofred what's going on let's see let's takea look or if we've got a lot of red orisolated red due to a particularapplicationoh there's another big collaborationtool that's uh host out of the packNorthwest that has sporadic outages inthe Chicago area all the time huh guesswho's it's who it's affecting everybodyin that General vicinity we can clickinto that we can see it so people aren'tnecessarily calling us they can call theprovider right they can do something alittle bit more intelligent but then youget that in view this is what it lookslike from your perspective managing thison a day-to-day basis for your forensuring your user experiences is Keenand up to speedper application so you got two viewsright so you got a dashboard looking atthat path and then you've got a perapplication view how are my applicationsperforming and if something's wrong whyis it wronglet's dig into that and find out so thisis all feeding data this is where AIstarts to really help understand thingsand get it get better at things likedetectiondiagnosis and Remediation right becauseif we see all this stuff happening inline both from a security perspectiveand a networking perspective there arethings that we can do about thiswhether it's Proactive or reactivebecause it's something we haven't seenbefore but now it does know so maybe nowthe next time we see the same thing itdoes become a proactive response but inorder to do that we have to haveconsistency in the tool set unifiedsassy because a lot of organizations arelike well I get the concept of sassy alittle bit I like to build it myself dothings myself yeah but then you've gotanother set of logs that you're tryingto Aggregate and collate and make senseof right if you use a unified sassyapproach you've got all of this trafficgoing through it so you're seeing youruser traffic your branch traffic to anyapplication across any networkno matter where that application livesso from a security perspective somethinghappens an event happens you deal withitwhen a service impacting trafficInterruption happens you can deal withit you see it it's happening in the sameplace it's delivering better securityoutcomes for usso now when I talk about what thosesassy based outcomes should be protectapps and usersor App State users have some dataum ensuring that we're simplifyingthings while improving user experiencewhat AI does for us is it amplifiesthose right it's ensuring that we take alook at things in a better approach andsay heylet's use AI to have better securityoutcomes let's sit in line see all ofthese threats do something about it getbetter at zero day detectionthese threats are becoming moresophisticated all the time you've got toget better there's no such thing as areactionary approach to this anymore allthe big guys that got popped over theyears they didn't not have tools intheir environment to stop this stuffthey just weren't using them properlythey weren't getting good data out of itright this is about improving thatsimplification you can do that when youhave a unified approach because nowwe've got fewer tools we think about allthose potential access methods whetherit's human employees human non-employeeslike third parties and contractorsdevices applications all of those areusers because they're consumers of yourdigital resources so making sure thatall of the tools that provide useraccess to information data andapplications is Unified simplifying thatenvironment and then of course userexperience can be improved because wecan improve day two operations throughend-to-end visibility and observabilitysowe don't just you know talk about thisand say heygive us a try you think you'll like uswe get a little validation too so fromour SSC perspective security serviceedge which is a component of sassy andsd-wan which is the other component ofsassy we're the only vendor that is inleader quadrants for both mqs but thenjust last week if anybody noticed thatwe were the only single vendor sassyleader in the magic quadrantone of the things that we heard duringthe evaluation which was interesting waswhile everybody else seems to be playingcheckers you guys are playing 3D chessoh that was pretty cool so we're seriousabout what we're doing Palatine networksagain known as a firewall companytypically a lot of you probably know usfrom our Prisma Cloud capability thinkabout prism access again what gets yourusers to that edge that cloud Edge wherePrisma Cloud takes over from thereprismaccess and Sassy into prismacloudtwo different capabilities but a muchbetter together story when it comes tothis so when it comes to AI though lookwe could say the future of sassier's AIpoweredbut it's not everything I talked abouttoday is here now and available todaysoI will have time for some questions ifyou have some there is a mic here at thefront that I was supposed to tell youabout earlier before I startedum but it is here so if you do havequestions please use itum but still uh send some feedback okayit is appreciatedumI don't necessarily get paid on itbut I appreciate positive feedback ifit's okayumand I just want to thank you all foryour timeforeign"
