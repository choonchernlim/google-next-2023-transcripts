about thatum my name is Marcus Oliver and I leadthe Delta transformation practice inGoogle Cloud Consultingum phenopsis obviously a core part ofour practice because it's you knowcrucial for for successfulTransformationsum cloudfinops has become a criticalcapability for critical capability setfor anyone interested in the cloud andlike many aspects of the cloudautomation is a key part of thatstrategytoday we're going to look at phenoxAutomation and particularly how that canbe used to drive and reinforce culturechangeso there are many challenges thatcompanies face to implement robust CloudFinance capabilities for exampleestablishing granular cost visibilityaccurately budgeting and forecastingCloud costs and deploying effectivecontrolsbut I think what companies find the mostdifficult challenge is to change humanbehaviorwhether as individuals or as teams andorganizationswe all have a strong tendency to stickto customs and processes that we'refamiliar with and many of us myselfincluded quite frankly change is hardwe're going to hear for some experts onhow they've achieved this changeso to introduce the Fantastic panel wehave today I'd like to pass the bet onto my colleague Bruce Warner who leadsthe office of the CFO practice and isalso a cloud Finance practice lead hereat Googlethank you Marcus and good morningeverybody and welcome I'm really excitedto be here today as we talk aboutAutomation and how that can be used tosupport a cost aware culture and drivefin Ops and across the organization sowe are very fortunate to have with ustoday three leaders who have been deeplyinvolved in their respectiveorganizations cloudfinops strategies andautomation initiatives today we haveCarol Rodrigo and Chris so first let'smeet Carol Carol's the director of cloudFinance at Palo Alto networks Carolplease tell us a little bit aboutyourself and the fin Ops Journey at PaloAlto networks hi everyone happy to meetyou I lead our Cloud Finance team atPolito networks my team is responsiblefor reporting forecasting and planningfor cloud cost and also optimizing onthe rate side including optimizing cutcoverage and negotiating with the cloudproviders we also work very close withour engineering teams on optimizationsand sharing best practices and helpingthem quantify the impact of some of thethings that they doin the last five years we've started ourmigration Journey to the cloud and thisstarted with us expanding our cybersecurity product portfolio and now mostof our products are actually hosted onthe cloud in the last two years we'vespent a lot of time on automatingvisibility and alerting and now we arevery focused on automatingtooling to enable our Engineers to takemore action so I look forward to sharingmore and thank you for having me greatthank you Carol it's really nice to haveyou with us todaynext I'd like to introduce Rodrigo soRodrigo is a site reliability engineerand finops manager at globoRodrigo please tell us about your rolein The finops Journey at globo perfectI'm glad to be here representing theawesome Global professionals my missionat Global is leading fine Ops SRE andCloud programs Global is the largestMedia company in Latin America it bringstogether open TV beta TV channelsdigital products and services forentertaining and informing almost 100million people daily in Brazil by 2021we decided to partner with Google Cloudto run our workloads accelerateInnovation and our digitaltransformationand we were also using different Cloudproviders for specific needs withnon-standard processes and governance sowe decided to embrace finops andreaching and uhthis developing our own tools throughautomation to have to to help us keepthe budget under control bothtechnically and financiallyin this journey people and processes arealso very important we were able to workwith a multi-functional finops team sideby side with Cloud users to harness thecloud spend without slowing down ourCloud Migration by the way we migratewithin 18 months 400 groups ofapplications composed by thousands ofmicroservices and we really were able tokeep this under control and I'm glad tobe here to share with you our learningsthat's terrific Rodrigo and thank youand we're really excited to hear moretoday finally I'd like to introduceChris so Chris is the vice president ofsite reliability engineering andplatform services at Equifax Chris tellus about your role in The finops Journeyat Equifax thank you I'm very gratefulto be here and represent all the greatcolleagues I have at Equifax so my nameis Chris Frye I currently leadreliability and platform services forEquifax Workforce Solutions I've beenwith Equifax for more than 16 years andfor the last three years I've had thepleasure of leading our local TechnologyGroup on our finops journey much like mycolleagues on the panel here we'reundergoing Cloud transformation andCloud migration and so we've beenundergoing that Journey for the lastfour yearsover the last three years in our finopsjourney we've been progressing if you'refamiliar with like the finops foundationmaturity model we're progressing alongthat path right so we're somewherebetween what I would say is Walk and Runand most of the work that we've donethis year has been really focused onunit cost and unit cost economics andI'll talk more about that later in thefirst year we probably did what a lot ofyou all have done already which is totackle that low hanging fruit and findthose big expenses and cut those out andin the second year we really spent a lotof time on forecasting and working on ashared cost allocation andaccountability in our organization weare highly collaborative across multipletechnology groups and finance right thisis um we cannot be successful withoutall of our partners internally in thecompany our service delivery is alsohighly matrixed in our organization andthus in order for us to be successful atcontrolling our costs the entireorganization has to be successful atmanaging this costs and we'll talk alittle bit about that later and I'mexcited to share some of those learningswith you that we've learned over thelast three yearsthat's terrific Chris and thank you andwelcome and welcome Carolyn Rodrigo yourorganizations clearly have a wealth ofexperience in cloudfinops and Automationand I'm sure the audience is eager tolearn more todaynow in case you are new to cloudfinopslet's start with some foundationalConcepts first off what exactly iscloudfenops now while the term finopshas been around for many decadesas core Finance operations processes ittakes on a whole new meaning whenapplied to Cloud technologynow at Google we see cloudfenops asmerging of two Core Conceptsfirst is a governance and operationalmodel that spans not only the financeorganization but technology and businessas well doing things such asestablishing effective cost visibilitycost controls and driving efficient useof resourcescreating metrics that demonstrate thevalue of investment in Cloud technologyand integrating with budgeting andforecasting processes as wellthat is combined with a cultural changeone that drives broad organizationalaccountability for costs and of coursethat is an absolute key to achievingvalue from your investments in Cloudtechnology and achieving the ROI thatyou seek on your Cloud Investmentsso cloudfenops addresses both highlytechnical considerations such asresource pricing and Architecturaloptimization strategies as well as veryFinancial ones as well such as theplanning and forecasting process and howthe business measures the p l impact ofinvestment and technology and the valuethat creates for the business so acomprehensive fin Ops strategy mustaddress a governance model that spanstraditional lines of business leveragescloud-first principles and usesautomation strategies to scale impactso what kind of cultural challenges arecommon for companies to face whenthey're moving to a cloud-basedenvironmentso the approach to how Legacyinvestments in Data Center Technologyhave been managed can have a largeinfluence and capex heavy data centerenvironments a sunk cost mindset can bevery pervasivetechnology infrastructure from serversto storage and networking infrastructurewhile they've been previously purchasedand ongoing consumption of thoseResources by engineering teams Bearslittle to no impact on current costsnot surprisingly these types ofenvironments can have limitedorganizational visibility to costs andrelated metrics and Leadership whilethey may maintain a point of view thatvisibility to those costs should belimited to a narrow executive audiencenow compare that to a public Cloudenvironment where consumption of cloudresources directly drives incurred costsand you have a dramatically differentenvironmentso whether determining architecturesizing resources determining theappropriate pricing model for use ofcloud resources those will all have adirect impact on incurred Cloud costs sohow can companies pivot to this newmodel and drive that large-scaleorganizational change well Marcus isgoing to share some thoughts on thatJourneys and at the heart of thelarge-scale change is a set ofprinciples that will guide through thattransformationso Cloud embodies the agile organizationfrom a more Dynamic approach totechnology development to how budgetingand forecasting are approachedfundamental to cloud is a variableconsumption model that has the abilityto expand and contract resources andrelated costs as demand variesso this requires a new level ofcollaboration and partnership across I.Tfinance and The Businessan accountability model whereapplication teams are responsible forthe efficiency and value realization ofthe resources they deployso finally blamelessness is a coreprinciple that we Champion here atGoogle some would say that if anorganization is not you know makingmistakes they're not taking enough riskand so-called mistakes are theopportunity for everyone to learnto learn and improve on existingprocesses and capabilities and to do soin a way that focuses on the issue andnot the personso one of my favorite definitions of ofculture is is how do people behave whenno one's lookingit's the touch points it's the corebehaviors and how teammates actuallyrespond to them that Define thecompany's culturesso a key goal of phenox capabilities isto enable their engineering nearingteams to take action on cost byproviding real-time actionable andinsightful datato achieve that an organization must beopen to sharing the cost data it has tobe visible visible we need visibilityand that data must have a level ofgranularity so that Engineers canquickly associate that data with theapplications they're responsible forit must be actionableone of the other things I like mostabout Google is this is is the fun rightmaking work fun and I think thatgamification of phenopsis is a great wayto do thatthrow out a challenge to your team soyou could drive the biggest cost savingsthat month see the passion and energythat that can result from thatcombine that with an atmosphere wherethose achievements are celebrated andshared and you'll have the groundwork toa continuous learning organizationso you'll hear from Chris a little bitaround some innovative ways that thatthey're doing at Equifax where it'sgamifying and celebrating the successyou'll hear from Carol on on how PaloAlto alone Palo Alto networks is usescontinuous learning and sharing andyou'll hear from Rodrigo about enablingEngineers to take action at globeso now that we've set the context we setthe principles and the objectiveslet's dig into the detailsso Carol let's start with you can youshare with the audience a little bitabout the types of cloud for not toautomate automation uh efforts that yourteam has been developing pleaseyeah there are many ways that automationhas helped us drive finops culture atpolitical networks first we automatedvisibility and alerting for example weaggregated Cloud costs across our Cloudproviders into one standardizeddashboard and we automated the costallocations so now this enables ourcompany speak one language when it comesto Cloud costs across Cloud providersand it provides a one place for theBusiness Leaders to go to see theirCloud costs real timewe also built some slack alerting whereit can alert on anomaly and budgets andthat helps Business Leaders remediateearliermore recently we've been starting toautomate execution as well for examplewe've built tooling to automate our cutpurchases and also slack alerting whereEngineers can click a button and shutoff idle instanceswe are also now experimenting with doingAdvanced analytics or PredictiveAnalytics to see if they could do abetter job on forecasting and also onCut coverage recommendationsso maybe let me share a few examplesso the first thing we did was westandardized our cost definitions tohelp Drive functional accountabilityso what we did is across the cloudproviders we had a same set of costdefinitions as you see here and we brokedown the build cost into cost componentswhere engineering teams have controlover and cause components where Financeteam has cost control overthis is all now automated and itprovides better accountability andvisibilityto started to create that framework Iimagined it created some tension in theorganization what did that process looklike how did it work as far as gettingeverybody on the same table and anagreement on how costs should beallocated definitely change is nevereasy as you mentioned so when we firstcame up with the the framework a lot ofpeople that we worked with especially onthe product teams were like this is notthe cost that I've seen and why is itthis way and so I think it wasdefinitely a process educational processso we did go team by team we showed themhow our costs mapped to their cost sothey understood where the differenceswere and we explain to them the reasonwhy we need some standardized definitionotherwise we wouldn't be speaking onelanguage at the company so I think itdefinitely takes time for the culturalshift but I think with education andClarity on the objective of why we'redoing this we were able to get them onboard sounds like it takes a good doseof time patience and collaboration toget therelet me show you another example so hereis a dashboard that we built for theengineering teams this is engineeringuse case so in this example for gkeresource we show the configuration sofirst the engineering teams need tounderstand the current configurationalso the utilization of the resource andalso what is the cost impact ofdifferent recommended actions that theycould takeand I think by we did this for both CPUand memory and this is a real-time youknow automated visible visibilitydashboard for the engineersum and I think this really helps enablethem to take action no you know thewhat's the configuration and then whatwhat is the impact on Savings of some ofthe actions that's recommended to themcommon shared resource in manyorganizations and I can imagine that wasalso a bit of a change in a shift forthe engineering teams to think abouttheir respective costs so can you sharea little bit with us their reaction whenyou first deployed this type ofdashboard yeah when our Centralengineering team first showed them thisdashboard and similar other you knowother tools similar with for otherresources I think the First Reactionswas the engineers were actually verygrateful they were very grateful thatactually they finally had this abilitybecause I think a lot of people want todo what's right they just don't know andwith all the cloud costs and all thepriorities the engineers teams deal withwe want to make it easy for them we wantto make it visible and easy for them toknow what to do and what is the impactand help them prioritize the um theiractions so I think this actually they'vebeen very happy and grateful to embraceand now it's all about figuring outtheir prioritization and how does thiscompare to some new feature that may bebuilding and I think that that's wherehelping to quantify the impact reallyhelps them on the prioritization partnext we're going to hear from Rodrigoabout some of the efforts that he'sleading at globohi sorry we focused first onorganizational alignment and visibilityby automation we ensure that every cloudexpenditure had an assignment managerand team responsible for that costs sowith this visibility we bring budgetspending shared cost allocations andoptimizations opportunities to managersand Technical teams also this helpedmanagers understand their own costs andreally technical teams explore availableopportunities to improve efficiency inthat moment we also helped the POSunderstand how to forecast their costsand to meet business demand and also tokeep everything under control they lookat dashboards and work on efficiencyuh what were really good in oursituation this kind of discussion uhrecently is part ofimportant kpis for Value streams areasso this also bring collaboration to thetable and help Empowerfinops adoption at our companyso after ensuring visibility we workedon organizational alignment sorry afterensuring visibility we work in parallelon efficiency and alerts as well asproviding apis for allocating shareddatalet's talk about efficiency we canautomatically identify and manage yourscale using standard Google kubernetesfunctionalities through our own pastcalled suru however applications can'tat true must also handle certain spikesin demands with more than 20 timeshigher than the normal peak in less thanone minute in our case because wewe work in a media component and we haveaccess based on breaking news and alsoreality TV show moments in thesesituations they Standard Auto scalingwaiting times doesn't work in and do notit's not sufficient and we had tocombine different techniques to avoidperformance issues and also waste oursolution was to pre-warm ourenvironments usingprogrammatic scaling based on timeWindows as we Define it as Flags thisworks well when we work when weunderstand the possible time intervalthat we may receive the large amount oftrafficwe are also exploring new ways to toimprove efficiency using machinelearning with these insights we aretrying to predict the demand and scaleenvironments in advance it it isstill helping us to find out goodbalance between efficiency andresiliency this last two groups ofcapabilities helped us to break downsales between teams and create new waysto exploreopportunities to improve efficiency andwork together in innovative ways to savemoneyhere you can see our overall high leveldesign our environment is designed toensure that projects are creating thecloud using Omni API we are amulti-cloud environment and we have toensure that when we create a project wereally know who is the owner theseplatforms ensures the the projectsinside have the right architecturestandards security requirements andgovernance as default Omni API isintegrated with our itsm system too andalso with Erpwe unified the way we collect thebuilding data into a standard raw dataset where we used to allocate sharedcosts andwork with apis to really share with theteams their datawe also receive key performanceindicators from Google kubernetes toprovide recommendationsgolden signs as an example for beingpackingcomparing usage with the actualprovisioning size so theserecommendations help us to driveefficiency alsobi's tools are used to spreadinformation to different personas ininside Global and we we have a way toreceive new forecasts from the teams andalso toreallocate costs when we when someonefigured that the is not responsible forthat costso uh Rodrigoum in what ways has this automationstrategy uh really impacted the globalorganization can you talk about some ofthe results some of the uh the the thethe impact that that you've been seeingyeah automation has helped us to createa consistent data location that is veryimportant and techniques to startbalancing the efficiency with resiliencybecause we need to keep thethe application is running even if wehave a large amount of access so it's ahard work but we are doing well andlet's talk about the resultswe successfully kept our budget undercontrol in 2022 in a year of ourmigration with less than one percent ofvariation this was to the accountabilitywe created with data and also with thetechniques we could share with thecompanyshowing them indicators that drive thethe opportunities for efficiency alsothank you Rodrigo these performancestatistics are a strong indication ofthe progress your organization has beenmade particularly in a highly Dynamicmedia-based environment so congrats tothe team on the excellent work nextwe're going to hear from Chriswho's going to talk about the experienceat Equifaxhey thank you so one of the first thingsI'm going to talk about here issomething that Marcus mentioned earlierrelated to culturewe recognize and reward our run ratereductions or other efficiencies so inour centralized team probably like in alot of your centralized teams you oftenidentify the inefficiencies and you askproduct teams or Engineers to takeaction but of course we do the samething but we don't do all of that rightwe expect that our product teams arefinding those inefficiencies and fixingthem without even our input but we dowant to recognize and reward that so wehave those engineers and those teamsrecord those savings and those wins andwe just do that through like a Googleform that even records that in a sheetand then our Central team will go backand validate at month end that thosesavings are actually achieved and thenby recognition we have you know severalcalls but we have a monthly Meetup withall of the stakeholders related tofinops and our products and we call outthe top two winners from like the lastmonth month on those run rate reductionsand those efficiencies and we also givethem you know rewards in our internalBravo point system so that's one waythat we kind of like crowdsource and weget everybody engaged in Saving thesecond thing that's similar is forecastaccuracy is very important to us andvery important to our finance Partnersso we look at actuals to forecast andthen we in the same way we reward thepeople who have the closest actuals toforecast right I mean that's very veryimportant to usum the other thing just related toforecast is as we progress through thisjourney over time we found thatforecasting does take a good bit ofeffort from our teams it initially was alot of plugging numbers intospreadsheets and we're now exploringways to automate that to produce thoseforecasts centrally and to save sometimethe second thing that I want to mentionon here is moving from anomaly detectionto alerts to actionsso this is just maybe an example to walkyou all through so logging can be alarge source of cost in the cloud Ithink you all probably know that andoftentimes you might have an engineeringteam that leaves on debug level loggingwhere they run some sort of large loadtest and that generates thousands ortens of thousands of dollars of logs sowe all you know in the initial stagesyou find that through anomaly detectionright you might see that the next daywhere you might see that the next weekwhenever you get the large bill right sowhat we what we've done is in thatparticular example right you pivot fromanomalies to looking for what's actuallythe signal what and alerting on it rightso we will set up through automation forall of our containerized workloadsalerts around log volume so think aboutlike 10 megabytes per second over 10minutes right so if you cross thatthreshold then we deliver alerts to ourplatform team into our product teams tosay hey there's a problem right and sothat's something that we've done throughautomation that just comes out of thebox in our platforms but we'll take thateven one step further now and what wewill do is we'll automate deletion ofthe workload in non-productionenvironments when it triggers that alertright because even one hour or two hoursof excessive logging does cost us quitea bit of money the third thing I want totalk about here is that we have a highlymatrixed organization I mentioned thatearlier with a lot of interdependencebetween service is and we can't delivercost-effective services without thesupport of the rest of the organizationand so we centrally collect cost andalso unit data and we do that inbigquery and this allows us toillustrate the cost to deliver ourproducts and how they're built formultiple services with multipleresponsible parties and then thattransparency allows our team and ourproduct teams to focus on the mostimportant areas when it comes toreducing costsum and then and so and then what thisenables um say a dependent organizationto not just see the cost that theycharge back to us as like one largebucket of whatever that dollar amount isfor a service they might provide likebilling or authentication but it allowsthem to see how that breaks down intothe actual delivery of the product sothis next slide will illustrate thiscapability so this is a mock-up here ofa visualization in looker Studio off ofdata that's in bigquery uh just toexplain some of the data a bit uh it'sthe unit cost breakdown for a product uhgraphed over the month so the y-axis islike a total spend in dollars uh they-axis on the right is the unit cost andthe unit cost is also represented bythat black line so the stack bars hereshow the different components that makeup the shared cost so like the black barmight be the direct cost that a productteam controls about the production ofthe unit and the other bars mightrepresent up other shared services thatwe get from other parts of theorganization so like I mentioned earlierthat could be something likeAuthentication or billing right so um aview like this enables all the teams allthe teams to understand where to applyfocus in run rate reduction effortsthat's quite a journey I've been drivingChris I'm curious did you experience anypushback or resistance across theorganization as you drove these effortsand uh if you did how did you approachdealing with that that's a greatquestion of course there is a pushbackacross the organizationumif uhwhenever we're looking into the areasthat are driving costs rightum especially when they're outside ofour organization uh the otherorganizations the other organizationsdon't like Outsiders necessarily comingin and surveying and telling them howthey're running their operation and howthings are too expensive right sothere's a natural human friction therewhenever that happensum but we have to get past that right wehave to be collaborative becauseultimately you can see the cost toproduce the goods that we sell you knowmade up in that graphand often then what you will see in theorganization as you make this journey aseverybody transitions to this modelsuddenly you will have Finance partnerscoming to your organization with theirhandout saying hey you owe us this moneyfor this monthly bill where it wasn'tyou know as previously as Brucementioned earlier it was all cost thatyou maybe was never seenso here's just maybe three things abouthow we can overcome that um havetransparency in the costs like shownhere right it becomes everybody'sscorecard right the cost to produce theunit is everybody's business andeverybody's responsibility in theorganization discuss units right anddiscuss unit costs so contrast these twostatements if I sayI don't know let's say 200 000 a monthis too much for authentication does thatsound as good as if I if I say somethinglike four dollars is too much for alogin right so contrast those twostatements when you're working with yourstakeholders if you can break it downinto something that's more meaningfulthat helps and third maybe I it helpedus to establish a chargeback policy sosomething isn't a great simple as anagreement to do like a showback for onemonth before a chargeback comes reallyhelps reduce the friction because no onelikes to show up no one likes to receivean unexpected bill from another partnerright and you don't even have a chanceto understand the bill or understand theunit costs or understand like how tohelp them optimize that charges they'recoming to you so have them come firstfor a month to show and explain the costbefore it actually maybe is a truecharge back in the next monthokayuh have one final question I think foruh for you all soum for each of you can you share onepiece of guidance that you can providefor the audience as they begin theirJourneysCarolum so I would say you know automationvisibility and tooling is just the firststepum to you know really get adoption ofphenops culture I think requires oneexecutive sponsorship this is a culturalchange it can't happen without executivesponsorship and the second is I wouldsay have a strong phenops leader thatcan influence without control withoutDirect Control so they need to be ableto do the right stakeholder managementposition the right way and so have aspinop leader that has that capabilityyeah data drives Behavior accountabilityand also awareness efficient efficiencyis the consequence but success dependson how you care for and support yourteam in their daily based decisionsas a pronounced practitioner we need tobring collaboration to the table notjudgmentso also be transparent in every costallocation decision because it canreally impact the way you treat yourpeople inside and adapt things whennecessary because cloud is evolving andprocesses needs to evolve as wellum echoing similar sentiments herephenopsis a multi-disciplinary journeyif you're in technology like I am makesure you have a good Finance partner orgood and a good sourcing or purchasingpartner right show and share the dataand have clear targets and then reachacross organization lines to helpachieve the results that are mostimpactful to the businessgreat thank you all very much veryinteresting insights so we'll have sometime for some q a so if you've gotquestions feel free to line up at themicand at the uh while we're waiting forany questions to queue up uh just aquick question like what's next wherewhere do where are you all going nextbased upon your significant uh you knowCarol what's next on the horizon at PaloAlto for us it's uh you know theadoption of so we have a lot ofvisibility and tooling and great as wellnow now it's to engage the team by teamchange the culture you need to educatethem and work with the product team sowe're in the process of going team byteam it'll take some time fantastic allright I see we got some a line at themic so okay first questionquestion for Carol you demonstrated adashboard where you had gke costsunder utilized over utilized CPU costEtc so that was that dashboard out ofbox or you had to do some engineeringchanges to get thatno it was not actually a lot of thetooling is built in-house and we didevaluate all vendors I think for us afew considerations one is the amount ofcloud spend we have it'd be tooexpensive to vendor secondly it's Uniquelike each of your environments productsthe way that it works is very unique soI think it worked better for us tocustomize it for our internal needsthank youthe product feature request for GoogleisAssociation of labels and and costingreports for example if you look at AWSthere are tags and that you can runcustom reports based on just tagsDepartment business unit applicationsapp owners whichever way and our ours isa global organization and inability torun those fine detailed reports justbased on labels is just limiting usuh yes so we're aware of thatum historically Google has invested inlabel-based architecture we're nowpivoting to tagging as the Strategiccapability we have a very closepartnership with our billing and costmanagement product team which is arobust product pipeline to introducethose capabilities across the productSuite so stay tuned that's coming weunderstand the the need and we'redriving development there thank youappreciate the feedback next questionhi I'm prashanth Devi I work for one byToyota so thank you all the panelists itwas a great Insight today so my questionis to Rodrigoum so for I mean the architecture thatyou have shown it looks great fantasticso do you guys use any tooling apartfromum what is natively available in thecloud providers for the multi-cloudcourse visibility as well as kubernetescourse visibilitythat's why my first question and thesecond one isthe data feed that you have shown is ita kind of daily feed or is it a kind ofmonthly and what you do with the appsheets and the uh that piece which isnot very clear in the descriptionwe choose to build our own tools becausewhen we figured that we would migrate ahuge amount ofworkloads to the cloud the way thesolutions to manage Cloud costs werebased on a fee of our total cost so thebetter way to us to address thischallenge really was building our owntools and we use the Googlefunctionalities with bigquery schedulerCloud run to code our applications andreally work on that situation to bringthis solution to work and the secondquestion we about the timing we receivedthe data we receive the data as thecloud providers enable it to be importedso in a daily basis we show all of ourdata with with the consistenceabout the yesterday day you know so thisway we treat this this challengeand the app sheets and the the top partof the architecture that was not veryclearso maybe I can connect you offline yeahplease thank you let's talkhey I'm also curious about the tags andlabels like when you have multipleresources multiple teams and maybe evenmultiple projects under differentorganizations is there a way for you tocheck ifor impose some kind of tagging syntax orprocess to actually check if certainresources are not tagged or labeledyes we can address that in a uh offoffline conversation here on the sideafterwards so if you hang around for afew minutes happy to address that surethank youhey good morning I know this on a coupleof slides you mentioned uh rewards andgamifications so maybe a two-partquestion if you could um elaborate onthat or some examples and the secondpart is how manual or automated is thatprocess of issuing Rewards or really youknow your gamificationsyes I'll just briefly kind of coveragain and we can alwaystalk offline too soum I would say that we areall of the tooling to gather the dataaround analyzing the rewards and of thatright that's all automated but we stillhave a human kind of in place to analyzeit there's a lot of factors that go intouh who you might select as a winner in aparticular month right becauseoftentimesum you can't necessarily go by absolutedollar you might go by percentage butthat's our is our ask to theorganization to basically pursue uh runrate reductions or cost efficiencies andto findum the the sort of the biggest savingsthey can find we're also exploring someother areas where we might try smallergames like it might be a[Music]find all the reductions you can get innon-production right or who can have thelowest cost running over the weekend sowe're thinking about other games that wecan introduce but we just haven't donethat yet and and the aim is obviously tobring visibility to that right theorganization needs to see that for it tobe effective and work so yeah yeah youhave to make sure that everybody playsthe game right and the rewards areeverybody everybody sees the the thewinnersall right thank youhi this is tree from MX this is aquestion to the panelists so in one ofthe diagrams you showed that how the rawdata from multi-cloud is gettingnormalized and I at the far right I didsee for uh dashboard view you had usedlooker so was there any specific reasonor what were the key considerations foryou to use looker as opposed to othercost managementtools was there any specific reason yesas aGoogle user look here provides us a wayto easily manage the data we can providefor the teams in a way they can createtheir own views also so we broadly uselocal in in our company because of thatwe choose to keep using these two toshare the informations okay much easierto customize and yeah to get customizedyes in our case thank you and I'll sayin our case too I there'swe need a lot of customizations there'sa lot of different stakeholders andthere's a lot of different financialdata so I think we've just naturallymoved towards building our ownvisibility to get what we want I don'tthink that there's there's not a singleoff-the-shelf solution that captures allof the needsgot it thank you so muchgood morning my name is Ryan withdropping Technologies and I have aquestion for Chrisin regard to the gamification of costreduction and for run rate reductionsare you differentiating between costavoidance versus cost reduction in thecase where you did right sizing versuswe deployed a well-sized instance atfirstso we do differentiate between that andthat's part of the analysis that happensmonth over month when we're reviewingbut I guess I one of the things that wehave to be careful about isum I think we're typically looking atthose run rate reductions versus costavoidance where we're not necessarilyanalyzing a team who said like hey youdeployed the right size instance whenyou started I don't know that wenecessarily have a game for that we'reprobably more gaming that around ourforecast and our accuracy right so ifyou've planned well through thebudgeting process and you know how manycores you were going to use and you knowhow big your database is you've built anaccurate budget and an accurate forecastand then when your actuals fall in linewith that then that helps but yeah youdo run into some things whereyou may be you may be thinking thatsomebody might just over provisionintentionally to win the game butfrankly we're all too busy for thatright so but I I get we do have thoseconversations and really they're justhonest mistakes when that happens got itso it sounds like two different gamesthank you thankshi uh Ron Curley with shiptimagine a non-hypothetical companythat uh has got all the data that itneeds by accident in some respects justdue to its CI CD pipelineumbut has no internal drive in the companyto dedicate Engineers to building outwhat we already have the attribution isthere the showback is there thesegregation and all of that but there'sno drive to get more Engineers todedicate any more time andtake thatum we also struggle with that at thebeginningum and one of the things is that one isthe executives need to see the benefitand impact that this would have so oneof the first things we did is weimproved our cut coverage because that'seasier to to do and and finance that'ssomething I have control over so byincreasing our cut coverage we were ableto realize tangible and sizable savingsand so I can show my exact say if I justhad one person that looked at thisregularly and I had the dashboard ofvisibility this is how much money Icould save and I think it makes a littlebit more real for them I think Financeis also generally a good partner forthat because there's always a piece ofmargin profitability management and Ithink that can often be a driver to saywell what is the ROI and and why thisshould be a worthwhile investmentit is super critical to have seniorleaders sponsorship and supportespecially across technology and financeand The Businessso we strongly advocate for a governancemodel where you have a steerco functionthat's overseeing finops it's gotrepresentation from your CIO CFObusiness leads and when leadership getstogether and as a team drives this thatmodels the behaviors and models thechange and the transformation for theorganization so it's super supercritical to have senior leadershipactively driving the transformationso I think that's uh all the time wehave will be on the side here forfurther questions thank you all forattending thank you there are severaladditional fin
