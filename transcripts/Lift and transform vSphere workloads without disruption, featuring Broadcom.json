    "transcript": "foreign[Music]and Welcome to our session where we'lltalk about how you can lift andtransform vsphere workloads withoutdisruption featuring broadcommy name isengineer with Google cloud and with me Ihave Manoj Sharmawho is a director of product managementwith Google cloud and ganeshanaki Ramanwho is head of platform engineering withbroadcomtoday we'll cover why you should chooseGCV what's new with GCV broadcom'sJourney with uspower of partnership call to action andthen conclude with some q aso let's talk about why should youchoose GCV in the first placethere are several things that are top ofmind for it leaders on one hand arethere ever-present requirements ofoptimizing cost enhancing security anddelivering the availability thatapplications and businesses needon the other hand every company istrying to harness the part of artificialintelligence and Cloud transformationlet's dive into this furtherwhen we put this in the context ofEnterprisesvsphere Powers the majority of computeworkloads in on-prem environments andthere are 85 million vsphere basedworkloadsthe challenge this createsis businesses need to choose betweenlift and shift and refactor andtransform every dayon one hand are the businessrequirements of enabling growth andtransformation leveraging The Best ofdata analytics artificial intelligencemachine learning and security whereas onthe other hand it operatorsare trying to optimize cost minimizerisk and downtime and maximize the useof existing Investments that they havealready madeThe Dilemma this creates is how do theseorganizations rapidly transform whileminimizing risk change management andexpensesdo they lift and shift today and dealwith the transformation in the future ordo they refactor and transform nowbalancing the two often requires certaintrade-offs forcing it leaders to eitherchoose lift and shift which is low riskand effort but requires a long time toenable transformation or refactor andtransformwhich enables fast innovationbut requires significant upfrontInvestmentsthis is where Google Cloud VMware enginecomes into play for these Enterpriseswe are taking a unique approach when itcomes to providing a cloud-firstexperience for vsphere based workloadsin Google Cloud using our first partyoffering Google Cloud VMware engine orgcbaGCV accelerates transformation whilebalancing risk and Agility enabling usto meet our customers where they areit delivers a dedicated VMware privateCloud infrastructure in Google Cloudwith vsphere esxi for compute we standfor shared storage and NSX for softwaredefined networkingsince we are running on vsphere you caneasily migrate your workloads to GCVwithout any change or disruptionyou can continue to use the migrationtools that you're most familiar withsuch as hcx and once you migrate over toGCV you can integrate easily with otherservices to further accelerate yourtransformationlet's look at some of the features ofgcbeGCV is a first party offering similar tocompute engine or any other service inGoogle Cloudit is sold and delivered by Google Cloudit is also supported by uswith GCV you can quickly provision a vmlprivate Cloud dedicated to you usingself-service within an R and instantlytake advantage of Auto scalingyou can get capacity on demand orthrough terms subscriptions using anOpex fashionsince the service is delivered by us wetake care of platform deploymentpatching monitoring security andautomatic repetitionthis frees you from the effort ofmanaging your own infrastructure so thatyou can focus on the workloads that'scritical to youit also provides integrated billingunified identities and access controlsthat enables easier consumption ofvmware-based workloadsonce you migrate your workloads to dcvyou can also quickly integrate withservices like bigquery and Cloudoperationsusing private connectivityfurthermore you can extend yourecosystem of Enterprise applications andservices as you migrate over to Cloudwithout any changeswe have partnered with leading isvs tooffer Solutions such as backup disasterrecovery and remote desktopthese partner Solutions include rubriccohesity and VMtherefore you can continue to use theEnterprise applications and it toolingthat you need to run your business inthe cloud without making any changes ordisruptionwe have also partnered with NetApp tooffer storage solutions for VMwarecustomers in the cloudan Enterprise grade platform let's lookat some of the differentiators that weprovidewe provide 99.99 of uptime SLA forclusters with 5 to 32 nodes and ftt oftwo are greater without requiringstretched clusters this is higher thanany other alternative out therewe also offer dedicated connectivitywith core service functions such as vsanand vmotion that enables us to provide aplatform that's highly stable andavailablethis also allows us to supportEnterprise applications that are highlyavailablesecond deep networking integration withNative networking functions such as VPCgcv's networking is built on top ofGoogle's powerful networkingarchitecturewith simplified Regional and Globalnetworking modes you can create a VPCSubnet in any region where this serviceis availablethis also allows you to architect Globalnetworks without the need or overhead ofcreating and connecting Regional Networkdesignsthis is not the case with other Cloudproviders where you have to configurespecial networking to connect differentregions for example creating vpns overwide area network to enable globalcommunicationthe challenge this createsis it adds to your complexity of bothoperations and deployment in addition tocostthird we offer the largest cluster sizeswith up to 32 nodes and clusters withour dedicated placement group designand last but not the least we offerdedicated 100 gbps of East-Westnetworking without bandwidthoversubscriptionthat's not the case with otherAlternatives that often requirebandwidth over subscriptionour GCB nodes also come with redundantswitchingboth of these features are especiallyimportant for Enterprise workloads suchas databases that are mission criticaland also latency sensitive applicationssuch as real-time communicationGoogle Cloud VMware engine is availablein 18 regions including some newadditions in Milan during Delhi andSantiago we offered the same phone ninesof uptime SLA for all of these regionswhere GCV is available insome additional regions such as LondonFrankfurt Sydney and Virginia we areoffering additional zones to supportcustomers that require higher levels ofavailabilityand with this I would like to inviteManoj Sharma to talk about what's newwith Google Cloud VMware enginethank you shantiniI am Manoj I lead the VMware engineproductand I'm here to talk about what's newwith VMware engine and some excitingdevelopments as well that are in theworks with this productso our customers have been talking aboutyou know what really matters to themthey are really focused on reducing costof the infrastructure making sure it's agood fit with the right TCObut at the same time they want to havethe right skill and advancedcapabilities with automation withoutcompromising on the Simplicity thatthey're that they've come to know andlove in the productand at the same time they don't want tocompromise on what we all care aboutwhich is security right I mean you wantto make sure you get all the visibilityall the tooling that you need in orderto get the most secure deploymentsand then finally it's not just about youknow solving problem a by deployinginfrastructure solving problem B by youknow adding some tools in it and so onand so forth customers want to solve allEnterprise needs holistically whether itcomes to availability you know whetherit comes to data protection businesscontinuity everything should be built inand not have to you know sort of toolyour way into getting to the right andand State uh in production and when youla when you're live and so we are tryingto meet those needs as well and thenfinallyumyou know customers come to Google Cloudto get the best of cloudand to Avail of all the advances thatare possible in the cloud and what we'reall witnessing is the advances in Ai andgenerative Ai and so we'll see get asneak peek on what we are doing in thatspace uh in order to help VMwarecustomerssolet's talk about the first exciting uhannouncement and development that wehave in VMware engine which is the ve2platform so a current node type wascalled ve1 VMware engine 1 and it had acertain configuration but with HCI assome of you might be aware ofhyper-converged infrastructure whichincludes storage and compute the problemis it's like a one-size-fit-off fit fitsall approach which means the address iseither going to be loose fitting or it'sgoing to be tight fitting most of thetime and that doesn't work when it comesto cost right so what you want to do isto have a platform that gives you theflexibility of choosing the right levelof compute and CPU compute and storagethat you want to allocate to yourworkload so that you can get the bestTCO and we obviously offer it atdifferent price points and so what thishelps is if you have a database thatneeds a lot of storage then you canchoose the larger storage form factor ofve2and if you have vdi which needs a lot ofcompute or you might have a memoryintensive workload then you can chooseone with Less storage and once again asI said you know that gives you a betterfit it comes with the later generationIntel CPU as well which in ourbenchmarking had 50 percent lowerinter-thread communication latency whatthat means is your database transactionsruns faster and your vdi interactionsMouse clicks are that much more snappierright so I think we're giving you latestgeneration infrastructure but alsogiving you flexibility of configurationto choose at the right optimal TCO andwe are releasing the ve2 standard 128which is one version of the CPU andstorage configuration first and it youknow reallygives you a lot more capacity than wehad before including more than two and ahalf times of the memory that you gotwith our current node typenow a similar version of that problem isstorage so let's take the example of Drwhere let's say you're trying toreplicate a lot of data you have anactive active Dr from on-prem to thecloud and you're replicating a lot ofdata into the cloud what you need to dothen is to have a lot of storage in yourenvironment and maybe limited amount ofCPU and you want to keep adding storageby adding uh you know some some sort ofyou know tier two sort of storagecontext but how do you do that in HCIwithout having to you know Mountadditional external storage which isalso possible well if you want to keepthe HCI form factored the hyper convergeform factor which is to have storage inthe same cluster the high performancestorage that comes with nvme but nothave to pay for compute and so you canleverage you know really highperformance primary story then it'spossible with the storage only node typeand the the good thing is that we willbe offering this with ve2 as well and itcan save you at least 75 it'll be itwill save you at least 25 percent uh ifnot more depending on the type of nodetype you you choose in order to meetyour storage needsso uhnext up is networking andthe analogy I like to make here isbuilding the houseso what you have to do when youconfigure VMware in the cloudis that you build a house but then youhave to worry about bringing theplumbing into the house as well rightand you have to actually lay out theplumbing yourself connect to the cloudvpcs and then do the interconversionsometimes you have to set up routerssometimes you have to configure uhpeering with multiple cloud vpcs and uhyou know all of that's super complicatedand adds to operational overhead andcost and time to manage and so forthand this was already much simpler ingcve you didn't have to do all this sortof routing configuration and managementyourself but you did have to initializethe peeringnow what we're doing is we are sayingyou know what when you make the housethe plumbing comes with it as part ofthe uh the consumption sowhen you first create a private cloud ingcve now you will get this peering thatuh goes into the cloud VPC automaticallyautomatically detected and automaticallyconfigured on your project and we callthis zero config networking and so zeroconfig networking is the new developmenton the networking space that will now bepossible with uh with our nextGeneration networking called VMwareengine networking and it's also a veryflexiblepattern and Paradigm for us because itallows you to configure multiple vpcs inthe same private cloud or a many-to-manyconnection from uh from vpcs to yourprivate clouds or to connect withexternal Services partner services suchas IBM NetApp or others or even connectto projects that are not in the sameorganization as yours external projectsso you can have some sort of a partnerbased service connected to your VMwareenvironment so this kind of flexibilityin networking you know when you startdoing Advanced things you need thisflexibility but in a very simple way sothat you're not spending all your timetrying to manage uh you know this messof wires of virtual wires but massivewires of connectivity and we make itpossible and easy with VMware enginenetworkingso now I'm going to talk about threethings that address the security aspectthat I talked about right the SecuritiesParamount in the cloudand the first of these is what we callVPC service control Solutions whichessentiallyin VPC service control what is uh whatthe the policy you can set is that Idon't want any exfiltration meaning nooutgoing internet connection from myenvironmentso that uh you know the environment'ssecure I know that there's no externalservice being offeredaccessed and that's now possible thatthat is possible with VPC servicecontrols in the cloud but but with thesolution it's also now possible onVMware engine environments as well sothis is the first security measure thatwe're releasing the second is visibilityand audit you want to know everythingthat's happening in the environment youwant to know who's doing it when it'shappening where it happened what itchanged and it was possible with VMwarevcenter syslogs it was also possiblewith NS nsxt syslogs and then thecontrol plane logs but for the firsttime we are now offering ESX log as wellright so ESX is the host operatingsystem logs and we manage the the hostand the operating system the es6operating system butuh we are giving you visibility intothat as well so that you know exactlywhat's going on in your environment andyou have total visibility for giving youthe peace of mind that you need in thecloudand then the third thing in security isAccess Control now what was possible sofar was an administrative level ofcontrol and then a viewer level ofcontrol in gcve but now what we havedone and this is already released is theability to do fine-grained accesscontrol if somebody is managingnetworking they get exactly thatconfiguration if somebody's managingstorage they get the storage managementrights and um and so on and so forthuser management administratorAdministration logging etc etc right soyou can imagine all sorts of roles thatyou have in your organization you canbring those roles through fine-grainedpermissions applied to every singlefunction available in the platformand we'll be continuing to enhance thiswith more and more granularity as timepassesokay so that covers security now comingback to Enterprise needs I mentioned heywhen I want to set up something inproduction I want all my needs to beaddressed holistically whether it'sabout external storage you know it mightbe file stores that I'm accessing fromvdi environment or I might have tier 2storage or I might have Dr protection Iwant all of these needs to be addressedso the first thing in that space is theexternal storage with file store andNetApp both are you know equallysupported options that we are offeringin our platform and that allows you toaddress the needs of storage expansionand storage growth and data protectionthat I talked aboutbut the second area that we are focusedon is to make ait uh very easy and push button for youto get data protection and businesscontinuity for your workloads so weoffer the VMware platform the VMwareplatform has an ecosystem a very largeecosystem of data protection andbusiness continuity as you all know youknow whether it's veeam or whether it'szerto or whether it's some EMC solutionand so on and so forth you can sort ofbring all of those as add-oncapabilities and layer it into theplatform and they are fully supportedbutyou also in some cases want to use theprovider native capabilities and youwant it to be built in you don't want toconfigure you know the tool yourself andwhat we're announcing and offering isthe ability to get this data protectionthroughgcp native data protection and BackupTool which will be now bundled can bebundled as part of gcve through thisgcve protectedadd-on skew and what this does is itgives you data protection at a fixedcost so you pay five percent of theinfrastructure costand you can use unlimited capabilitiesyou know back up as many VMS as you wantand the software is going to bebasically working seamlessly uh withoutyou having to configure and managethings explicitly you just have to payfor the storage uh depending on theamount of data protection you're havingthe external storage that that thisservice uses it uses GCS to backup yourdata so that's what you will be payingadditionally forall right and so now I'm just gonnatransition but before that uh I want totalk about something exciting sowho in the audience here has been usingthe VMware platform for more than 10yearsso about you know 25 30 I think if notmoreand when you come to Google Cloud youknow you've you've given us the veryimportant responsibility to manage yourenvironment and make it available to youas a service but you know with thisrevolution of generative AI happeningaround us it's Google's responsibilityto give you all the power and capabilityof generative AI to make your lifesimpler and better you should be able tohave deep knowledge and insights aboutyour environment you should be able tohave an understanding of exactly all thedifferent parameters and optionsavailable to you you should be able touh you know generate scripting andAutomation in seamlessly and easily andI'm happy to mention today that we areworking on this we're not announcingavailability yet but we're working onthis and it'll be uh you know in previewsoonwhere you can do all of this and it's avery special capability and very specialespecially for for VMware because it'sit's doing it's giving you somethingthat's not built into a duetexperience yet which is the ability toget insights for with your inventory andthis is an extension of the duetcapabilities that you heard today thatwere announced today but an applicationof that into the VMware space so I'llstop talking it's better to see the demoand get a sense yourself of how thisworksokay so what you see first isdeep insights on your inventory and theway we offer this is privacy preservingwhich is that all your inventoryinformation stays local to yourenvironment it does not go to the largelanguage model service that we uh thatthat we leverage in the we need thebehind the scenes we are actuallyleveraging vertex Ai and you do need tohave access and registration toward xaiin order to use this but it stillpreserves privacy by keeping your datalocal the second thing you see is deepinsights it gives you you knowinformation about all aspects of thestack that you're consuming and uh it'svery knowledgeable about that and thethird thing you'll see is automation youcan generate scripts about yourenvironment and you know whether it'spower CLI terraform or python-basedscripting it's very knowledgeable aboutthat and it can save you a lot of timewhen it comes to performing Advancedadministrative tasksso with that I'm gonna pass the bet onto Ganesh and uh he'll take you throughthenext parthi everyone my name is Ganesh janakaramI head platform engineering at.coma small factover uh well over 99 percent of internettraffic that traverses throughsomething somewhere broadcom we areimmensely proud about thatwe are technology leaders in thesemiconductor and silicon space we'realso leaders in infrastructure softwarelikewe thrive in Innovation and we have apanoply of well-differentiated productsin several verticals and we includingCutting Edge Technologies likegenerative AI both on the silicon andthe software sideat the end of the day it's all aboutsound financial model the robustbusiness that drives Diversified andsustainable Revenue which is reallyimportant to ussowhat does our software portfolio looklike right so from Mainframe to mobilewe power enablemaintain automate Monitor and securesome of the world's largest most complexand Mission critical systems for ourcustomerswe have products both on the on-prem andon the SAS space primarily go throughacquisitionson the portfolio side Mainframe is avery important part of our portfolio TheWho's Who of the world still activelyuse Mainframewe have leadership in several otherareas in the undistibuted side likevalueops with products like rally andClarity in the monitoring space withnetops app Neta and AI Ops right but wehave a wide portfolio of securityproducts covering almost all dimensionsof of security from identity managementto network perimeter security all theway to securing your your last device wecover the entire Spectrum in terms of interms of solution rightuh we acquired a semantic a few yearsback with that we have uh products likesemantic endpoint security that protectsmillions of devices uh we have Marqueenetwork security product uh in the websecurity space uh ursphile blue code wehave caspi DLP secure access so we havethe complete portfolio of solution forsassy and then ztna we also have apayment security solution if you'refamiliar with verified by Visa weco-developed that and we continue to bea leader in that space as wellnow coming to our journey with GoogleCloudwe have had a very symbioticrelationship with with Googlewe were probably the first billiondollar company that adopted G Suite westill continue to use that and we ourforeign software kind of started withthe acquisition of brocade and that'swhen first set of workloads we startedmoving to gcp but uh things startedmoving along the more traction with theacquisition of CA Technologies that isclosely followed by semantic when wedecided that we'll move all the SASproducts into Google Cloud right andthis was not a simple lift and shiftexercise we use the opportunityto transform them uh to be able to dosay like a 12 Factor app microservicethem containerize the applications andrun them in in kubernetes right sowe went through this transmission forall these SAS Servicesuh and uh we had shut down several datacenters in this process and this SASJourney was was a great transformativeone are we talking about our labmigration in a little bit and theassured workloads in a subsequentsession uh later this afternoon actuallynow as I said like we run all of our SASSolutions almost all of our salesSolutions inside Google so we have afairly large footprint we run in 39regions today several tens of thousandsof VMS we are a very big gke shop thestats go uh so on on and on rightbecause of our Global presence thediverse set of customers we are alwayssecure we go through all the complianceregimes like PCI DSS soft to fedrampit's it's really important for usbecause we hold a lot of customer dataI want to focus a little more on thisdeveloped Cloud conscious culture so theone that I talked about this Megatransformation effort that we took tomigrate or re-transform all these SASservicesto go through such an exercise there'sone critical thing that that we had todo that is to empower the engineer rightso I mean the engineer needs to have theright set of training resources theright set of tooling and the visibilityinto and into the environments withwhich they operate and that helps themgive the ownership and theaccountability in terms ofuh big enough accountable to be tooptimize the environment and make itmore efficient right so this is a reallyimportant part for again the largetransmission effort like what weundertook it's really critical that theengineer is at the center of thisnowyou're done with this largetransformation effortand even before we started sipping thechampagne we realized that we had aproblem right and more importantly wehad a bigger opportunitywhile I think folks that that buildproducts will will relate to this one ifyou have products both in the SAS andon-prem spaceSAS is typically the tip of the spearand on-prem solutions kind of trailbehind right so we follow a kind of avery similar approach where we moved allour SAS into into the cloud whereas wewere still developing and testing ouron-prem Solutions our on-prem productsin the in the in the traditional wayrunning these labs in the in the in thedata centersso we had like almost 165 plus uniquedevelopment and test labs and uh thesewere running in various data centers allover the world multiple office sitesthe utilization was pretty lowheight high TCLthe model was a was a capex model whereany kind of expansion took a lot of timeit was not easy for us to get anythingnew right and also from a technologyperspective the infrastructureperspective we had all kinds of all Huesand shades of of infrastructure startingfrom your small pizza boxes to all theway to the best hyper conversioninfrastructure that's availablenowthat was the that was the problemstatementand uh you may have heard this uhInsurance commercial I think it has avery catchy jingle as well but thetagline goes like thisyou only pay for what you need I thinkthat pretty muchcaptured like where we want it to beright from this state where we were inwe wanted to get into a state where wecould do on-demand provisioningwhen we need what we needto be able to start stopscale and to be able to pay only forthatif you want to improve our utilizationright and also have a platform that iskind of uniform and consistent where wedon't have all of these vagaries of ofinfrastructure rightthat's when you took a callthat's a simple one saying that we aremoving all of these labsLock Stock and Barrel into Google Cloudlike any of the large transmissionefforts it met with a lot of resistancethat at start people are evenquestioning like what are you smokingright so it's illegal now in the Stateuh soit took us some time to get past thosebarriers I think some of them uh we weretalking about environments where thereare hundreds of productsum againover 2000 Engineers right that areactively working with on these Labsacross all geographies time zones so itwas ait was a gargant to an effort actuallysothe good part about it was we were ableto explain the end State the end statewas the engineer had a lot more controlon on the environments than what theyhad now right the first the firstbiggest point and there are no morehidden costs you know no more costs thatare that you don't know okay you youexactly know you that the emitter isrunning and you know what you're payingforand the other important thing was aroundthe training aspect where we were ableto with the help of Google we were ableto get training for all of theseEngineers across the board so once theybecame more familiar with the the latestand greatest that the cloud offered soit gave them the the confidence thatthey will be able to leverage this rightand that kind of snowballed intoan acceptance and that's how the theproject started moving forward actuallyso once the uh and our goal was tomigrate whatever machines we had intoGCE andwe were using migrate for computerengine at that point in time uh I thinkwe also worked with Google on athird-party solution because we had uhhypervisors like ahp ESX and our privateCloud was running in openstack so we hadtowe had to find a converter that was ableto convert all of these so we found atool things are moving quick things aremoving well that's what we thought didwe hit a brick wall rightso there was a problem where several ofour products were actually builtin the ESX vsphere ecosystem like theentire automation the entire thing waswas built around thatwe also had products that had to betested in this environment in the ESXCasper environmentbut more more importantly wewere running various flavors ofoperating systemsbecause our just to mimic our customersso these operating systems could not berun in in GCEwhereas we had an easy option of gettingall of these things to run in GCV that'show we evaluated dcv and we adopted gcdeat that stage for for that exact usecase so once we started using itwe found the interface very consistentwith what we are we're familiar with onthe on-prem side it's the exact sameinterfaceand as shinethany mentioned uh it's amanaged offering you don't have to worryabout infrastructure Google takes careof the patching Google takes care of allthe upgrades things like thatand all the levers that we had on theon-prem side in terms of cost we stillcontinue to have them right so so itworked out of the box straight away okayand uh I think as Manoj mentioned uh weuse hcx to migrate from our existingVMware environment into GCV fairlyfairly easilynow today we have well over 100 nodes Ithink we're talking about 110 now below10 000 VMS which are running in GCVseveral clusters we use this opportunityas a good one like a spring cleaningexercise to clean up the stuff that wedidn't need we migrated I wouldn't usethe word lift and shift we lifted andtransformedand only what we needed right we rightsize the environments to make sure thatbecause now we are in an environmentwhere you could provision what you wantokay you can start small and then scaleup as you need right so in this processwe Consolidated thousands of machinesand we were able to shut down five datacenters rightwe were able to significantly bring downour costs I already talked about ouroverall approach in terms of being cloudand cost conscious that's a culture thatwe built ground up uh every engineeringengineer you you walk in broadcom itwill tell you like what their averagecost is right so that's the kind ofculture that we build based on thevisibility that one has right andthousands of Engineers now had access tothe cloud okay it's not just gcbeanymore they had access to things BeyondVMware where they had access to thingslike bigquery and the other servicesthat that the cloud offers right andbecause we moved from a capex to an Opexmodel it was much easier for us to spinup and spin down when we need and thedeployments are now taking minutes rightinstead of months weeks and months thatit used to happen beforeand last but not the least uh we use werealize Ops for our monitoringalerting and it helped us immensely interms of optimizing our environmentoopsso the outcomes I already talked aboutwhat we did for the developer at the endof the day it was all about liberatingthe developer right now they're notworried about the nuances of am I goingto get my infrastructure am I going toget this on time right so that got takenaway and uh it freed the the developerto to things that they do best to buildworld-class software right because theconstraints were removed it helped us toaccelerate the delivery and we alsocreated a community right where peoplewere sharing best practices people aresharing scripts people who wereexchanging ideas discussing problems sothat Community helped us to get theremuch fasterand last but not the leastwe had a great partner in Google withthat helped us thick and thin duringthis journey without which this is notpossible and a shout out to my team myextended broadcom team that made thishuge Mammoth transmission possible thankyou everyone thank you[Applause]thank you GaneshI think you know to get a partner ofthis scale to get a customer of thescale and to be able to see this kind ofJourney that changes so many lives isjust tremendous fear we're truly blessedand I think uh you know I think I reallyappreciate the cloud conscious culturethat you talked about and how you helpedbuild that in your in your context soit's truly phenomenal and I think alongthe same lines I want to say that thisservice and these capabilities buildingthe making the best of VMware and Googlewould not have been possible without thepartnership with VMware and I think uhfor that I want to get a message fromVMware uh in this session as well for usto all hear before we closehello I'm Krish Prasad I'm the generalmanager of the cloud infrastructurebusiness group in VMware very excited tobe here Google cloud and VMware has hada very close and deep partnership formany years it was just three years agothat we jointly launched Google CloudVMware engine since then we have seen ahuge momentum amongst our customers toadopt this cloud and it is now withoutquestion one of the top performingclouds that VMware customers go tocustomers really love uh the ability toseamlessly move their applications uhfrom their data centers uh to gcvebecause they don't have to think aboutretraining their people they don't haveto change their processes and tools andthey also can take advantage of some ofthe Native services that Google offersas an example in the AIML space thatallows our customers to then acceleratetheir digital transformation journey andso all of this has resulted in a hugemomentum for this service across manyIndustries and I'm very confident thatGoogle Cloud VMware engine will be oneof the top destinations for ourcustomers for years to come thank youvery muchall right so with that we'll close Ithink we just have a minute left we'llbe available here for questions outsidefor questions I know we didn't getenough time to do that but thank you alland uh thank you for coming and I hopeyou enjoyed the session"
