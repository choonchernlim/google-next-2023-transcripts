you're interested in your peopleor you're focused on the skills thatyour company needs to move it forwardI'd also imagine you're probablyconcerned about how you both attract andretain your talentand after this week I'm sure that withall that we've learned about gen AIyou're thinking about what kind ofskills are needed to keep up with thisnew technology or perhaps even morescary how do we think about new skillsand new roles for those people's whosejobs might have been displaced by gnaitechnologyand that's what I'm going to do over thenext 30 minutes is share with you that Ithink building a learning culture inyour organization is one of the bestways to set it up for success as wethink about this Dynamic World in whichwe live inthe world economic Forum has said thatby 2025 40 of the skills the tasks thatwe do today that will be obsolete sothis idea of the learning culturebecomes a key business imperative movingforwardmy name is Linda moss and I head upCloud Learning Services here at GoogleCloud where the team responsible for alot of formal training for our customersour partners googleers as well asthinking about the future Workforce andover the next 30 or 40 minutes or sowhat I'd like to do is to share with youthis concept of what is a learningculture and the importance of it to ourworld todaywhat I'm going to do is in the shorttime that we have together is coverthese following areas we'll talk alittle bit about what is a learningculture what we mean by it right when weuse that expression itself what exactlyis it and why is it important in today'sworldI'd then like to spend a large part ofmy time talking about the learningculture at Google how do we do it hereand how do we think about the philosophyof learning and building this continuouslearning culture where your learning isalways on so share with you someexamples then particularly about thearea in which I work which is cloudI'd then like to share some practicaltips about getting started if this issomething you've not invested in toomuch so far what are some of the thingsthe easy wins that you can be doing tothink about making learning moreubiquitous about your organization andthen lastly I'm hoping we'll have quiettime for questions and comments uh forthe last few minutes so does that soundokayexcellent all right thank you so let'sgo then into what we mean by a learningcultureand I thought the best place to start iswe talked about gen AI so much this weekwhy don't we start actually with askingBart our conversational AI chat functionabout what that thinks is a learningculture and Bart tells us that alearning culture is one in whichemployees are encouraged and supportedto learn new skills and knowledge thiscan help them be more productive engagedand Innovative in their work so in mywords having a learning culture is likehaving a shared set of beliefs beliefsof values that says learning andcreating Talent is so important thatwe're going to invest and prioritize itbecause we believe that developing ourpeople and supporting them in this waywill Foster their ability to grow engageand be more Innovative in the day-to-dayand I think all of us in technology willagree this has become so prevalent overthe last couple of years I mean thisisn't something related to gen AI onlythis is something that we saw with Cloudwe saw how the shortage of cloud skillshas really driven up you know salariesand the scarcity of talent in this spaceand we're seeing the same kind of thingsnow as we move into the Gen AI field andwe think the proliferation of AI and itsnatural impact here on companies andpeople's work will in the way that itdeplaces people's roles as well ascreate new rules the importance of thisis even more prevalent in the day-to-dayso let's talk a little bit then abouthow we think about this at Google atGoogle we got many what we call Pasorganizations that do things very verydifferently YouTube is very differentfrom cloud cloud is different to ads butthere are certain principles ofphilosophies we hold across the whole ofGoogle and learning is one of thoseand so those are the aspects that Iwould like to kind of go into over thenext few few minutes together in orderto have this consistent approach tolearning across Google we have somethingwe call an l d Council that is somethingthat keeps learning high on everybody'sagenda and ensures that we are allaligned in holding the philosophy ofGoogle high in the organizations inwhich we're part ofand in l d the l d Council we have thisMission here that again is focused onconsistency whilst uh also allowing forthe uniqueness of each individualorganization so as we believe here andthis really is underpinning what wethink of this culture of learning asbeing so important in the Google'sfuture will be defined not only by thegrowth of our products but the growth ofour people and to achieve this ourmission is to pursue a thriving learningCulture by enabling world-class learningexperiences for all googlers throughmeaningful growth opportunities andcreating consistency where we can whilstpreserving uniqueness where we must andas I talk about learning today whatyou'll see me talk about is not justintroducing formal learning programs Ilive in the l d space I live in theeducation space as part of the everydaybut a learning culture is more than thatand so you hear me talk a lot about theimportance of providing experiencesworld-class learning experiences andgrowth opportunities in the day-to-daythat really underpins the importance ofhaving that always on always learningmentality as part of the organizationand I think as well the mission of the ld Council again do allow that whilst wewant this overarching mission statementand have consistency we do want to allowthat uniqueness that makes theindividual Pas that are part of Googleso special and unique in all their ownwaysso we talk about this concept of alearning philosophy and I'd like toshare with you the five main elementsthat we think make up what we believeare learning culture consists of and asI go through then I'm going to introducethem over quickly and then I'm going togo through each individually and sharehow we at Google Cloud bring this tolifeso first of all when we think of ourlearning philosophy we think thatlearning happens in real life right myrole is to create learning programs andI'm passionate about quality learningprograms that we put together for allour audiencesbut I think we know that much of ourlearning happens in real life right welearn when we're challenged so learningdoesn't only happen in the classroomlearning happens in the flow of work andgooglers tell us every day that theylearn on the job and so when we thinkabout building a learning culture it'sthose kind of elements that we've got tobe very thoughtful and embed into theway that we approach the day-to-daywe always to also talk about learningbeing personaleveryone as theirassets and motivations about how andwhen and how they want to learnand so they can take we also believethat they take an active role in shapingtheir own learning so whilst you'll seethat I will talk about some formalprograms and experiences that we puttogether we also believe and we embed itin everyone that joins the company thatlearning is the responsibility of theindividual it is our role asorganization leaders or program ownersor even managers to provide thoseopportunities and spaces but asindividuals join Google again thisalways learning mentality is built intowhat we dothe third thing we wanted to talk aboutand I'm going to talk through is thatlearning is socialand googlers have told us that they turnto each other for information advice andhelp so when we think about learningagain we want to intentionally createlearning opportunities for Google us tolearn from each other as well as buildtheir Network and again as I go throughthese in more detail I'll share with yousome opportunities and some examplesabout how we bring this to lifelearning is all around it doesn't as wesay just happen in the classroom in froma book from a video and talk a littlebit about that and then when we do talkabout formal learning programs we thinkabout learning being a process not anevent it's not something you go to from9 till 12 and then hey Presto you walkout through osmosis having acquired somebrand new skill we believe to be reallyeffective it needs to be a process aswell so let's take a look at each ofthose in more detail and I'll share withyou a couple of examples particularlyfrom Google Cloud how we're starting tobring this to lifeso I think many of you know this uh rulehere the 702010 rule it's from McCall ishia andLombardo and as I said I'm part of thelearning team but and I'm very muchresponsible for the 10 at the end butthe belief here is that 70 of learningactually happens on the job part of theday-to-day experience and trying it outfor oneself20 percent happens in informal learninglearning from each other that sociallearning element learning from we usedto call it in the UK a bit of an oldexpression sitting by Nelly right you'dsit by a co-worker you'd learninformally from them shadowing andmentoring and then you've got that 10 ofthe formal learning and all this fitstogether and that's nothing new in thisI think this has been around now for acouple of decades but I think it's howwe embed it into the day-to-day and makeit part of the work life the flow ofwork that's become the more commonexpression that brings this to lifeI'm going to share with you a couple ofexamples how we do bring this to life atGoogle so the first thing when we thinkabout this learning happens in real lifeand 70 on the job experience first thingthat we make as part of work at Googleis what we call stretch projects or 20projectsit's very common as people get intotheir role after they've got throughtheir nuclear time which is what we callonboarding that we encourage individualsto look for those stretch opportunitieswe've hired them for a certain reasongood example maybe a consultantpotentially we've hired them as an infraconsultantbut maybe they we need them to startthinking about new emerging Technologiessuch as gnai here's the opportunitythrough these 20 projects that theystart to take on and learn moreresponsibility in this adjacent spacethe result again is it becomes part ofthe flow of work it's not extra it's notsomething they do in the evenings theyre-embed this into the day-to-day it'sbuilt into their expectations their mbosand it's part of the way that is justacquiring different skill setssecond one we have here is reallythinking about this 20 percent in formallearning somewhere where we've reallytaken advantage of this learning happenson the job is an early career programwe've run here at Cloud called uh ctrsCloud technical residence these areearly in career grants that come to usstraight out of University and we putthem through a nine-month program andthese elements of this 70 2010throughout this nine-month program thefirst three months they're learningthey're on the right that formallearning learning about the technologygetting certified all that good stuffand then we put them out into rotationswhere they're doing that informallearning and on the job they're part ofa team they're working with somebody alittle bit senior to them but they'reembedded in customer opportunitiespartner opportunities or wherever theyland as part of their rotation and thatcombination of having that formallearning with that wonderful safeinformal learning being shadowed andmentored and then reverse Shadow andmentoring really helps us firm newskills builds confidence which is a hugepart of learning and again make surethat that ramp to acquiring new skillsworks wellthe third one we also do is someone Idon't if anybody's heard the expressionbungeeum if you have googlers in the room I'msure they'll know that a bungee is againanother wonderful on-the-job learningexperience I don't know if it's the samein your company but we have a Workforcethat's a lot younger than I am and so wehave parents wanted to go out onmaternity paternity baby bondingly whichit can take up to five months so what doyou do in those situations you've gotjobs that still need to be done and sobungee opportunities are ones where youcan go and take another role for sixmonths while that person is away maybeI'm running a team of temp workers soI'm not really considered a peoplemanager at Google but a people managerhas left so there's an opportunity forme to step into that role to apply forthat role get that formal experience andagain build my leadership skills aftersix months I come back to my day jobthen but I've come back with these brandnew skills to be ready to step up forthe same opportunity in my ownorganization or perhaps an adjacentorganization as well so as we thinkabout learning happening in real lifeand in the flow of work these are thekind of examples that we think reallybring that 70 2010 percent aspect of learning to lifeembedding it into the day-to-dayso that's what we mean by learninghappening in real lifethe second aspect that I mentioned onthat first chart was learning ispersonaland as we said we think about this intwo ways learning is personal in thatit's about self-exploration it's aboutgaining knowledge it's about buildingconfidence as well as expanding skillsand again as we've said so it's personalin that way that an individual wants tolearn in a certain way but it's alsopersonal in that I said at the beginningwe believe that whilst we as managersabsolutely have the responsibility tocreate learning opportunities andprograms for our employees they'reactually learning and their skilldevelopment is their prerogative and thefocus that they should take ownership ofand I think you know if we we think ofall of us in the technology sectionsector this has been so important uhthere's always on always learningmindset but all we do as part of it isto build that into how we think ofputting together our our programs so twoexamples I'll share with you hereuh we have a learning platform calledgrow which is think about it as amassive library that is not formallyprogram oriented but it's there foranybody to access so maybe I want toramp up my project management skillsmaybe I want to get better innegotiation maybe I just want to kind ofget better in things like well-being andthink about how I best balance work-lifecareers lots of different topics therebut one of the things to help reallybring that to life is to haveinitiatives and programs that everybodyis able to access and that grow platformallows that personal go in take us takesome training take what you need andmove on it's your choice as anindividual that you go out and get thattype of learningthen the piece that we've done as partof this a new program in my ownorganization again working withConsultants we introduce for our seniorconsultant something we call aone-to-one programone to one is that again you've beenhired in one area of Technologyand whilst that's great we don't wantyou to stop there we want you to expandyour skill set so one means one majortwo minor one technology all this isimportant for our technology individualsto be Adept and to be able to advise ourcustomers our customers work indifferent Industries we want them to beensuring that they're equipped and up todate with what's happening in Industrieswhilst they may be great in onetechnology such as infra we want them tomake sure that they know what'shappening in other Technologies datamanagement even the network sidesecurity and so they are encouragedevery year to put down a new one-to-onethey'll always have their major who wantthem to be growing in that field and weexpect that as part of their role hereat Google but we also want them to bethinking of adjacent and building theirskills that are not only in Advantagefor them in being more marketable moreexpert but also for us as we need thebroad blood breadth as well as depth soone to one and again it's been a greatinitiative where individuals choosingwhat they want to focus on working withtheir managers to ensure that theirSynergy there and also accountabilitybut it's been a great way for us tothink about in growing the individualbut also for us as a company to grow theskills that we know we need more ofparticularly as new technologies growthird one we think of here I mentionedthis learning is social people lovelearning from each otherand that's the way it sticks buildingnetworks learning from each otherpeer-to-peer learning peer-drivenlearning programsand a great example I'll share with youfrom from Google here that has beenreally I think game changing as we'veagain allowed people and encouragepeople to learn from each othersomething we call Gita G Google toGoogle and that's googlers teachinggooglers and GTA G actually is aplatform okay it's a platform whereindividuals go out there and can accessin Empower sorry it empowers individualsto deepen their own skills and helpbuild the skills of others while scalinglearning across grow ten thousandgooglers uh annually I believe havetaken part and accessed the G2G platformwhich they can go out get hold ofmaterials that they then can use witheach other in formal team meetingsto kick off uh off-sites Team Buildingum aspects such as team buildingfostering team developing ice breakersto team Vision communicationpresentation skills Innovationcreativity skills it's a great way thereagain ofnetworking but also working withdifferent teams and helping each otherthrough these kind of opportunities soGTG has been a great opportunity therefor all of Google really to step upvolunteer and work with other teamsacross the organizationwe also encourage it learning as part ofour ERG communities our employeeresource groups where awareness andlearning about each other aboutdifferent ethnicities about differentbackgrounds as well as different topicssuch as well-being and aspects of thoseto take advantage of learning programsthat come out of those groups as welland what a great opportunity to havedifferent teams different groupstogether again learning from each otherand take on one of our large technicalannual Summits here at Google where it'snot just about product managers andexperts leading but again people sharingacross different teams what they'velearned how they did something we havethings aspects such as great wins whatwas the magicand what went wrong because we alwaysfeel that learning from things thatdidn't go as planned are wonderfullearning opportunities that can also behelpful to prevent other people fallinginso learning is social is the other onethat we think of herethis is something probably one of myfavorite when we think of learning atGoogle has anybody been to a Googleofficeanybody who used the bathroom at aGoogle officeyeah anything you've noticed you'venoticed uh in this in the bathroom stallthat maybe you don't see in othercompaniesexactly people point in here we havethese wonderful programs called learningon the Louvre Little Learning aspectsand tips and tricks that are there onall the uh on all the differentbathrooms if you're in an engineeringbuilding you may also come across codingon the canyou may even come across testing on thetoilet so again it's really undermineswith a little bit of fun that learningdoesn't have to be in one place it canbe anywhere it's all around us and weshould take the opportunity to thinkthere's always time and there's always aplace to be thinking about how we growour own skills and our skill sets thereand they changed that if you ever arethere they're changed every week to makesure that your learning is not staticthat you're continuing to uh developeven in those precious quietpersonal moments of every dayall right and then finally in this lastone of uh when we think of thephilosophy of learning obviously thereare lots of learning programs you knowand this is a huge area of investment Iwas reading I think it was an article inLinkedIn last week that talked about youknow as employers we spend aboutthirteen hundred dollars per person peryear in formal learning programs sogetting that right and making the rightinvestment is obviously core to thisaspect of building a learning culturethis area of poses near and dear to myheart because this is the day job buteven as we put forward formal learningopportunities we do think that to do itwell it's a process it's not an eventso as I think about that just to say alittle bit about what I mean by thatwhen we think about learning we thinkabout it in various stages first of allit's a it's about acquiring newknowledge right there may be a gap in askill there may be a new technology youneed that you don't have that now sothis this element of informationtransfer knowledge transfer that takespart that takes place in a learningenvironment and we think as learningprofessionals or as those puttingtogether courses make sure that there'sthat component there that we're beingvery very strategic and intentionalabout the learning and the knowledge wewant them to acquirebut at Google we're equally passionateabout that second one applying knowledgeI can watch things for hours thatdoesn't mean I can do anything and sowith all that we have we want to makesure that we're building the opportunityas part of this learning process toapply that knowledge in our formallearning programs if any folks have beenthrough it that's where our Hands-OnLabs come in right yeah yeah I'mfollowing I'm watching the demo cool getit get it get it all right now it's yourturn it's a different matter right sothat ability to kind of practice in asafe environment and it doesn't evenhave to be technology yeah that's whyall those things why I hate managertraining and Leadership training you'vegot to do the role plays right you'vegot to get into the simulations becausewhilst for me anyhow they're very verypainful they're very very helpful rightthey get they give me the chance topractice they give me the chance to tryit out in a safe environment and ithelps it's helped stickso we see learning is very much part ofthat so for every opportunity we havewhere is the application of the learningthere shortly after the knowledge hasbeen acquired right the video has beenread the trainer has got up and has madetheir points and taking you through thedemo timing is really important thereand then the other piece that I think isreally important to how we think aboutthis area of learning is validation soyes we've sat there we've watched thedemo or we've watched a video with thewith the great practice example we'vetried it out a little bit but hasanybody tested us in any way that itwe've actually got it right and we getit and we've got it well and that'swhere this whole area of validationcomes in for me in the area of TechnicalTraining we have this in the form ofcredentials or even what we callchallenge Labs right challenge labs forus as an example in the technology fieldis really just being given a scenariowhen you have to solve it right that's away of validating no tips no additionalprompts can you do it or can you not andagain building that in to the learningenvironment is a great way for twothings to to allow leaders managers tovalidate does this person know whatthey're doing you know particularly inthe area of Technology where we havesome very important and very complexenvironments and can the individual doesthe individual have the confidence to doit on their own and that's where thevalidation comes in and then thatactually that aspect of reinforcementwhere again we're now linking it back tothat learning on the job making surethat we're always having thoseopportunities to reinforce and take thatknowledge and apply it right inengagements for us a lot of you knowtechnical engagement for consultant it'sagain pulling together those othercomponents maybe mentoring and shadowingbut people are trying it out and havethe opportunity again to reinforce andkeep that knowledge uh top of mind sothose are the the kind of things that wethink about there learning absolutelynot an event but learning more of aprocess an ongoing aspect even if it'sfrom the formal learning side of thehouseI'd like to also share one of the otherexamples we have at Google of what whatI consider is one of the best learningprograms that we have we're veryfortunate to have had the ability toinvest uh in in particular the area ofleadership and Google has significantlyinvested in this whole area ofleadership with the belief that greatmanagers must be great leaders and thatis the primary driver for Google'sgrowth and successanda school of leadership but really hasdone some phenomenal work on providingformal learning opportunities againacross across the Google environment andecosystem I really believe that toFoster that needs to again Foster a bestenvironment for Learning and this iswhere even setting and surroundingsmatterso the Google school of leaders hasactually established something calledthe schoolhouse and I use this examplehere to say you know when we arethinking about optimizing learning in anenvironment and this whole concept againof a learning culture even the spacewhere learning takes place really addsto the experience and the stickiness anddoes it land and building those skillsand the schoolhouse is part of theschool of leaders was a spacespecifically designed to promoteDiscovery Space for Learning and reallybuilding some multi-sensory elements ofbuilding in creativity risk taking andall those kind of aspects so I'd love toshow an exampleum of it now because I think it's veryspecial about some of the the differentways when you're committed to a cultureof learning you're really thinking fromall aspectsand this is the schoolhouse herewelcome to the schoolhouse created bythe Google school for leaders[Music]more than a meeting space theschoolhouse is a home for Learning andleadership developmentthis first of its kind space is designedto promote curiosity creativity andinnovation[Music]three large sections for collaborationbreakout rooms for small groupsand an outdoor patiothe space can transform to createintimate experiences or FosterConnection in large groupsby integrating neuroesthetics it'sdesigned to engage our brain differentlyand impact how we learnthere's something to discover aroundevery cornerfrom curated Curiosities to an EdibleGarden the schoolhouse offers a uniqueapproach to learningready to come visit[Music]I know we're very spoiled aren't weum very cool place there that uhum again we leverage for leadership tothink about the best way to landlearning to really immerse oneself in itum but even even if we not not everyonehas the opportunity to do something likethat and that's one place that happensto be just up the road here in uhMountain View just hopefully you knowwhat I'd like to do now is move acrossto some practical tips that I think wecan leverage as we think about thiswhole concept of the culture of learningso moving on to a few things as we go tothe the last part of the presentationtoday a couple oftips that I think really matter are thatare easy to implement and that should bepart of everything that we doso one of the things and I think thiskind of sums up some of the conceptsthat I've talked about so far this wholeaspect of learning in the flow of workright making learning a priority andembed it into the flow of work andthat's something that we do as part ofworking at Google right I'm sure you allhave mbos you know what is the acronymMBO as kpis uh objectives expectationsall those cool things but one of thethings we make it part of the theprocess at Google is one of my mbos myexpectations needs to be on learning itneeds to be on developing and building anew skill set now that's something thatI can decide myself going back to thatlearning is personalbut this is something that we write downwe commit to we agree with our managerand we check in with our managers on andit happens at all levels of the companyright obviously thoseum newer to the company have a hugeamount of learning but those that aremaybe a little bit olderalso have learning mbos learningexpectations that we take very seriouslyso one of the ways there I think as wethink of a learning culture just make itpart of the expectation of what it is towork in your companyothers we do it in another example thatI would say is something we call leapum in this idea to build it into theflow of work quarterly learning planssetting the expectation again from acompany level that everybody will dothis kind of training this quarter rightbut it just makes it feel that this isnot something adjacent ad hoc this is anexpectation that if you work for thiscompany if you work in my team if youwork in my org that is part of who weare when it comes to this and reallyagain an important piece I think of thisaspect of a culturesecond piece here is encouraging thesharing of knowledge and this is back tothat social aspect of learningI think one of the Expressions is alovely quote isn't there that says Ithink it's uh Joseph Wilbert I wrotedown in my notes to teach is to learntwice it means that when you teachsomething you know to someone else youenhance your understanding of it sopreparing to teach a concept requiresyou to think about it potentially fromanother one's perspective but that canprovide again a deeper understandingand something that we have at Googlethat we call G thanks right it's a wayof formally thanking each otherit's a platform where we can recognizeand thank more publicly our colleaguesone of the main uses of G thanks issomebody has taught me somethingsomebody has shared their knowledgesomebody took the time to spend 30minutes one hour I shadowed them forhalf of the day so this whole concept ofencouraging the sharing of knowledge butrecognizing and potentially rewardingsometimes there's monetary valueattached to these G thanks as wellum is a great way to just say we expectthis of you we recognize this importanceand we want to recognize you for doingit as well so that whole concept ofencouraging the sharing and as I saidrewarding and recognizing is I believeone of the strongest ways to think aboutthis concept again of a learning cultureand then if you're in you know thinkingabout the programmatic element that 10percent of the formal learning a coupleof things right if you want to makelearning stick right and be impactfuland effective certain things so I'llpoint out two of the ones here that webelieveum gamification a word that's used inlearning an awful lot but that reallybrings it to life having a bit of funwhat awards leaderboards points uhcompetitions people by Nature I thinkare very competitive what a wonderfulway to kind of have a bit of fun withthe aspect of learning as well with thiswhole aspect of gamificationthe other one and again as I think ofthe learning culture where it lands isthe importance of all the peoplemanagers that we work with in ourorganization manager supported orleader-led I talked to one of mycolleagues and I was telling him alittle bit about this presentation andhe saidcreating a culture of learning all youhave to do is two things you have tomandate itand make sure you have visibility andthe numbers are sent to your boss hesaid then you got it you gotta sort itright that's all that's what it's aboutmandate it track it and report it toleadership watch that changebut I think that may be you know more ofthe stick than the carrot but it doessee a lot here I think about managersleaning in whenever we roll anything outuh in my team we try and involve themanagers first if we can get them boughtin we know we'll they'll roll it down totheir teams but also the ability as wellum as we think about this we found thatthe visibility and the tracking of howpeople are doing is really criticalright how can we ask our managers tosupport these kind of initiatives if wedon't show them what's going on so thatvery much is where things like thetracking the visibility and then backagain to that recognize and reward yessome companies go for the the stick welike to think much more of the carrotand the wins and the takeaways that wecan get for it so hence the importancethere of the recognition and the rewardand I think that's the last piece that Iwanted to share with you as part of thisaspect of ideas around a culture oflearning I'll end with another quickvideo this was just a team off-siterecently with the the focus to teachand to impart and to get our teamsadopting a new learn a new methodology anew process methodology and I've justcaptured a few of the things thathappened over those two days and so asyou look at it think back to what Italked about flow of work uh socialpersonal gamification fun because theseare the things that I would Advocate isones that make it stick make it last andcan absolutely build new skills[Music]good[Music][Music][Music]it's a gamification a lot of themanagers there but dancers I don't knowwhere that was going but this whole ideaabout having fun and creatingexperiences that are memorable thatpeople don't feel are you know yetanother thing that I have to focus on uhin part of my day-to-day role so as wewrap up and then I think we've got acouple of minutes for questions as wewrap up on this topic of building aculture of learning I'd like to leaveyou with one main takeaway rightMcKinsey in their research has told usthat a third of people leave a companybecause they feel they're not investedin they're not developing or they're notbuilding any skills a third of ourpeople leave for that reasonat the same time article from LinkedInlast week I read that LinkedIn estimatedthat losing an employee can cost up toone and a half to two times thatemployees salary to replace so I wouldAdvocate as we think about this topic oflearning and a learning cultureparticularly in this environment wherelearning and skilled Talent is at apremium building a learning cultureinvesting in our people is not just agreat idea it's a business imperativefor us all to be successful as we lookaheadforeign"
