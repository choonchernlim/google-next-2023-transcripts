special guest speaker fromAccenture MuhammadMuhammad esmev and he's going to alsoshare a customer story with us today sowe're excited about thathere's our agenda we're going to gothrough connectivityconnectivity is always a big part ofintegrationthe infusion of gen Ai and how that'simpacting integration integrationservices that we offer at Googleand specifically application integrationa new service that we just launchedwe'll share some customer stories fromAccenture and then talk about what'snext uh some exciting things coming upon the roadmapso here's the problem that we find thatour customers are havinglarge organizations have upwards of 500applications and these applications allneed to be integrated in some way witheach otherwith systems of record that might be oldLegacy systems on premises with SASapplications with custom builtapplications and so getting theseIntegrations built is a big challengefor customerswe've seen more and more SAS adoptionhappening as wellsowe uh we see this problem just gettingbigger and bigger as we gothere's 181 zettabytes of data createdis the estimate for 2025so there's a huge amount of data I'mgoing to just move this mic a little bitand see if that works betterto the right middleokay we'll see if that works bettersorry about thatso imagine thisyou have all those applications in yourecosystem alreadylet's have gen AI create a bunch moreapplicationsthis is what we're we're predicting isgoing to happen now you're going to haveeven more applications that fall intothis integration problem spaceso we're looking forward to helpingcustomers with this problem as wellforeigna set of sprawling integration tools fordifferent areas of integration which canlead to a lot of confusion there'sdifferent tools used for dataintegration for application integrationyou might have middleware tools that oldesbs that are on premises you might havetwo or three iPads Tools in your in yourtoolkit so having a common platform topull all of this together in one placecan be very very helpful for yourEnterprisewe think gcp is that right platform foryou to pull all of this integration datatogetherso your digital assets are the primaryvaluehowever those are spread among 500applicationsso you've got digital assets for yourMarketing Systems and the marketing uhCloud possibly you've got sales data ina sales Cloud you've got your Financedata in an Erp system right thosedigital assets are very valuable to yourcom your companyyou need to deliver a valuable productand service to your customers and theonly way that you can do that is byaccessing those digital assets throughintegrationso here are some of the tools that wehave in our tool bag of gcp forintegration services and believe it ornot this is not even a comprehensivelist of toolswe have apogee for API managementwe have application integration forreal-time business transactionprocessing integration we have schedulerfor invoking batch processes Pub sub formessagingworkflows for serverless orchestrationtasks for async jobs and of course wehave data flow dataproc cloud dataFusion for bulk data processing and ETLso we have a huge set of integrationservices available to our customerswhat we're going to do today is focus inon one of these boxes which isapplication integrationso let's talk a little bit aboutapplication integration and some of thefeatures that we havewe start off with a visual integrationdesigner it's drag and drop it's lowcode you can build quickly theintegration flow that you need betweenyour applicationsand plug and play connectors make iteasy for you to drag in the connectorthat you need for the task pull out thedata from a system update data inanother system call an API in anothersystem right and all of this is beingdone with low codewe also offer versatile tasks andTransformations which are all low codeso you drag in the task and then youjust configure itinstead of having to write a bunch ofcode for these transformationsit's a cloud native managed service soit's hosted by Google run by Google foryou it's the experience of usingapplication integration is like using aSAS application you log in you createyour integration you publish it and it'srunning you don't have to worry aboutruntime scaling all of those things aretaken care of by Googlebut how it works we always start with atriggerthe trigger might come from Pub sub forexample as a message based trigger itcould come from apogee or some otherapplication as an API trigger it couldcome from Salesforce or otherapplications as a change data capturetriggeror it could come from you know zendeskjira Cloud it could be scheduled to runonce a day once an hourum so these are the triggers that alwaysstart an integration once theintegration is started then it'll gothrough an orchestration layer this iswhere you drag the uh the processingblocks into your uh integration you cando data mapping you can do things likelooping you can make decisions based ondata contents for filtering and routingumthere's usually a connector involved youneed to look up data from a system youneed to update data in another system soyou drag a connector in as part of yourprocessing you might even do other stepsafter that connector so you can startputting this flow together so that itmakes the job easy for you whichnormally would be a lot of custom codethat you'd have to write and thenmaintain over timeso we have built-in controls foradvanced orchestrationwe try to make hard jobs simplefor example there's a scatter gatherpattern which is very commonyou may have a batch file that you wantto process you want to do it morequickly and so you can start offparallel threads with our for eachparallel taskand then we can wait for all of thosethreads to finish and you get a resultof a collection of the results backso instead of that process maybe takinga minute or two to process it might onlytake three or four seconds becauseyou've been able to do it in parallelit's as simple as dragging the 4-Hparallel task onto your palette andconfiguring itso instead of writing you know who knowshow many hundreds of lines of code to dothat it's very simpleso that's just one example of the kindof orchestration that we can do you canalso do retries as a configurationcustom messages error handling all withdrag and dropit's tailored for your use case so youdrop into code when needed we providepunch outs to JavaScript to Cloudfunctions so you can write in go or Javaor python as wellbecause we know that low code isn'talways going to be able to solve themost complex problems so we're trying tobalance that mix of giving you a lowcode experience but then giving you theoutlet to be able to drop into code whenyou really need towe ensure High resilience andavailability we're in 23 different dataregions in five continents and we canadd ourselves to other gcp regions asthere's demand as wellso we take advantage of the gcpecosystem as well we're plugged intoCloud monitoring Cloud logging secretmanagerand I am just to mention a few uh wealso have connectors into a bunch of gcpservices as well that's coming up in ain a few slidesso you can automate your businessprocesses there's a lot of manualprocesses that people are doing you havethat swivel chair approach where youtake data from one system and then typeit into another system cutting andpasting right we can help you toautomate those flows so that whensomething has changed in one system itautomatically flows to the other systemgets transformed along the way and youcan make sure that people aren'tspending that manual effort to do thatyou can connect to your systems withPlug and Play connectors and we'veworked with customers on severaldifferent use case areas so you'll seethe bubbles on the bottom of this chartwe've categorized these use cases intodifferent major categories like sales alot of people want to do salesautomationum servicemarketing HR supply chain projectmanagement and this is just the tip ofthe iceberg there's a million differentuse cases that you can Implement withthis tool this is just some of thecommon ones and your use case may falloutside of these as wellso we have many third-party connectorswe have 75 connectors right now andwe're adding more and more every quarterso we also have connectors to Googlecloud servicesand this makes it much easier for you toconnect into things like translate andDoc Ai and vertex AI imagine being ableto orchestrate and automate yourumyour gen AI right into your businessprocess so when data is being updated inone system you can have it flowingthrough vertex AI to do something like asummarization for example before it getsloaded into another system of recordwe also have connectorsumwhich are in previewand you can see a list of icons here forpreview connectors these are the onesthat are coming up next and if you'reinterested in any of these we canactually turn that on for you so let usknow if you want to try it outespecially if you want to give usfeedback on whether it's working or notfor your use case and we can basicallyallow list your gcp project for thatokay I'm actually going to hand it overto promote oh I'm going to do my demonext sorry forgotI'm gonna just switchscreen hereokay so I'm gonna just play a videobecause we've been having someinteresting networking issueswe're going to go through a use casewhere we're going to drop a PDF fileinto GCSwe're going to run it through ourintegration using a pub sub triggerwe're going to run it through docs AI todigitize that and then insert it intotwo systems of record one is Salesforceand the other one is bigqueryyou can see here The Logical diagramwe're going to get that file from GCSthrough Pub sub actually GCS has a wayto notify Pub sub when a new filearrivesthat sets off our trigger but then we'regoing to send it to docs AI we're goingto go first get the file from GCSconnector send it to docs Ai and then wewill update Salesforce and bigqueryusing our connectorsforeignokay so this is the medical claim formthat we're going to drop in as a fileit's a paper document maybe this wasscanned in by a printer scanner which isuh plugged into GCS maybe someone drugit from an email onto their desktop andthen loaded it to GCS somehow it arrivedin GCS we're going to take that and thenwe're going to send it to docs AI sothis is what the claim form looks likeyou can see it has a name address someidentifiers it's got an invoice numberhere with this invoice that's attachedit ends in 342 let's remember that forlater and then there areum you can see the the total amount was500 dollarsso now we're gonnaum run through the process this is theGCS bucket that we're going toeventually drop it intoand now we're going to switch over toapplication integration and you can seethis drag and drop experience that I'vebeen talking aboutso at the top you see the documenttrigger this is actually a pub subtrigger that notifies us that thedocument arrives we go to the GCSconnector and we download the file fromGCS then we call out to docs Ai and wedo what's called a classification we'rewanting to check to make sure this isreally a medical invoiceum if it is we make a decision and saywe're going to process that if it's notwe send someone an email and say we gotsome file that does not look like aclaim rightso now we're gonna once it's um decidedthat it's a proper claim we're going tosend it to docs AI to get it digitizedso docs AI is going to scan that in itactually returns to me this huge Jsonpayload with all the data that it hasscanned in from the PDF I use my datamapper to pull data out of that one ofthe things I look for is the amount andif the amount's greater than a thousanddollars I'm going to go to a manualapproval if it's less than a thousanddollars I'm going to just assume it'sAuto approvedthat's going to go to Salesforce if itgoes on the approval path and if it'snot on the approval path we're going tonotify someone but we're we're going toregardless of whether it's approved ornot we're going to insert it intobigquery so we can do analytics on thatlaterokay so that's kind of the overall flowof the process you can see this is veryeasy to just kind of read through andsee what's happeningnow we're going to go to GCS and we'regoing to upload that file into GCSso thismember43.pdf has the contents that thatwe saw earlier with the medical claimformokay that's been uploaded nowum that's going to send a notificationto Pub sub that a new file was createdin GCSthat's going to set off our Pub subtrigger that you see at the topand now what we're going to do is lookin the logs you can see that there'smany instances of this integration thathave run we're going to drill into thisfirst one which is at the top which isthe latest one that ran and you can seeevery processing step that's happened wecould also drill into one of these stepsand we can see all the variables and thevalues of those variables as they wereset which is very handy for debuggingnow we're switching over to Salesforceand we're going to refresh the screenand we can see that this new claim forPrince Charles showed upyou can see that the address was pickedup the invoice total the invoice amountumas well as the invoice number endingwith 342 and then if we go to bigquerywe can see that it also showed up inbigqueryso we went from dragging and dropping onthe screen to being able to run this injust a few minutesone other thing I want to show you isjust some of the options that areavailable to you with our triggers andtasks so you can see hereyep good you're seeing it on the screenI have an API trigger I have a pub subtrigger a scheduling trigger Salesforcezendesk jira Cloud Etcall of these are available to start yourflowthese are some of the tasks that areavailable you remember we talked aboutthe Google connectors you can see wehave a whole category of artificialintelligence connectors herewe haveumdata manipulation so we can do datamapping data transformation via scriptsas well as a JavaScript task where youcan drop into codewe can also call apps script or anygeneric public rest endpoint can becalled here from this rest taskthere's connectors this is how we accessall of our connectorsthere's some preview features here aswell you can call workflowsum there's approval uh tests we saw thatthat approval task earlier that willactually suspend the process and waitfor a human being to come and approvethatthese are the advanced constructs thatwe talked about like for each for eachparallel while loop so there's severaldifferent ways that you can do loopingsome workspace connectors for drive andsheetssecurity Cloud KMS secret managerfirestore data flow and you can also doa return test this is part of our errorhandling where you can set the HTTPResponse Code if you want to return anerror to your clientokay with that I am going to invite mycolleague promode to come upand promote is going to share someexciting news about some new featuresthat we're working on that are comingsoonthank you Scott I'm usually don't need amic but it's 4 45 or 5 o'clock on asecond day of a conference so we're alltiredum we you have come all the way toattend this conference it will be notfair on meto talk about what's next right like yousaw how cool it was to go and drag anddrop integrate and automate yourbusiness process connect your systems inmatter of minutes now let's take it andlevel it up one more right this is wherethe power of Jane AI comes up right sowhat we are going to uh what this iswhat you will be able to see as part ofthe trusted tester program which we arelaunching let's see how it is going tochange uh how Integrations are beingbuilt you should be able to go out andbuild what Scott showed you in the demoby just using a prompt which means thatyou don't need to actually know all thetools all the navigations required youcould actually go and say oh I need togo and process this midi claim and itshould be able to go out and generatethe actualorchestration or the automation flowjust from the productuh that's pretty simple but that's notthe actual differentiator or that's notthe mode the mode is how it is contextaware you would have seen in Thomaskeynote yesterday how important thecontext was it actually can understandyour Enterprise schemas your Enterpriseapis your apps your systems like forexample if you useum Salesforce it luckily only promptedSalesforce instead of prompting you toHubSpot as a CRM so it is actually gonnago build a flow not like any genericwhat you'll get from chat GPT but it isactually context I've had to go out andtell you that this is what is needed toget work done within your Enterpriseokay so you got your flow you got thedifferentiator with respect to havingEnterprise context it's just not that itis not always that you interact with GenAI through prompts it becomes likeunnatural although it's through naturallanguage it is about how AI proactivelyhelps you in getting your tasks donelike how many of you as integrationspecialists hate to write test casesright like imagine the test cases is soimportant to ensure that there isconsistency when you move from oneversion to another all of that thanks toGene AI is automated which means that wecould actually go and create test casessave you bunch of time automatically byjust using Jai okay this is good uh whatI'm going to do this is given that I ambetween you and drinks I'm going toactually show you this through a demoand for the demo I'm gonna use afixtures company here except it's not acocktail company it's a coffee companyso I assume that it's a Cloud9 CoffeeBean Company it's a boutique shop inSeattle who have been running now theyare expanding Beyond Seattle to otherregions they are under growing a digitaltransformation which involves apis andautomation all of that that's what I'mgonna use as the scenario to show youthe demo and here Emma Emma is the inintegration specialist who has beentasked to actually automate your ordermanagement process like for example theorder comes in the Coffee Bean has toprocess that order to actually go outand send that to shipment right liketypical Boutique coffee shops whichactually operate that's what I'mactually going to go ahead and show youdemo now of how gen AI is actually goingto go on and help you build what thisEmma wants to achieve hereum let me switchokay so what you see on the screen iswhat is uh called as API Hub it's acatalog of apis so one of the apis whichCloud9 has already built is the purchaseorder API okay so it's an API whichactually accepts order incoming and ithas to go out and connect and integrateinto their backend system to actually goout and place an order all of thatthat's what I'm going to use gen AI toactually help me automate thatparticular process but what I amstarting with is is actually an APIwhich is available here so I'm gonna goand click on Integrations I'm going togo ahead and sorrylive stuffjust give me a secondokay thank you uh so I'm actuallyclicked on a build Integrations what itactually told me is it listed all theoperations which I won't actually startbuilding like I'm going to choose here acreate a new purchase order and I'm alsogoing to go out and give a prompt pleasepay attention to the prompt here that'sthe power of llm I'm going to sayautomate accepting orders using anincoming PDF okay that's what I said andthe llm actually can understand what theprompt is and will be able to go andgenerate when I click on confirmit actually takes you to the automationflow which you saw with Scott but fewthings before we go to the flow itselfwhat it did number one it was able toautomatically generate the name of theintegration because it knew that you arestarting from a purchase order API so itsaid okay create order automation iswhat it did that's not cool but what italso did is it automatically got in allthe variables and the schemas from theAPI into your integration which meansthat it's consistent it's not like it'susing the same schema same variablessame Fields inside the thought you willactually see here so I'm going to go andaccept the name here and I'm going tosay it looks good and you could see thatit got in the purchase order object itgot the order output all of that thislooks great before that you could seethat uh llm gen AI was able to generatethe automation flow few things to notehere I just said incoming PDF okay usingthe PDF word it was able to understandoh if it's a PDF it needs to bedigitized it has to be extracted it hasto be orchestrated that's what isactually gonna it automatically placed adoc AI which is what you saw in Scott'sdemo okay not not just that it was alsoable to go out and suggest to me whichapplication which I need to go andconnect to because it found an orderobject inside sapokay so it was actually good andintelligent to go out and read yourexisting connections this is where theEnterprise context comes into pictureone of the key things which stands outis the last but one step which you seethere which is around shipping detailsor calculating the delivery date I nevermentioned calculate the delivery date inmy prom but calculate delivery date isan Enterprise API within your Enterpriseand it also had an ability to take inorder object as an input and calculatethe delivery date or the shipmentdetails and it automatically suggestedoh this may be involved in yourautomated order processing there and itwas able to summarize what it gotgenerated and I could actually lookthrough other options all of it in thiscase I'm going to go and say okay greatconfirm cool it got accepted right so Icould actually go and see the processthis is the most common problem ofgetting started like you I did not needto know the tool and what this helps isthink about democratizing automationwithin your Enterprise which means thatyou don't need Specialists you don'tneed people with specialist knowledge ofthe tools and the systems to actually goand build integration you could actuallyhave people build integration with thehelp of generic in this case what I'mgoing to do next is I'm going to go andshow you what it did it just not did notjust suggest sap it also configured sapconnection for me because it was alreadythere it was able to go out and fetch inall the uh connectors as you could seethe entityif you pay attention to the entitybecause purchase order was the entity itthat's how it actually generated andwith the mapping for me great uh but Iam not satisfied because llm is asaccurate as as it could be it hulsonatesso I wantas I said it's not always throughprompts right the AI has to be embeddedinto your experience so in this case I'mgoing to ask llm for suggestions okaytell me what I should be replacing thiswith because sap is not correct so Icould actually ask Jane AI looking forsuggestions it actually goes through therefinement process with your Enterprisecontext and says oh I do see a couple ofmore Connections in this case as youcould see Salesforce is a CRM but it'sstill suggesting Salesforce as a thingbecause of how llm is but I'm gonna usenetsuite as my Erp here so I'm going togo out and soon it's sweet itautomatically configured the connectionswhich is required for doing netsuite asyou could see here it's netsuiteconnections and all of that great thisis good what next talking aboutembedding a experience I'm going to goout and look at thedata mapping if you have usedIntegrations tools you know the biggestpain point in doing any integration orautomation is actually mapping okay it'sthe heavy lifting job of actuallymapping your Source uh to the Target buthere in this case Jane AI was able toautomatically create a mapping for meokay but as you could see it was it dida mapping between order created to theorder output which is basically theorder created was the object coming infrom netsuite and it actually mapped tothe order output which was the APIresponse back great but it didn't missout certain things here for example itnever included the shipment details andall of that okay so this is where Icould actually take the help of gen AIhere when I I'm gonna go out and ask itokay help me add more things into mymapping it could be through a prompt orit could be as simple as you could copypaste your input output object like youhave an input you have an output copypaste it it will do the mapping for youthat's the power of llm which you willbe able to experience as part of thistrusted tester program which isavailable so I'm going to go ahead andput in a prompt it's a complex promptokay and this is what we tested it saysmapped delivery dates from shipmentdetails object into the order output butalso most importantlycalculate the total order value from theline items of the object right I nevermentioned the order typically has lineitems price and quantity right and Iwant to calculate the total order valueof the order being placed and I justgave it a prompt what it was able to doit was it was actually able to go andnot just generate the flow which I canconfirm but I will show you that it wasable to do the functions required aswell so what I'm going to do is if youlook at this functionit actually was able to go out and saythat item into product Enterprise I3through an array calculate the totalorder value okay imagine if we have todo it whatever be the language whateverbe the function it could be pre-builtsolutionuhso exhibitionokay okay so uh think about uh thiscomplex function whatever knowledge youhave you have to learn the code it couldbe in Python it could be go all of itbut automatically Janae was able to goand help it with doing the mapping soone final thing before uh so this isgood with respect tomapping but it's not only our own flowgeneration I could actually ask it to goout and help me with updating the flowin this case I want to actually go outand give a prompt to say that send me anemail if the order quantity is more than100 to the stocking Department rightthat's what it did it generated aadditional flow automatically for mewhich means that I could keep workingwith llm ass and when needed I couldtake its help it's not one time it ispart of your experience which isembedded okay this is all coolone last thing which we saw a couple oflast things rather one thing is our owntest we talked about test here you couldsee llm was proactive I did not doanything llm was able to go and identifyoh I am at a stage where I couldactually go and generate test cases foryour automation right so I'm actuallygonna go and click on this and itautomatically created test cases for mehere I could see that it created like itwas like it created an order creationsuccess it created order duplicate thatzero quantity you could ask it to createmore all of that right soum next is I'm just forwarding one morestep the last one is uh how many of youwe talked about testingevery one of us hate documentation rightwhich that's the last thing or we neverdocument the documentation is poor sohow do we actually help you all go andcreate documentation Janai is able to goout and help you with actually creatingdocumentation it's a similar experiencewhat you'd have been used to thinkGoogle Docs it generates a full detaileddescription you could actually go outand use it all out of the controls to goand say okay I need to Bullet it says Iwant to formalize it I'm in this caseI'm going to click on shorten and it wasable to go out and reduce it looks goodI could actually go ahead and addanything I'm going to go ahead and sayinsert and SaverightThat's The Power of DNA now imagine thisis the work which you do day in and dayout how it was able to accelerate fromcreating base flow it was creatingdocumentation creating integration mostimportantly with your Enterprise contextright like it is not randomly sayinghallucinating rather it is picking upyour interface apis your applicationsyour assistance your connections all ofthat put together so with that concludeswhat use what's next you will be able tosign up for all of these as part of thetrusted tester program so that you couldgive us feedback whether it is workingfor you and The Trusted tester programis open right now you could go out andsign up with that I will actuallywelcome our partner of the YearAccenture to talk about a customer Storyhow one of the customers down under uhleveraged Accenture to actually do adigital transformation using applicationintegration so thank youhow do I switchall right thanks pramod and welcomeeveryone to our session today Iappreciate it has been a long day so I'mgonna make this one short and to thepointtoday I'm gonna be talking about one ofour success stories at accentureddelivering a cloud transformationprogram for one of our clients based outof AustraliaI'm also going to shed the light on acouple of use cases integration usecases what were the tools that we'veused and whyumyeah firstly uhI want to emphasize on how highly wevalue the relationship with Google andhow highly we invest in it and we are sograteful for the award that we've gotfrom Google over the course of the yearsand the most recent one yesterday beingthe Global Services partner of the yearand uh I think there was another threeother awards that we've earned so thanksGoogle and thanks Accenture forinvesting in thousands of professionalsand certifications on Google Cloudour client for today is Landis there areGlobal real estate organization valuedat nearly six billion dollars they areheadquartered in Australia Sydney butthey are operating in several parts ofthe world and I'm sure some of theprojects on the screen right now mightsound familiar to many of the peoplehere right nowwe have been in business for more than60 years and they are managing funds andassets that worth several billions ofdollarsso let's talk more about the cloudtransformation program and how did lifelook like at lendlies prior to thetransformationthey were running most of theirworkloads on premise in four differentdata centers across two differentcontinentslots of their business apps were siledslowing down respond to business theyhad lots of Legacy technologies thatwere slowing down the pace of change andholding them back from innovationand moreover they were also having beingon premise they had relativelyless ability to scale but with GoogleCloud they have been able to baconscalability into their infrastructurethey got access to more Cloud native andmodern technologies that helped themaccelerate Innovation they have alsolaunched some digital arm called PodiumI encourage you if you are in the realestate business to have a look at themand follow themthey have also got access to Modernintegration tools that help them breakthe silos between business apps andmoreover they have increased bothfinancial and environmentalsustainability and I'm so proud of thelater by the wayall rightum overall value realized by by lendliesfor that cloud transformation program158 apps move to the cloud 17 decreasein the cloud decrease in the overall itecost50 percentdecrease in the carbon emissions for theworkloads running on the cloud versusthose workloads we're running on premiseand they have very ambitious by the waythey have very ambitious plans forsustainability and an overall decreaseinum the I.T integration platformwe can keep talking about the valuerealization but I think we are here formainly the integration so I'm gonnafocus on the integration use cases thefirst one was more around the data Lakeintegration and lendlies have chosenGoogle bigquery to be their platform forum their big lake they were looking forintegrating data from multiple sourcesinto bigquery do the necessarytransformation for the differentconsumption machine learningvisualizationum actionable insights Etcso we've that for that we've used Googledata flow because of its native supportfor bigquery scalable can scale up anddown with your workloads managed youdon't have to manage the underlyinginfrastructureand if you are the CTO CIO head ofengineering you will love it you investfor only in only one skill for your teamand you unlock lots of capabilities foryour organization managingstructured unstructured batch andstreaming stream data processing I loveit personallythe Second Use case was aroundapplication to application integrationor application to applicationcommunication and in that case I'm gonnatalk about a specific example at Landisat lendlies they have a platform thatacts as a source of Truth for projectinformation and decision makingas you might imagine that's very crucialand important for a real estateorganizationall other parts in the business areinterested in the information about theprojects and decisions made Etcso for that we used Google applicationintegration together with other Googlecloud services to bet to build anend-to-end solution to capture thechanges in the source system as theyoccur and make it available for theother interested platformsand doing all the necessarytransformation whether to push itto push it out to the interestedplatform or to make it available for theother platform to come in and pull forconsumptionwe use Google application integrationbecause it's simply managed as a serviceit can scale up and down and again ithad all the connectors we needed for allour use casesI'm gonna share some of the bestpractices we learned along the way usingGoogle application integration andpromise that would be the last slidefirst manage complexity make surewhenever you're using Google applicationintegration is not to build highlycomplex integration break it down intosmaller one and reusable wheneverapplicablesecond maximize the value and I thinkyou have already seen in the demos howhow big is the value you get when youcombine Google application integrationwith other Google cloud servicesdon't underestimate that valuethe last one pops up is going to be yourfriend if you're if you're using Googleapplication integration pops up is goingto be your friend use it to glue allyour application integration togethermake the most use out of the pub subfunctions uh and features like Cloudfunction triggeringummessage ordering and dead letter topicsEtcwith that my part comes to an end[Music]foreign"
