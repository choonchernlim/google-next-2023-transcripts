    "transcript": "[Music]morning good morning everyone and uhwelcome to day two of Google Cloud nextmy name is elen Amana I'm the globalstartup and SMB director here at GoogleCloud I am really excited really excitedto be here on stage because I am goingto moderate a panel between Amit zavivice president general manager and headof platform at Google cloud and ChrisValenzuela who is a co-founder and CEOof Runway and uh for those who don'tknow about Runway Runway is a AI um datasorry is a AI research company shapingthe era ofart human creativity andentertainment so I think that is a bigVision so you are in for atrat so let'sstart Chris we announced a strategicpartnership with Runway and Google Cloudum just recently could you tell us moreabout it and how Runway is using GoogleCloudnookay improvising thank you yes um umwell actually that's a good metaphor tostart with the with the with the GPU andthe cloud capacity and how we guys areworking with you um so yeah reallyexcited to to announce our partnershipwith gcp on on our compute side ofthings and our research side of thingsif you not on what we do we are researchcompany that's been doing some uh workaround video and image generation andalso just multimodel Generation Um andwe've been doing this for the last fiveyears or so so definitely in being knowat some for some time and one of themost critical things that uh we'refinding ourselves uh now is um makingsure that we can continue training largelarge models in the way that we done itand so really ramping up aninfrastructure that has never been donebefore built before is really reallyreally critical um and the same way wehave millions of users so deploying tothose millions of users in a real-timebasis becomes really important and sohaving the support of of you guys of gcpof having that resource and thatcapacity and that like Cloudinfrastructure has been critical for usto do both training of models but alsodeploying and and infer so excited tocontinue scaling thatwonderfulAmit yesterday during thekeynote yes there were a lot ofannouncements yes from infrastructure todata to AI when you think about allthese announcements and you think of ourstartup agents which one do you thinkare the most relevant to them no I thinkuh overall what you see in the last 8 nmonths huge amount of new capabilitiesbeen added to gcp uh we've beeninvesting aggressive L I think that forthe startup community and our goal fromthe beginning always has been how do youmake it easy for anybody to buildapplications on top of our platform andcould be any kind of application genturns out to be the next big uhrequirements we see for many startupsand we wanted to make sure we provideeasy access a lot of native capabilitiesand an open platform for people toinnovate on it right so some of theannouncements we made uh yesterday uharound say model Garden for exampleright where you can bring any kind ofmodel models out there and as a as adeveloper you can get access to itthrough the same console same look andfeel without having to kind of go backand forth with different differentsystems and learn various differentenvironments to build your applicationso you have a lot of choices that's theone big thing we wanted to make surecomes across uh and uh customers andstartups can use what they feel is bestfor their business as well or for theirapplications uh that I think stands outuh quite a lot uh things we also doingwith Enterprise search uh where we areable to Now find and TR have pre-trainedmodels but now you can now do it veryspecific to your data which you bring infrom your company and keep it local toyou but also now benefit employees andcustomers specific to what the securityrequirements might be so that's anotherarea which we feel very excited aboutbecause that changes the whole way offinding information and then theconversational AI on top of that reallybecomes very very powerful because it'svery very specific to individual versusthe generic kind of a chat bot whichused to be around in the marketplaceplace before right and the third thing Ithink we're doing is also now makingsure our partners and and startups andcustomers can also expose their servicesto Marketplace so we're doing a lot ofwork to bring them on and make it easyfor them to be discovered and make itpart of the Google Cloud kind ofcontracts and everything else so theydon't have to go and build a whole go tomarket motion hire a lot of salese tobuild the business so that's anotherarea which we are Prett pretty excitedabout I like to hear this thank you andChris coming back to you and uh thinkingback to when you started Runway yes youhad a big vision and uh your company hashad tremendous success I actually knowthat you've recently raised 141 millionextension to your CCE which is hugeabsolutely huge could you tell us moreabout when you started your business whydid you have that vision and how hastechnology helped you to get Runway towhere it istoday okay um yeah so it's funny youknow Runway is now five turning fiveyears um but I've been working on runwayfor almost like seven eight years andit's been in my head for like 10 10 umand so that's actually why I move herein the first place just to like spendtime understanding what kind of newcreative um possibilities will enabledum and at the time when we startedbuilding runway in 2015 2016 things arevery different for now I mean none ofthe things that we might consider likestandards and and and and um uh obviousthese days were even like around at thattime and so our vision still is and willcontinue to be for the time um takingmodels Cutting Edge models pushing theboundaries of research um in ways thatcan Empower storytelling and and so youcan think of Runway as a researchcompany that's that's been doingresearch fundamental research for sometime but really think of Runway as astorytelling company we're more closerto creatives and artists and filmmakersand the next generation of filmmakersthan um doing research for the sake ofresearch um and so really what we'veseen over the last I would say couple ofyears has been just an exponentialconsideration of how to deliver thatbecause um 10 years ago the whole ideaand the the concept that you cangenerate video with text if you thinkabout it for a minute like now we mightbe used to it and normalized but fiveyears ago that was like in the realm oflike magic like you're generating amovie and an image with a text prompt umnow it's like oh we just actuallyreleased uh on our new newest model umcamera control so you can generatevideos and kind of like control orDefine the movement of your videos whichis such a specific thing after after thefact that you can again generate videowith words um but again it's um we don'ttend to focus that much on where thingsare um it's more about how fast thingsare progressing and so technology for usis progressing really fast and ourvision continues to be storytelling morethan anything else so when you when youstarted you know and you said it wasabout 10 years ago and you already hadAI in mind but with the purpose um thepurpose clearly around the creativitythe art industry yesand you talked about normalization yesdo you think that this um move and the Caround gener generative AI that we areexperiencing now will normalize at somepoint and if so maybe do you have a timeframe in mind yeah predicting the futureis hard um I think we definitelynormalize it I think you can jump into acab in like New York and the taxi driverwill speak about like image and taxgeneration which is like I thinkastonishing I call that the the momthreat threshold we've crossed thethreshold or my mom finally understandswhat I do because she use it um I thinknormalizing technology becomes reallyimportant in the sense that allows youto be exposed to it understand it like Iagain thinking and and understanding theidea of image generation five years agowas very hard because the the mentalmodels that we have to build around itwere not there yet and only by us beingexposed to it we were understanding thelimitations but also the challengesaround it I think we're entering thatphase asreally starting to understand that thisis transformative this is going to bewidely used in all Industries across theSpectrum and what we do now is tonormalize and to get more people exposedto it and I think that's the the thehistory of major technological likeadoptions is the moment where likecameras for example in the 1800s becamenot only the the realm of scientificinnovation but of artist and that washow Cinema was born and so for us reallyabout something similar is like we wewe've done the research now the time toget this into hands of more people so wecan all start thinking about what's nextthat's amazing thank you I I'll turn toyou and thinking about what Chris itshould be working now yes thinking aboutwhat Chris just said about how AI hasbeen powering hisbusiness with your role at Google cloudand thinking about the way you run yourbusiness your teams the productivity andeverything how have you been thinkingabout applying generative AI to the runthe day today of your bu yeah no I thisa good question in terms of generativeAI I think is changing how we operatecomplet I mean it's pretty much touchesevery part of business now right uh allthe way from of course development we'redoing a lot of things as we you sawyesterday around the doet AI using thatas a CO development tool around adeveloper instead of having them tostart everything from scratch but wealso seeing that in the productivityside as well with what we're doing inthe workspace where you can create a lotof content and the emails and everythingelse but beyond that justun running thebusiness itself is impacting How We Domarketing so a lot of the finding ofinformation on the website uh findingpricing information finding productdetails uh getting kind of understandingof what customers are saying about itcan be easily now done through gen aswell so if you look at what's going tohappen with the cloud.google.com youstart seeing a lot of those things startsurfacing we doing something similar inthe support systems as well like a lotof times customers find it frustratingwhere they can't find the information orcan't search the documentation properlywe have a lot of documentation but itwas never easy to summarize easy to findvery pertinent uh relevant informationto your own individual cases so now weable to tie that through gen createthose uh find you that information andthen kind of connect you to an agent whocan assist you if you can't really getall the help through the documentationor the other uh support data out thereso we see changing there finances samething there's huge amount of uh abilityto understand customer profen to buywhat they're using what kind of otherthings they might be interested how wecan move them along uh we're doing thatin the console as well in the GoogleCloud where we can populate with otherrelevant products to help themunderstand hey if you use these twothree things together you will get thiskind of application built easily we'redoing that with our low code tool aswell where you can now do naturallanguage prompt and create anapplication on the fly without againhaving to write any code so the it'stouching everything over the last yearyear and a half I mean you see everyteam is now adopting genni as part ofthe development uh work but also thebusinesses are now starting to use thatand they sometimes will not realize genright because for them it's a betteroutcome and it doesn't matter how ithappened so it it's starting to becomevery pervasive it becoming kind of corecapabilities just like Cloud had become10 years ago where customers don't carewho's who the infrastructure providerbut I see the value of having it hostedand running in the cloud similarly Ithink gen is going to change a lot ofstuff and there still this is ascratching the surface I expect more andmore Innovative use cases to continue tocome up and and it will touch I thinkevery business and every kind ofapplication as I mean marketing it'salso a a daily um experience in seeinghow in in seeing how can we usegenerative AI in our Marketing in ourcreatives in our processes you know toget closer and better to the customersyes so talking about customers I want tocontinue on the topic of generative AIbut think about its impact on societyand on customers on communities so Ireally like what you said Chris earlierabout your company being researched witha purpose and I know um that you're alsoapplying AI with a purpose so there arelots of conversation about thecollaboration yes or co- collaborationbetween humans and Ai and I know yourbusiness is doing quite a lot with thatso can you tell us a bit more yeahdefinitely um it's something I've beenwe've been thinking a lot lately as asmodel have gotten even more mainstreamum I think that it's again it's hard topredict the future but I think goingback to the past can always help usinform I think um how this future mightshape um I think history doesn't repeatbut it often Rhymes that's think that'sa that's a common saying so um if youlook back at like for example theinvention of the camera um 150 years agoum really the the most and the mostpositive outcomes happen from um thathuman artifact collaboration right um atthe time a lot of people thoughtphotography was an to end art and thatpainting will disappear and that wewouldn't need artist anymore because youjust press a button and you're done andthe truth is that as we all know thatdidn't happen art didn't died on thecontrary art was augmented art waschanged and painting was actually veryinfluenced by photography andphotography was influenced by paintingand Cinema was influencing all of it Ithink this is somehow very similar whereit's it's not really an obsession thatwe should have around models themselveslike models should s a purpose um shouldhave a business purpose uh creativepurpose and technology has always beenin the function of like people and sowhen you start flipping that um youstart asking different questions whichis well how are you going to use it howcontrollable how flexible for what Ithink what we seen right now is um a lotof interest in the models themselvesbecause the technology is so new just soradically different from anything we'veseen in the past but at some point Ireally hope we'll get to this point verysoon you we will all collectively stopreferring to Ai and we just refer to itas the infrastructure of the world it'swhat we do when when we speak aboutdoing a wire transfer and transferringfunds between two banks no one says I'mgoing to log into the internet so I cantransfer ones via the Internet and a webbrowser right you just you just say itand everyone knows this is going to bevery similar I'm going to make a movieand you know you're probably going to beusing a lot of like AI but you don'thave to specify because it's just partof your kind of like arsenal of toolsand so I think I'm looking forward tothe moment where we're going to stopreferring to it as AI tools and AIgenerated and just as tools like anyothertool I'll turn the same question to Amitand thinking about Google stands on aresponsible AI yes can you share a bitmore with the audience what we mean bythat and how we bring that to life inpractice Yeah I think what I appreciateGoogle uh for sure is that we're verythoughtful about what we should be doingwith AI right uh we put in a lot ofeffort and thinking behind how we exposesome of this very powerful technologyand make sure it's usable and useful tothe humankind instead of being justavailable there and kind of can create alot of other issues so we have very welldefined principles in terms of what AIcan be used for and we've been prettyopen about it for many years so AI isnot new for Google I mean Google hasbeen investing in this space for manymany years and we know what the power itbrings and the issues it can create ifit's not used properly so with theresponsible AI I think you heard fromSund yesterday for example and you seethat on a regular basis uh we want tomake sure and uh how that is who can useit how they can use it what kind ofapplications can be built what kind ofdata can be exposed uh making sure noneof the malicious stuff can be used outof it and exposed to and users andcreate proper problem in the society sowe continue to kind of make sure theprinciples we've defined are beendelivered and we adhere to it uh there'sa lot of this push to productizeeverything very quickly uh there's ahuge amount of pressure in the market tosay hey if you have all these things andlook at other vendors how why why are isnot offering all the things instantlyand we can we have a lot of goodproducts but I think there is real regrules and conditions we put in thedevelopment teams as well inside Googleto make sure they're thoughtful at theapproach uh they put in and we'llcontinue to make sure that uh it is aresponsible way for usage and then wewill partner with the community and makesure that we can take advantage of thisbut also prevent any kind of wrong usageout ofit thank you am and uh still on theimpact on society um Chris I know thatfriendway takes existing technologiesthat are you know common in the datascience and engineering world and putthem at the center of more creative youknow environment and that has bigimplications yes um in the Creatoreconomy so how are you opening up um tothe communities this P for um I thinksimilar to to to the last point I onopening the communities and beingresponsible I think as model Buildersand researchers in the space we have aresponsibility to make sure that thisgets not not only into the hands of umuh the research community and theengineering community but also theartistic commun community and sometimesthose worlds don't Collide or don'tmerge as much as we would like to uhbecause incentives might be differentbecause exposure to technology isdifferent and so it really takes afurther step for us to go there um as atechnology company uh an example of thiswe have two programs that are a greatrepresentation of how we can cross theline between um and stri a greatconnection between Art and Science umwe've we've hosted uh an AI filmfestival in New York and in ASFand that's a celebration of filmmakersum doing films with AI and but the keything is that we're not highlighting themodels technology we're highlighting andcelebrating the people behind it and sothere's no discussion around large modeltraining and um inference or deploymentsthis is a conversation around look atthe movie it's just great tell us moreabout it we're actually by the way ifyou're interested we're organizing uhversion second version of the filmfestival it's going to happen now in LAand New York we have thousands ofsubmissions a well-known panel we had umdaroski com in last time and speak abouthow this creative processes beingaugmented with AI um and so that's oneof the examples and the other one is uhwe have a division inside Runway calledRunway Studios um which HS purposes theentire purpose of that team is toproduce and help creatives use this newkind of camera so think about it as thisAI is a new kind of camera and not onlythe camera manufacturers need to like beable to use it but everyone else whowants to tell a story should be able toknow how to use the camera and sotraining and improving and customizingthe camera um going into film schoolsand design schools to teach it goinginto like all over the world I'm I'mfrom Chile and I would have loved tostudy film early on I never had accessto a camera or like a film school sothis is for me like the dream i' I'vealways had in my head and so we're alsodoing that going to like multiple placesin the world and giving this camera tomorepeople thankyou when I look at thewe have small businesses largeEnterprises startups at different stagesyes of development and usually whenyou're in the business world or you wantto start a business you know you asklots of advice you read lots of books umadvice from investors advice top 10 tipsto to start so Amit is also an angelinvestor yes and you're aFounder how could you help this audencewhether it's top 10 tips um pitfalls toavoid what would you share with theaudience starting with You Chris so wehave like two hoursright um well that's a hard one um so mybelief after like I mean maybe I meanyou want to share more of yourexperience as an angel investor but I Itruly believe that the best way to doanything and to like learn how to doanything is just to do it like you canread a lot of books and you can read alot of like recipes and tips and tricksbut nothing nothing nothing will likesurpass the fact of just doing it evenif you fail even if you don't like if itdoesn't work that you're going to learnso much about just doing it or trying todo it um and so that was kind of like myassumption with like funding a companyand starting a fundraising which is I'venever done it so I'm going to do it I'mgoing to fail the first time but thenI'm going to do it again and I was likeoh I've learned something and then youdid like a thousand times you're likeyeah you're you can you can learn moreand so um yeah not necessarily like afan of like tips or recipes more of afun of like just figure it out just goand like it's gonna if you are scarthat's great like the fact that you'rescared about it means that there'ssomething there yeah I don't know if youtrial try and error and resilienceexactly yes perfect no I think it's aimportant point the resiliency part isdefinitely important becausethe founders I mean usually the ones Iinvest in I always look at the foundersand the team the core team and howwilling they are to kind of work hardbut also be able to kind of understandchanges and be able to continue evolvingthey cannot come with one fixed mind andsay this is it I don't care what thecustomers say or anything like that sothe founding team with a good technicalknowledge and the ability to kind ofcontinue pushing the envelope andworking and be aggressive about gettingit done right I think you you have tohave that kind of feel for it otherwiseit's very hard to be a I mean I I'm Ihave done one startup and I would neverdo it again uh but uh there are peoplewho are very good at it and uh you knowwhen you meet them that they will workand get it done right and you can figureout the interest and the depth they haveby having a lot of those conversationsright so as a startup when you thinkingabout you better have some interest inthat area willing to kind of learn frommultiple conversations and continuenetworking and building that uh depth inthe area so that you can be outinnovating anybody else and and reallysolving a problem that everybody wantsto pay you for right the other thing Ialways try to look at when I look atstartups is that do they havemonetization way right are they going tomake money A lot of times there a lot ofgreat ideas but if you're not going tobe able to now uh really have somebodywilling to pay for it that's really agood test like somebody's is somebodywilling to pay for what you build uh andif they are that means there is abusiness to be had and then it becomesmore of like how you really build theright product and then scale and that'sall execution after that so executionmindset with the idea of what what thewhat the needs are and be willing tokind of be resilient as you pointedout"
