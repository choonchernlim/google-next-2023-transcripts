bigqueryjoining me today is Rupa Gupta who's thechief technology officer of a veryesteemed partner habooin this session we'll talk about how youcan use data clean rooms to share datasecurelyand in a privacy-centric waybefore I dive into clean rooms I want totake an opportunity to recognize some ofthe trends and also opportunities thatwe're seeing within the whole dataecosystem and data sharing spacethere is no doubt that data is thedriving force for Innovation and growthfor organizationsfor many years you've seen customersleverage their internal data andoperational data to generate insightsbut what we're seeing more recently isthat more and more organizations aresharing data and combining data withexternal resources to generate newinsightsyou know for example retailers areworking with media platforms to learnabout their customer preferenceswe also see that manufacturers areworking with suppliers to optimize theirsupply chainso there's a lot of use cases whereleveraging external data leads to higherlevels of innovation there are manystudies that show that as welland we actuallyGoogle Cloud customers that use bigqueryshare data we saw that there arethousands of organizations sharing over350 petabytes of data acrossorganizational boundaries per weekthat is incredible and we've seen thisnumber grow by almost 40 percent in justsince last Novemberone of the reasons that December isgrowing is because of a new service thatwe announced and launched last year inGA which is analytics sub uh for thosethat don't know analytics sub is aservice a featured in part of bigquerywhich is our data exchange and datasharing platform that allows dataproviders to publish their data and makeit available and data subscribers todiscover and find third-party datasources and use that for their analysisin fact in just one year we've seenhundreds of organizations use analyticssub and a lot of these data providershave brought their data sets intobigquery and made it available forcustomers so we thank you for all thepartners that brought your data tobigquery and made it available for manydata analysts to find Reliable datasources and valuable data and use itwithin their analysisdespite the growth and data sharing oneof the things that is on top of mind formany organizations is privacy andcompliancenow more than ever your customersunderstand are unaware of how their datais being used and they expect to havetransparency on how that data is beingused for any analysis or anything that'sbeen sharedand at the same time we've seengovernments across the world Implementand enforce privacy restrictions andregulationsyou see gdpr and CCPA are examples ofwhere there's more scrutiny towards howdata can be shared and of course if youdo share it without abiding by thoserules there are a lot of Hefty fines youneed to faceand particularly for those that areworking in the ad Tech and mediabusinesswe see that the traditional ways ofindividual and device identifiers arealso going awayso these companies are looking for newways to get the same level of insightsthat they used to previously with thenew technology or platformthat's where data clean rooms come intopictureso earlier this year we announced dataclean rooms and the goal with datacleaners was to address some of thechallenges that we've seen with privacyand compliance when it comes to sharingdatawith data clean rooms and bigquery dataclean rooms our goal is to enablecustomers to create a securecollaboration environment where they canshare combine and analyze data withoutcompromising on privacywhat does this really mean for you so ifyou are a media publisher you can builda clean room with your advertisers toimprove your advertisingif you are a financial institution andyou want to improve your fraud detectionyou can build a cleaner with some of theother institutions and share data andprivacy and secure wayand also if you're in healthcarehospitals and pharmaceuticals can cometogether and share data in a clean roomto identify how treatments are beingused with various patientsand the great thing about bigquery cleanrooms is that you can do all thiswithout having to move or copy your dataso I mentioned before we announcedbigquery clean rooms earlier this yearand I have a very special announcementwe're actually launching bigquery dataclean rooms into public preview today[Applause]so now you can go into your bigqueryconsole and go create your clean roomand let me actually dive into some ofthe capabilities that we're launchingso the first thing that we're doing isthat we want to make it easy for you tocreate and deploy clean rooms for youruse casesso starting off we have a seamless UIand workflow in bigquery where you canorchestrate a cleaneryou can create a cleaner environment tosecure invite your partners tocollaborate with you within the cleanroom and also set permissions on who cancontribute data and who can subscribe toitwe also have we realize that when you'reworking with clean rooms it's usually amulti-party collaboration so we don'thave any restrictions on how manyparties you can invite to a clean roomand how manytables or data sets you can join so wecall that anime collaborationwe also see that you know not all ofyour partners that you invite to a cleanroom might be part of Google cloud andyou might have partners that are sittingon some of our friends on the other sidefor different Cloud providers so we haveIntegrations with bigquery Omni thatallow you to Federate and connect todata that is not in Google Cloud as welland lastly any data that's shared withinthe clean room cannot be copied oregressed so we have data egressrestrictions in place so if you makeyour data available in a clean room noneof the subscribers that are runningqueries against it can copy or removethe underlying dataand everything that you see here can bedone programmatically through apis so ifyou're a partner which you'll hear fromvery soon you can build on top ofbigquery data clean rooms or if you wantto do this at scale for multiple usecases you can use the apisokay so now you know how to create anddeploy clean rooms the next step is fora data contributor you need to make surethat any data that's shared in the cleanroom has the right type of Protectionsin place to make sure there's nosensitive information being sharedwhich is why we have analysis rulesanalysis rules essentiallymake it easier for you to determine as adata contributor how data can beanalyzed and what are the restrictionsthat you're putting in place for someonethat's running a query against this datain a clean roomso we're starting off with a coreanalysis rule which is aggregation soany data that you shared in a clean roomyou can create an aggregation privacypolicy that essentially provides you theability to select a privacy unit columnand the threshold so there's a minimumnumber of distinct entities when you'rerunning a query against this data andmaking it availablewe also realize there's a lot of otheruse cases as well for clean rooms so ona roadmap we have overlap analysis sothis is really useful again if you'redoing uh retargeting for audiences oryou know more of the core use caseswhere you're trying to compare theoverlap between two different data setsso you'll have overlap restrictionsyou'll also have the ability to use moreAdvanced Techniques like differentialprivacy which is the key for anonymizingyour datayou also have restrictions where you canprevent someone from joining to acertain column that's being shared in acleaner for a tableso all these great functionalities arebuilt into created clean rooms so youcan use SQL and also some of theworkflows directly in the UI toconfigure itall right so now you can create acleaner and deploy it as a datacontributor you can make sure that youhave the right Protections in place whenyou make your data availableso the next step is for you to monitorthis so you heard from Married customersthat it's important for someone that'smaking data available within a cleanroom that they can track who's using thedata and also monitor the usageso bigquery data clean rooms is built ontop of analytics sub so you getsubscriptions and some of the built-infunctionality where you can see who'ssubscribing to your clean room and youcan revoke access at any time and youcan also use usage metrics which givesyou information about what types ofqueries are being run against this dataso you'll find information on which youknow it's table which column is beingcreated frequently and how customers areactually using that informationall right so now you can create yourclean rooms you can set analysis rulesand you can track and monitor thisoften a lot of customers come to us andsay great this is useful for my use casebut what about Google datawell if you don't know we actually havea clean room that we launched back in2017 for Google ads and Google campaignevents and this is called ads data hubin fact Google was the first company tobring to Market I did a clean roomsolution but as data for marketerswe recognize that many of you might beleveraging that to get insights and whatyou would like to do is also use adsdata in conjunction with the clean roomsthat you're creating and using inbigqueryso which is why we are going tointegrate and connect with ads data Hubdirectly in bigquery so we have comingup as part of our GA is that you will beable to connect to ads data hubhave your first party data withinbigquery and run queries directly in thebigquery console against Google campaigndataall right so we talked about how you canuse bigquery data clean rooms to createand deploy set analysis rules and yougot a little bit of glimpse of how youcan track usage and also what's comingup in our roadmapand I've used the word bigquery a fewtimes and those of you that are notfamiliar with bigquery I want to giveyou a little bit of insight into why wechose to build data clean rooms on topof the bigquery platformso one of the unique things of howbigquery is built is its architecture itseparates out storage and compute andthis is really important as someone thatis creating a cleaner and deploying thisbecause as someone who's contributingdata the only cost that you would incurwhen you make data available in theclean room is storageand for someone that is running analysisor running queries against data in aclean room the only cost you to incurare the queries and bigquery gives youthe ability to separate those two thingsout so again you can scale and the wholepoint is that you're not moving the datafrom words in placealso bigquery has a lot of nativeIntegrations we start with you know Ihaven't used the word AI since about 12minutes into the presentation but weknow it's important for not only for youto be able to create analysis andqueries but also build models on top ofdata that you're sharing so bigquery hasbuilt-in bigquery ml where you can buildand operationalize models directly inSQL so it's easy for you to analyze yourdata and build models on top of it andshare it out to your analystsat the same time we realize that a lotof the end users that are consuminginsights about data that's madeavailable in the clean room are oftenlooking at reporting they're not cominginto bigquery and running SQLwhich is why bigquery makes it easy foryou to integrate with many of the otherbi platforms such as looker for you tobe able to visualize some of theinsights that you're getting out of acleanerso once you create and deploy your cleanrooms set your analysis rules runqueries you can build reporting that'svery rich for your end users andbusiness users so they can visualizethat information again they don't haveto use queries or run an analysis inbigquery they can see everythingdirectly in the bi reporting toolso not only are you getting access toall these rich capabilities in bigqueryyou essentially have access to theentire Google's data and AI Suiteso we bigquery you probably saw in someof the earlier sessions has Integrationswith vertex AI and we're doing a lot ofwork to make sure thatdevelopers and data Engineers that areworking across these different productshave seamless Integrations and againwith bigquery data clean rooms you'll beable to leverage these capabilitiesdirectly in bigquery again withouthaving to to move your data out orneeding any other new infrastructure oranother platform so everything is builtin and it's nativeall right so you learned a little bitabout how bigquery data clean rooms workand some of its capabilities let me giveyou a good example of how customers areleveraging bigquery clean rooms and whata typical architecture might look likefor youso imagine that you are a retailerthat's collaborating with a cpg and thisis very common you can also think abouta media publisher collaborating with anAdvertiserso retailer has information on some ofthe sales transactions POS data theyhave information on you know who visitedthe storeEtcwhereas the cpg has information on thecampaigns that they've run for theirbrand or product for these customerstypically a cpg would like to know youknow what is the ROI that they'regetting for the campaigns that they'rerunningfor with this particular retailer andhow many conversions have they hadso what they would do is they wouldagree to collaborate in a clean roomenvironment so they're sharing data in asecure collaboration environment withinthe cleanerand the process for them to do thatwithin bigquery is as followsso the first thing you would do is gointo analytics sub similar to how youwould create secure data exchanges yougo create a cleaner so in this caseimagine the retail is creating a retailmedia cleanerThe Next Step because it's the retailerthat's making and creating this cleaneris for the retailer to make their dataavailable so in their bigquery projectthey would essentially combine all thesource data or the tables that they wantto make available into viewand essentially prepare the view to makeavailable inside the cleaneronce you have your view configured thenext step is for you to apply youranalysis rules so think aboutaggregation differential privacy or labwhich I talked aboutyou would enforce those analysis ruleson this View and then you would makethis view available in the clean room asa listingagain throughout this whole processyou're not copying or moving the datayou're just making the data available inthe clean room for someone to come inand subscribe and run analysis againstso the data stays in placeso once you've publish this into a cleanroomnow this is ready for the cpg or who isrunning the analysis for them tosubscribe to this cleaner and run theiranalysis so what a cpg would do is comein in their own brick query projectAnd subscribe to the cleanerwhat this will do is create what we calla linked data set in their project thislink data set again is not a copy it'sessentially a pointer back to the shareddata in this case you have all therestrictions that the data contributoror the retailer has set for thetransactions data they're makingavailableonce you do this and of course the cpgwould have their own data that they havefor the campaigns and customers they'retargetingso what they would do is essentiallycombine that data with the subscribeddata from the retailerrun a query against this data and whatthey would see in the results set is thecombination of data that that have beencombined both from the retailer and thecpgso in this whole process no one hasmoved their data from their project itstays in placewhat the retailer has done is thatthey've made their data available withprivacy protections these protectionsare enforced at the time that there arequeries that are being runand again the result set is madeavailable to who is running the query inthis case the cpgwith their privacy protections and Blissso that's pretty much the end-to-end ofa typical use case of how you would usebigquery clean rooms in a retailer andcpg conducts you can also Imagine inthis case a cpg can also share data backinto this clean room and the retailercan subscribe to that data and run theiranalysis so you can certainly expandthis to a multi-party collaboration andif you'd like you can also have anentity resolution provider bring theirmatch tables into a clean room so youcan join the spare data sets so there'sa lot of interesting use cases andarchitectures that you can do but thegoal is that you're not moving the dataout you have the right Protections inplace to protect the sensitiveinformation and you can do all thisdirectly in bigquerywell we actually had a preview for bigcreated clean rooms for some of ourselect customers and L'Oreal actuallyused bigquery clean rooms for many oftheir marketing use cases and they founda lot of success with using bigqueryclean rooms for their use cases so theycan improve their retargeting formarketers and also work directly withthe brands that they're collaboratingwith and provide this end-to-endfunctionalityone of the most important things for alot of Brands is having that sort ofcloser measurement and being able tounderstand the ROI for the dollars thatthey're spending for the campaigns thatthey're running so this is reallyhelping L'Oreal succeed with providingthose insights back to the brands thatthey're working withand we realized that with clean rooms wecan't be successful alone so what we'redoing is that we're collaborating withmany of our partnersso for identity resolution or entityresolution we're working with live rampand Transunion so they can provide youthe ability to join disparate data setsdirectly in bigquerywe're also working with tumult labs tobe able to do more advanced differentialprivacy or anonymization against yourdataand lastly we're working with datacleaner orchestrators to be able toorchestrate clean rooms on behalf ofothers and be a neutral third party inthe context of creating cleaner and forthat we have haboo and Rupa Gupta isgoing to give you a little bit ofinsights on how haboo has built theirfunctionality and their experiences ontop of bigquery data cleaners so goodafternoon[Applause]thank you Nicole uh uh you know beforewe start and talk about HabuI would love to hear from you guysbefore coming into this room did youguys how many of you have dabbled withclean rooms know a little bit aboutclean rooms have done something withclean roomsawesome that's a that's a great set soby the end of this sessionit won't be just a data scientists thedata Engineers even The Savvy businessusers among you you will be amazed bythe power of clean rooms imagine beingable to join hands with your partnerswith no movement of data all done in aprivacy safe mannerso let me introduce you to Habu Habu isa data cleanup software company it hasbeen uh you know we are headquartered inSan Francisco we do this across a wholebunch of different you know Cloudproviders and all and today we are goingto talk about bigquery sois scalableit's simple and it's smartso how do we do this exactly so thereare three key pillars to itif you look at the bottom it'sconnect what is connectwe connect directly to your data youknow gone are the days when you have tosend files over gone are the days whenyou have to figure out what format is itparquet is it CSV is it gzip all thosedays are gone we connect directly toyour dataand then comes comply look with datarules are really importantwith Habu workflows happen with theright governance the right permissionsand the right approvalsand finally collaborate this is whereAdvanced collaboration is a breezebecause we have automated workflows wehave pre-built analysis we have querytemplates which is ready to roll outinsights and business outcomesso we all know the power of bigquerynikhil already talked about a wholebunch of things uh that bigquery can doif you think about bigquery with Habu ittakes collaborative intelligence to thenext levelI would say it's like bigquery onsteroidsnow why do businesses actually use thecombination the really powerfulcombination of Habu and bigquery firstit's a time to value if you're lookingfor for automated work flows pre-builtanalysiswhere clean room can be provisionedacross many many partnersHabu delivers all of itI would say it's like a Swiss knife ofdata collaborationnowon top of that Habu gets alongflawlessly with different Tech stacksit's uh the example that I give is it'slike a cool kid uh who goes to a partyand actually can mingle with any crowdat the partyit because remember one thing you havechosen your stack your partners havechosen their stackbut just because you have you may havechosen different technology does notmean that as a business you should notbe able to collaborateand then finally Habu throws the partyfor data and product teams but it alsorolls out the red carpet for thebusiness teams if you're trying toimplement use cases if you're trying toderive insights if you're thinking aboutactionable decisions Habu is there foryouit is a party that none of you want tomissnow let me paint a picture with theexample that I think nikhil started witharound retailer and cpg and let's put apin on the party because we'll get backto itso what we have seen with our with ourwith our clients and partners there arethree key things that they do with cleanrooms one is around planningoptimization and measurementonly by querying the full user leveldata with the right privacy andgovernance controls on top of that onlythen companies can effectively planoptimize and measurenext moving beyond insights companiesare also trying to take it to the nextlevel and activation they want to doactivation in addressable media channelsand then finally more than SQL thinkabout propriety code think about whenyou're collaborating how can you engageenrich your data enrich the partnersdata enrich the combined data usingpropriety codenow here's an inside Peak into habu'soperationremember we talked about a party thatyou all want to join and hopefullyyou'll join uh this is this is where uhlook if you're a for data Engineers youknow data scientists wherever there'sdata there's a party but I want everyoneincluding the business users the dataanalysts everyone to come to this partyso let's see how this goesso this is where in Habu the MagicBegins so right now we're in apre-planning phase we are planning adata party sothere are data connections here youconnect to your data whether it's yourbigquery table whether it's authorizedviews whether it's GCS locations whathave you this is where you connect tothe datanow once you have connected the datathis is now you're you're setting astage for the clean Loop this is yoursetting I'm going to create a bigqueryyou know and now you are setting somerestrictions on it so this is where yousaid I'm going to put differentialprivacy controls over it which includesnoise and Cayman enforcements thisensures that no individual level data isexposed ever out of the screen roomnow next what you do is you have row andcolumn level filtering this is where youas a data owner tell us what are therows and the columns that you want tobring into the clean room this gives youtotal control over the data that goesinto the analysisnow the stage is set it's time for someinvitations to be sent you can extend aninvitation to know your collaboratorwith a very simple email workflowremember this can be a multi-particle inroom and you can have many partners andand now invites are out collaboratorsare coming in they are managing theirown data sets remember they are puttingthe same restrictions that you put inthrough row and collaborative filteringthrough analysis rules all is happeningnow each analysis and pre-builttemplates now becomes a collaborativeeffort this is with everyone bringingtheir data sets to the tablewith the restrictions that they had putin imagine this in a party scenario it'slike a music where you are you knowyou're collaborating with someone I loveBollywood for example music I knownikhil loves hip-hop so it's it's acollaboration of all the different musictypes and we know in this collaborationparty both Bollywood and Hip-Hop will bea hit so this is where you are makingthat uh connectionnowthe stage is setthe lights are bright music is on andnow it's time for the information toflow this is where you can execute thesequestions you can schedule them theresults start pouring in and you canalso access all of this via apisbut there are two personas that wetalked about one was the data andproactive we haven't forgotten aboutthemdata and product team can create theirown templates they can distribute themall across so we have a question Builderwhere you can write your own SQL or youcan write your own code we also have acool assistant we have to talk about genAI uh this is a cool assistant a Generaassistant that actually is like aco-pilot for you for the data andproduct teams it helps you write the SQLimprove your SQL and on top of that italso helps you explain the SQL to yourcollaboratorsyou can explain it at different levelsyou can explain to a business user youcan also explain to a more technicaluser all that is available in the hubuplatformand then finally we have not forgottenabout our business users Habu comesequipped with a bi tool we havedashboards there are kpi settings thereare alert configurations and we alsohave achat module which allows you to questionask questions to your data come toconclusions ask next questions come upwith kpis come up with alerts all thatit can be done with Hubble it's likegiving the Keys of the Kingdom to yourbusiness users with the rightrestrictions in placeawesome so as this session wraps up youknow I would leave you all with thethought that we started with regardlessof what role you play there is a datascientist data engineer with yourbusiness user clean room offers you achance to enrich your data with Partnersdata in a privacy safe manner nomovement of data required seamlessefficient collaborationthank you with that I'll pass it on tonikhilthank youthank you Rebecca that was wonderful andit just goes to show that how dataorchestrators like haboo and partnersthat have built amazing experiences ontop of bigquery and it's very seamlessespecially if you're again trying to goto market very quickly and make yourclean room offering available withinyour bigqueryso one thing I want to wrap up is uhessentially help you answer the questionof why choose Google Cloud for datacleanerswell first of all as I mentioned beforewe were the first to market for dataclean rooms with ads data Hub and we'vebuilt a lot of the technology for adsdata Hub on top of bigquery and whatwe're doing now is making thattechnology available for you to use yourown use casesecond thing is that we have the Best inClass tools to protect your sensitivedata and also govern the data directlyin bigqueryand all of this available is availablein the Google data and AI platformyou also get access to the completeecosystem as we talked about before wehave analytics sub that has hundreds ofdata providers that have thousands ofdata sets that you have access to so youcan enrich your data and combine it andjoin it to get new insights andInnovation for your organizationand last but not least we are the priceperformance leader so I talked about theunique capabilities of bigquery toseparate out storage and compute againthis is really useful as you're tryingto scale out and make clean roomsavailable for your partners and itreally gives you the ability to beflexible with how your data is beingused in the context of not only yourinternal analysis but also in thecontext of cleanersso as you come to a wrap I encourage younow that we are in public preview to gotry out bigquery data clean roomsdirectly in your consolerook and I will be here to answer anyquestions that you have but thank youall for joiningforeign"
