    "transcript": "[Music]hello everyone and welcome to building asafer future with Cloud security andleading security providers uh I'm joinedhere with uh three leading securityproviders that I'll introduce after Iprovide a brief overview of our overallsecurity ecosystem um and lay thefoundation for the convers ation we'regoing to have with this awesome panel umas it relates to the history ofinnovation Google's very proud of ourInnovations in fact we built thefoundation of of ultimately what is theapplication infrastructure of theinternet and we've leveraged thatoverall application infrastructure tobuild what we believe to be a superiorinfrastructure that we all know today isGoogle Cloud and so when we look atGoogle Cloud there's some coreprinciples that all of you really knowis fun fundamental elements of cloudsecurity whether that's a shared fatemodel and we'll talk more detail aboutthat or purpose built Hardware which ofcourse um with all of the differentInnovations around AI is getting youknow a lot of notoriety and then ofcourse key Technologies like kubernetesthat are foundational uh for what Googlecloud has built and a lot of otherclouds have ultimately built but thenthere's other technologies that we werefoundational around such as Beyond CorpBeyond Corp and that Infamous whitepaper that we createdum several years back became thefoundation of what we now know today aszerotrust and so these Innovations of courseare foundationally built on the factthat we support three billion usersglobally and so by supporting thoseusers we're in a position to understandthe security needs of each of you ascustomers but what's criticallyimportant is that we've literally builtthe foundation of Google cloud from theground up leveraging core securityprinciples that we believe aresignificantly differentiated from eachof other cloud service providers andwe're going to dive into some of thosekey principles in thisconversation um and one of those firstand foremost really starts with thefoundation of trust just like each ofyou as customers as we would expect withGoogle Cloud to have in any relationshipthat we all establish trust becomes thatfoundation and on and built on top ofthatis ultimately in ation we all know howevolving the security threat landscapeis how quickly vulnerabilities come outhow those vulnerabilities and threatscan be realized and it's very importantthat we have innovation in regards to beable to build components that deal umultimately with those overall threatsand then the third found the third thethird layer of the overall Foundation isall about Partnerships we all know thatGoogle Cloud itself is even with all thecool innovations that we ultimatelybuild we cannot do this alone and wehave to work with key ecosystem Partnersto be able to build overall controlsthat ultimately address this overallevolving threatlandscape andso as we start to pull the onion backand we start peel the onion back and westart to look at some of these coreelements of why you would trust GoogleCloud the first one is that each of youas a customer ultimately owns uh uh yourown data on Google cloud and then if westart to BU look at other elements suchas you know uh streamlining your networkwe have what we believe and we're goingto drill into this a superior Networkwhere you are able to ultimately rollout specific regions in a much moresimplified way with great uh uh agreater amount of uh use uh or userexperience and ease of use and then yourapps uh and data are available when youneed them what's critically important isGoogle Cloud has been built on the sameFoundation that we deploy all of theother applications that have been builton Google since the Inception uh of ofGoogle as acompany and then satisfying those keycompliance and Regulatory uh uhrequirements that each of you havewhether you know whether that's in theEU or whether that's in the US orwhether that's in APAC it's criticallyimportant that we are in a position tobe able to have those overall extensiveaudits the the compliance uh uh ingovernance that address each of yourcore security requirements and then ofcourse we also expand beyond that and wearefundamentally uh want to ensure thatwe're doing things that ultimately havea positive impact on the footprint ofthe planet and so when it comes down toit today we're already running on carbonfree energy and by 2030 we expect to berunning on overall carbon-free energy inall of our overall datacenters and then of course you can't bein any presentation where there's notsomebody sitting there clicking andtrying to count how many times we say AIbut what's really critically importantis that we can talk about how that AI isultimately helping the overall securityecosystem and we'll talk we'll dive intosome of those llms or um Palm 2 or evenSE Palm 2 and how some of our keycustomers have made decisions andultimately Partners have made decisionsto be able to incorporate that withintheir overall uh infrastructure to beable to provide differentiated SecuritySolutions for each of ourcustomers and then built on top of allof that foundational layer trust becomesInnovation and those Innovations allabout the core technologies that webuild in Google Cloud that ultimatelywere traditionally built in the datacenter and the first one of those isdata cloud and many of our security coreuh uh companies built a lot of theirTechnologies which will D de uh drillinto around what does data Cloud provideit provides the ability for all of youto actually look at the entire data lifecycle from data legs to data warehousesto business intelligence to analyticsthat enable each of you to leveragethose core Technologies to be able tooptimize security configurations andultimately provide a stronger securityposture and then when we think of openCloud I've already talked aboutkubernetes we know that's a keytechnology but Google cloud is differentthan the other cloud service providersis and we actually recognize that theyexist and as a result of that we builtkey Technologies such as anthos thatultimately supports multicloudenvironments because we know every oneof you as customers are most likelyusing all of the clouds for differenttypes of applications and services andwe want to ensure that we're creatinginnovations that incorporate withinthose structures that you guys have andthen when we look at trusted Cloudtrusted cloud is a intrinsic capabilitythat's built into the fabric of ofcourse our security ecosystem but overthe last couple years we've reallyenhanced that through stuff like mandantthreat intelligence that is by far thesome of the best threat Intelligence onthe planet but we're incorporating thatwithin our core products such as SE Palm2 uh and other Technologies uh thatenable us of course to be able to createand co-innovate with our partners andcreate better Solutions but alsoultimately provide you the threatintelligence that's necessary uh uh forthe evolving threat landscape and thencollaboration Cloud that's built on thefoundation of what is workspace andmaking sure that all of those coreapplications that if you are using thosewith workspace that you are able to inincorporate security technologies thatultimately meet the demand of what isnecessary for each of those particularapplications and then as we build onthat Foundation of trust along with theInnovations we bring together a strongsecurity ecosystem partnership thathelps us ultimately deliver what webelieve to be very unique value firstand foremost we find Google Cloud to bea very eager partner to work with otherleading Partners such as the individualsthat are on the stage with me to be ableto provide very unique SecuritySolutions and then those leadingcapabilities we leverage with areas suchas our unique user experience analyticsto be able to provide very uniquecustomer experiences to our ourcustomers and then when I talk aboutthat co-innovation when it comes down tofirst-party security technologies thatwe build in many instances we also stillwork with key Partners to build underthe hood such as our intrusion detectionsystems or intrusion prevention such asfirewall plus that we just announced atthis conference to be able to provideyou technologies that are leveraging thevery best of security that exist outthere and not just what we believe weshould be providing you tomonetize and then of course all of youif you truly are going to trust GoogleCloud ultimately we need to ensure thatwe have the robust set of securityTechnologies across our security uhsoftware vendors such as cnap or whetherthat happens to be governance risk andcompliance or logging or secure enclavesand so I'm really excited to be able tonow transition to the panel to reallytalk about how this trust Innovation andPartnerships comes together you know toreal really be to provide unique valuepropositions but first and foremost eventhough we are talking about partnerswith Google trust what's criticallyimportant is every one of theindividuals on stage here with me isfirst and foremost a customer just likeeach of you they had to create criteriaand ultimately drill into that criteriato identify who is the best cloudprovider and so we're really going toexplore with each of our our panelistswhy they chose Google Cloud what isdifferentiate about Google cloud anddrill into some of the key Concepts thatwe've already set the foundation fortoday so I'm going to kick off the panelwith passing it over to Chris so he canprovide an an an overall uh introductionand then you know a little bit ofbackground as well on uh you know whythey chose Google Cloud so first I'llstart with You Chris thanks Preston higuys I'm Chris leiri I'm one of theco-founders and chief security officerof ignite um ignites a datacollaboration and a data governanceplatform for all of business criticaldata so I I threw in a lot of wordsthere but at the end of the day all ourcustomers we've got about 20,000 22,000businesses that uh trust and run onignite um and they use um ignite toprotect and manage a lot of theirunstructured office docks and and othertypes of data in turn ignite theplatform runs on Google cloud and and soso a lot of the things that Preston wasreferring to earlier um are eitherdelegated or we build on thosecapabilities so there there's a lot ofuh let's call it dependency um there's asharedresponsibility between uh Google Cloudas a infrastructure provider as well asuh the type of things that we build atthe end of the day the customer isn'treally uh bothered about who has whatlayer of responsibility it's up to us topresent it and make it easy for them sothat's a quick introduction awesomethank you Chris over to youGenie I'm I'm jeie I work for exim westarted out life in 2013 as a uba beforeeven gner says they invented ubaabusiness but we all know better weexpanded about two and a half years agofrom being a uba that was local onpeople's environment to something thatwas going to be in the cloud we wantedto go sass we wanted it to go open andfrankly we wanted better volumes sowe've been talking with Google for about2 and a half years now and working withthem on saying what will it take to getpeople to move from their localenvironment to the cloud which for manyof you who may to be in the middle ofthis there is a lot involved with thatthere's the security of it the suddenlythe control isn't a machine insomebody's closet sometimes they need totrust somebody else and we made a choicevery carefully to go with Google in thatway we liked their avail ility but moreimportantly was their scope because atthe same time that we were expandingfrom just plain ueba into SIM and sourbases so that we could do all threewithin one SAS service we neededsomething that could take data from 500different vendor or actually 500different products from 300 differentvendors and bring it all in togetherinto one place to look at massive bigdata and so we liked big query for thatwe also have a history of working withpattern matching and machine learningand the AI and we like where you guysare going with that as well so it madeperfect sense for us to partner up withGoogle and continue on our path togetherthank you Janie yeah so yeah I'm I'mMatt mle I'm a technical engagementdirector at pal networks and my job Iget to work with a lot of our jointcustomers on building scalable andsecure architectures in Google Cloud butthe other big part of my job is I get towork with Preston and I get to workacross our partnership team withinGoogle to develop joint Integrationsthat we that we're making with GoogleCloud so you mentioned a couple alreadyso it's a it's a it's a great spot to bein because things are constantlychanging we're also constantlyinnovating to actually help our ourjoint customers but to get to yourquestion on why we chose Google Cloud asas our cloud provider there's a lot ofreasons but I think it ties back to umhow overall how the Google Networkconstructs are designed and built so atpalot networks we host the world'slargest uh threat intelligence databaseand that threat intelligence database iswhat feeds all of our Cloud deliveredSecurity Services for all of our ourcustomers around the globe so it plays aa critically important part in ourbusiness model but also in the overallsecurity of how we actually secure ourour our customers and how uh governmentsuse our our products so it's somethingthat's that's that's criticallyimportant to us thank you Matt and andMatt sticking with you for asecond I we started to drill into thesimplified network configuration I knowyou and I have had some a lot ofdialogue around this but can you expandand our articulate to to the audienceand to our customers here about some ofthose key differentiations that youfound and in that simplification thatare unique to Google Cloud yeah sosomething that's that's overlooked umand just is a this is a personal uhperception just you know talking with alot of different customers out there isthat in Google Cloud something that'svery unique is how you can create asingle Network that spans the entireGlobe meaning you can have sub networksin North America Australia Europe andsince they're all part of the samenetwork they share the same type ofcommon firewall rules they share thesame networking infrastructure so allyour routing is the same and is sharedacross all of them versus when you lookat how you know other csps do it it'smore of a copy and paste over and overand over again to actually have thatsame type of global footprint so byhaving that single Network you havelower costs from an operationalstandpoint you also have lower costs onthe total number of compute that thatyou actually have to run so that'ssomething that I always try to emphasizethat that's with customers that hey youcan have this type of global footprintvery quickly in Google that's also easyto manage and easy tooperationalize thank you Matt and thenChris coming back over to you uh and asimilar question to Matt I know you'vetalked a lot about you know theuniqueness of Google cloud and having asecure file sharing and secure enclavescan you talk about some of the uniquecharacteristics that exist in GoogleCloud that led to some of thosedecisions to ultimately build yourinfrastructure and that technology withGoogle yeah um you know our history withGoogle Cloud goes back to the early daysof cloud like like almost 2012 whenGoogle Cloud first released that's whenwe started to uh do stuff and as youwould imagine um storage and computewere equivalent I would say there wasit's grown a lot and we'll get into thatlater but those weren't the first mostinteresting things about why we ended uppicking Google and and actually buildingmore from thereum like I mentioned our 20,000 pluscustomers are worldwide and many timeslatency and the ability for someone inAustralia or whatever some Far uh flungpart of the world to get access to beable to work on on the file was supercritical and what really blew my mindfirst even back then in 2011 and 12 wasGoogle's networking um and obviously asyou can imagine we had tried it out onall the other vendors including ours wewe used to run pretty complex networksuh while we were serving customers fromour data center but what Google sort ofubiquitous networking with there's a lotof press about how much dark fiber theyowned and all of that but I think GoogleCloud got that out to their customersvery early on and that networking umlet's call it superiority from all theother tests that we were doing was thefirst thing that Drew us uh to ignite uhI mean Drew ignite to Google Cloud umand and since then it's grown quite abit I mean there's been a lot ofinnovation in each of these uh tierswhich which we've adopted thank youChris and Genie sticking with that sametheme clearly we've talked a lot aboutlike big query you know refactoring yourentire application you know going fromhaving you know the old school ways ofdealing with product management andgoing to each individual technology andnow you have an entire customerfootprint that you can run you know bigquery across in analytics can you canyou dive into some of those you knowthat not only big query and to set upthe qu you know the the the the uh someof your answer but but also other areasthat you guys have really been able toleverage to differentiate yourtechnology I can say from the ground upthere's advantages and we are not gravedancing but some of us do remember lastDecember when AWS was out from Brazil toCanada for 9hours Google has not done that tome the biggest thing is that ourcustomers come in we have customers thatuse ignite and we have customers thatuse palal to networks and we havecustomers that use Citrix and Juniperand we needed to be able to take a firehose worth of data in without anylatency without dropping without anyfailures without any problems and westacked you up we looked at everybody welooked at IBM we looked at Azure welooked at AWS and Google was the onlyone that could handle data at the scalethat we needed to handle it secondly wedo love the ability the big query at theback end because we use it not only forthings like to find anomalies we have alot of patents on machine learning todig out we just added a new one thatsays I want to know that if somebody hasPalo Alto service and there's one pieceof that Palo Alto service that suddenlyhas a dip in the amount it's stillconnected but it's less coming throughthe science of normal Google has beenable to meet us halfway to measure thaton everything so that years ago I usedto run security operations centers andsometimes we only knew something wentdown by the absence now we can know thatsomething is wrong by just volume andvolumetrically checking so using themachine learning built into that andusing the big query off of it I can nowsee something weird might be happened ifI'm getting less events from paloaltothan Iexpect thank you now I'm pivoting alittle bit uh to the term uh that isclearly if there was a cloud word itwould like dominate 98% of the cloudword is AI um you know let's drill intothat a little bit and just your thoughtson on AI uh you know Genie In generalbut also you know as we look at Palm 2and as we look at the capabilities we'rebuilding and to really tail off of bigquery and analytics which becomefoundational you know as we were talkingbefore on llms and and and how we reallytruly optimize you know what AI canprovide can you drill in a little bitthere on how you're exploring thosecapabilities with Google cloud and andthe potential absolutely uh we're veryinterested in the SE Palm to becausefinding a good llm useful for thesecurity space is tricky as we we allknow it's like you have mandiant thatyou has a certain amount that you'redigging from but the SE Palm 2 at leasthas limitations on what they look atit's not just open to anybody at theinternet if you went out to chat GPT andyou said something like is mimik catsbad yes there is a human being out therethat made a mimik cat so you cangenerate cat memes because that personis a jerk I don't need that in nck so Ican rely I like the fact that we canrely upon the Palm 2 as being morecurated in a data that we can look at aswe look at ENT we deal with zero Fox wedeal with a lot of other vendors but welike to be able to pull it all and pullit all together neatly and safely andgive our customers something that eachof their individual roles can rely upongreat thank you and Matt can you can wedrill in a little bit and kind of yourthoughts on you know not just SE Palm 2but also Palm to and just that coreElemental Foundation of what gen gen inthe potential that we have you know inour in our partnership But ultimatelyyou as a customer yeah I mean it's theit's the future of of cloud and also thefuture of of network security becausethe way we view it is that adversariesare going to be using AI to try andinfiltrate uh organizations and get dataout um we're already implementing AIinto a lot of our our platforms by byworking with Google directly and goingback to kind of the question that wasasked in the beginning you know why didwe select Google and that's not adecision that I don't think any of ofour organizations took lightly I meanthere was a lot of research that wentinto it um and it's because of theplatforms that Google's constantlycoming out with so on the AI front we'vedeveloped a new module within Googlethat allows us to Auto provide uh uhrecommendations for all of our customerson how to actually improve theirsecurity posture through their existingconfiguration and that's only reallydone not by just taking a snapshot andone point in time but it's done bytaking heris of data from from months oreven years of what that specificendpoint or specific firewall has seento provide that recommendation and whythey should put it in so that's justkind of this the beginning we've beenusing a lot of stuff with Google on howwe actually determine what a threat isby looking by putting it into our zeroday sandboxing services so it'ssomething that we've really embraced uhworking with Google over the the lastwhat five years together yeah yoursandboxes are lovely thanks Matt andChris I'm sure going to want to have alittle air time on on addressing the theAI question so before we pivot over todrilling into some you know uhcompliance um you want to expand alittle bit on uh just ignite and yourview on Google cloud and capabilitiesyeah um I'm I'm not going to say moreabout the SE P part I think both Mattand jeie kind of covered the core partsof it but what I was uh really excitedum even in this conference right fromthe keynote to some of the othersessions is uh overall Google clouds umhow it'sembracing how to bring AI to customersand and what I really like about it isuh you know what you can do with vertexAI the the other models that you can runwith and the reason why that's excitingfor us and an ignite is yes there arethe llms the standard ones that youcould use from just Palm 2 but but umbased on how our customer base is uh indifferent verticals we feel we cancreate vertical specific AI um these aremodels that understand let's say youknow architecture engineeringconstruction aec is a vertical that youknow we have lots of customers andfinancial verticals and and so for theseverticals a model um or an llm that ismore suitable to that um user base opensup all kinds of probabilities that weare just now starting to uh explore wealso working pretty closely with uhGoogle AI team to you know um try out afew use cases and see how this works inthe real world so it's very exciting butI would uh not say that we know what'sgoing to come out of it I think we arein such early stages that we can justhope to do it the right way uh theresponsible AI part of it which againall the Google folks have mentioned somany times about how your data is yourdata all those core parts of how Googleis providing this to us is supercritical for how we turn around and thenprovide that capability to our customersso well and and you drilled in and andyou mentioned aec and and clearly youguys also are deep into life sciencesand industries in general and as we knowIndustries require different levels ofcompliance and governance uh if we canpivot there and just kind of to drill inyou know can you expand on you know howGoogle Google works with Ignite toultimately ensure that you know thatdoesn't have to be a big concern ofyours and that you can address thoseoverall concerns for not only you but ofcourse your customers yeah um sure as aceso and and and I'm pretty sure allcesos in the audience um end up havingto do something related to complianceand we we have a saying in ignite thatthere is nobody that is in anunregulated industry you may think youare uh you feel like you know um I don'treally need to do uh or adhere to anyregulations um Until you realize veryquickly that there's always some boardthere is some standard that you arerequired to uh you know at least haveBaseline uh documentation and and all ofthat right so for isv like us we startedout uh doing the standard ISO and sock 2auditand and trying to do this uh on a yearlybasis um soon we moved into fed rampwhich is a completely different uh beastbut but it does at the end of the dayshow you what uh isv or a CSP as the FEDramp World calls us um what ourresponsibilitiesare and a lot of it I would say almost15 to 20% of these controls end up beingdelegated to your cloud provider and inthere working with someone like Googlethat partners with you that provides youall of the documentation you need andand from Google of course you get youknow all all the regular the sock one 2three audits the we even got a lot ofhelp on the fedramp side with the nistcertifications and all of that right sothat partnership is super critical umfor us to go run our audits which iswhat we then present to our customers toshow demonstrate to them on why they cantrust this environment platform whateverit is so so it's a multi-layered cakefor sure and uh building thatrelationship making sure you get thefeedback um you get the appropriate uhdocumentation collateral all of that issuper critical thank you yeah I washaving a a really good conversation theother day with Bard and theirunderstanding of270001 iso and and I want to expand onjust in 27,000 and the now the family ofcourse it's not just 27,1 anymore uh butJeanie you and I have had conversationsuh in the past about uh about joiningGoogle cloud and and how this has reallyhelped your business and accelerate inthese areas and would love for you toyou know expand on the topic well I cansay that we got our uh 201782017 as well this year which we hadnever done before we've done the 2701 ofcourse you know we did our sock 2 typetwo every year but it goes faster Ithink that's the best thing our our uhDrew was wandering the floor yesterdayand said so how how did it I when theyasked me this question he's like it madeit faster and so much easier because youdo have the documentation there which iswhat people need and people come and usetheir Sim and different pieces for theirown compliance off of that as well andsome of what we can build on Google andvisualize on Google Google looking likelooker and other backend tools that areembedded within our tool make it easy tosee compliance they make it easy to seeI just need a list of everything did itsucceed did it fail give me a list ofall the failures give me a list of allof this it's faster and it's faster topull and it's faster to generate it'sfaster to send out and it makes our lifeeasier and I presume it's going to startmaking our customers life easier toothank you and then uh I I'll I'll posethe same question to you Matt and thenI'd love to get kind of a secondaryquestion in there first is how is ithelpinguh some of those uh compliancerequirements but then also expandingknowing that you know paloalto is alsoan oem partner and under the hood Iwould love to connect uh you know thatthat conversation from compliance um youknow to how that's really supportingyour overall joint customers yeah and II think Chris brought up a good point onthat compliance applies to everyone surethere are different compliance standardsdepending on industry and to tie it backto the partnership of what we're doingwith Google so over the years we'vecompleted probably north of of 50Integrations with Google Cloud some bigsome small um by really just talkingwith customers and trying to solve theirspecific use cases so for example we'vedone some smaller ones where we've donethings like integrate cortex xdr whichis our Advanced endpoint agent withGoogle Cloud Beyond Corp to really justfacilitate zero trust between theendpoint and Cloud applications or we'vedone really deep Integrations that havetaken months if not even over you know acourse of a year or two to develop likewhich we just announced yesterday withfirewall plus where we're combining theSimplicity and scale that you get withany native Google cloud service but it'sbacked by uh or powered by our threatdetection and prevention Technologies soto tie this back tocompliance to deploy any type of networkfirewall inside of Google cloud or anyCloud environment or even in a physicaldata center requires conversations withyour network infrastructure team yoursecurity team of course uh databaseteams Cloud teams so it's not a adecision that's easy to make and and itit takes time so the whole point offirewall plus is to give customersinstant threat prevention capabilitieswithout having to have those long designdecisionconversations um so I think that that'sthat that's something that's going toaddress a lot of key compliance issuesfor for a lot of our customers awesomethank you thank you and I I think I'veasked uh enough questions of the of thepanel and I I'd really like to reach outto each of you in the audience and uhthe first thing I'd ask is as it relatesto just please step up to the microphonebut um would love to see if there areany questions in the audience uh uh forany of our panelists no securityquestion tooweirddon't beshy all right if there aren't anyquestions let's go ahead and spend thelast few minutes of just doing closingremarks uh we'll start uh with you Mattand then we'll just uh come back thisway through Genie and Chris and wouldlove to just hear you uh you know yourclosing remarks on on once again thatGoogle Cloud as a customer Butultimately how those customer decisionsyou know have led to what is a aphenomenal partnership ship and I'd ofcourse like to thank of you thank eachof you for you know spending the time uphere with me and and preparation forthis thanks for having having us um I'llkeep it shortso uh from a partnership perspective andthis is also how we benefit ourcustomers and how we benefit as acustomer of Google Cloud um by focusingon what our joint customers need we'reable to develop solutions that one allowcustomers to go toward zero trust whichis a big conversation Point aroundaround security and also how theyultimately adop securely adopt Cloud umI'm looking forward to what's comingnext I think a lot of the things thatwe've built and have announced at duringthis week are just kind of the beginningof of where the partnership is going togoso a lot of good stuff to come thanksman Jamie I kind of wanted to throw outsomething reassuring here AI has beenaround for a very long time the firstchat Poots were came out in the 60s forPsychotherapy assistance we startedseeing Alexa we saw big blue we saw IBMbib blue beat Gary Kasparov in the 90sand beat everybody Watson beat everybodyin Jeopardy it's not new it's not as bigand hype as chat GPT wanted it to beBard however is much cooler if you digit in there there's nobody's job that isgoing to be replaced by AI what I thinkwe all have hopes that it's going to dois make people's jobs easier as to saveprocesses as to help new people comeinto the security space more quicklyit's why we're working with the R&Ddepartment at Google to say if we have arole if I have somebody that is astrategically shaped high school studentcan I turn them into a sock operatorwith the right explanations with theright prompts so that they understandhey You' you've asked me this did youmean to ask me this or something morelike this to make it easier so that notthat they can ever be replaced becausehumans can't be replaced but so thatthey understand what are the limits andwhat can really be known about what isout there for all those of you that haveinterns encourage them and teach themhow to Google it's a verb Now teach themhow to Google and those languageclusters have already been there soplease be reassured that we and thesecurity are all working together oncommon information models on artificiallearning models and how we can talk tothe machines clearly and Bu The backendalgorithms that support thatlanguageChris um I I'd kind of want to call backto what Preston showed in those threelayers of trust uh Innovation andPartnerships in in how um we think ofGoogle and and also just in general ofhow we uh um you know build out oursolutions for our customers right so atthe very core is a certain trust thatneeds to be built um in and this ishappen in from the core of ourarchitecture infrastructure choosing acloud vendor making sure like theBaseline block and tackle things ofsecurity best practices is handledproperly right so that's at the verycore it doesn't matter what you build ontop of it but that's super important uhThe Innovation that's what we are we arein Silicon Valley I I think anybodywho's out here you're constantlyinnovating the last 6 months has allbeen about gen AI but 2 years beforethat was other Innovation whether it'smachine learning or other um you knowdigital transformation and Cloud scaleum availability and things like that soso that's where again it's reallyimportant to have a partner that's uhpartnering with you in this Innovationwhich is what we we talked about on theGen side um and and for ignite inparticular just because of ourInternational presence there is a lotand and if you just go back four fiveyears you've seen how the compliancelandscape has changed withgdpr uh coming in in 2018 it's 5 yearsnow already but 5 years later um there'slots of uh privacy Frameworks around theworld so you need a solution and apartner that will meet you worldwide weit would be really sad if we had to pickup partner where you could do it only inthe US but in order to do something inAPAC or in Europe you had to go do itall over again with someone else so sobuilding that with uh or building thatpartnership uh with someone who alreadyunderstands that is super critical sothat that's all I would say in closingthank you Chris I I do want to share uhjust for uh everybody in here um the QRcode that we do have up here uh we diddo a technical validation withEnterprise strategy group so please dotake an opportunity uh to uh uh uh takea snapshot of that QR code um and uh wehope uh that that will be a valuableasset and we drill into it goes intosome great detail Beyond even what wetalked about today on the stage um I'dlike to thank Chris thank you very muchand and Jeanie and Matt for for joiningme up here and um and hopefully you knowwe were able to explore a conversation Iknow each of these are Partners up herebut they ultimately as I I kicked it offour customers just like each of you uhand uh they you know hopefully some ofthese decisions that they made uh tochoose Google Cloud are going to bevaluable for each of you uh in eitherchoosing cloud or expanding on you knowthe technology innovations that you'releveraging so thank you very much forcoming to next uh and um uh appreciatethe time and uh I hope everyone enjoysthe next party today Take Care thank[Applause]youhey"
