    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good afternoonwelcome we are really excited to haveyou here today for our presentation fromCommunity Health Systems and the greatwork that they're doing with bigquerybuilding a foundation for AI andanalytics I'm Michael Ames I'm managingdirector for vertical markets at SadaI'm I'm extremely proud today as some ofyou might have heard the news we wereannounced today as Google's Globalpartner of the year for 2023 in saleswe're proudwe're proud of that but I want to giveanother plug for another announcementthat was a little quieter because Ithink that that actually has more to sayabout the communityand the ecosystem of Google Cloud thanit does about SATA itself about a weekago uh for the first time Sada wasplaced onto Google excuse me ontoGartner's magic quadrant for cloudtransformation now here's what's specialabout that it's not a Google Cloudtransformation it's Cloud transformationin generalSada is a Google Cloud exclusive partnerthe fact that Google Cloud's depth andbreadth of capabilityis enough that a partner who works onlyon that platform can achieve Gartnerlevel recognition is validation of thebreadth and the depth and the work thathas gone into Google Cloud over the lastseveral years and that's something thatI think we could all be proud of andexcited aboutso thank you for joining and we'reexcited to get uh moving forward on ourpresentation hereI want to start with thisso this is mesix years ago look at the Young pup IwasI might not have changed clothes uhsince thenthis was me at Google next in 2017. ayear earlier my team at University ofColorado deployedwhat became the first evercloud-based Enterprise Health DataWarehouse millions of patient recordsfull Phi we did it on Google bigquery itwas wonderfully successful and I came totalk about it at 2017. and I'mhighlighting this for a couple of thingsone this is the beginning of a storythat today has continued through thework of Community Health Systems whichwill be going into in detail two take alook at the question we were asking in2017could we cloudHealthcare in those days as many of youknow because I know many of you comefrom Healthcare backgrounds was stillextremely uncertain about the questionof can we even utilize the cloud andhealth care servicesand so another thing that I am reallyproud of today is six years laterworking in my role as a vertical leadand strategist with Sada we talked todozens hundreds of healthcareorganizations every year and nobody isasking this question anymore and to methat's really exciting and now it isjust a question of how far can we gowhat can we accomplish and that's whatwe're going to talk about todayso I would like to First and interestand asked to come up to the stagecome on up guysthank you MikeI'm going to introduce them and then I'mgoing to let them start talkingglad to have you bothso Ahmed is senior director of I.T overdata intelligence and business analyticsat Community Health Systems which you'llhear us abbreviate CHS throughout this Ifirst met Ahmed in the early days of thepandemicuh CHS had been SATA customers and wegot connected while Ahmed was leadinghis teamthrough helping CHS figure out how toreact to this crazy new world that wewere in in collecting and analyzing andReporting all of their health care dataand I was deeply impressed by hisconcern by his leadershipcare that he took taking very seriouslythat responsibility for his organizationand the people that they cared for andit's been an honor to continue to workwith Ahmed over the last several yearson a number of other Cloud initiativesso we're thinking thank you Chris is atechnical account managermanagementand and I'm I'm happy to have Chris hereuh because hey he's a handsome guy andthat helps any stage presenceumI'm just saying that Chris is raisingthe average for all of usa secondum Chris's involvement is such a perfectexample of how well the Google Cloudpartner ecosystem can work with the Sadaaccount and Technical teams working inconjunction Daily Calls weekly callswith Chris and others from the Googleaccount team working together in orderto help our customers achieve successand he's been an excellent outstandingcollaborator you'll get to hear morefrom him a little bit later sodone talking now for a little whilethis audienceknee hiding from soso uh yes sure so thank you for theintroduction and thank you for beinghere and thank you for the audience it'sreally honored to be with you andeveryone I mean before I starttalking about CHS our company I justneed to understand from the audiencehow many of you right now on the role ofthe executive level and the managementlevelwow and Technical and data Engineersdevelopers on the technical sideso I think we have 50 50. so yeahyou know data analytics role so I haveto get somesome engaging right now so we can makesure right now we will balance theconversation between the executiveamended side and the technical side andI'm available with any one of thetechnicalsumparticipants here to get dig deeply inthe Technical Solutions but uh just totalk about CHSCommunity Health Systemsstand distance 1986 I believe I joinedthem back in the uhI believe late 2018and CHSwe have facilities across more than Ibelieve 15 stateswe have 77 facilitiesthousands of acute care and we have over600 Physicians and when we are talkingabout CHS with one of the leadingHealthcare managements companies Acrossthe Nation and acrossin the United Statesuh and that gives you an indication howmuch data we have because we have datafor millions and millions and millionsof patients millions of systems uh Imean not systems but actually the datapoints that thousands of data pointsthat we acquire on a daily basis so it'sa very large data ecosystems and we'regoing to talk more about this but uhthis is CHS great company to work for bythe way we still have work from homepolicy so I had already to come to tocome to office with the permission of myCIO definitely importantpoints to keep thebut also great company to work for uhfrom Innovation perspective ourleadership support us through gettingthe new technology and that's why wepartnered with Sada and Googleum and and again going back to kind ofthe story that we're telling here if Ihad if I had put up a similar slide forthe organization that I was representingthe first time that this was done sixyears ago the numbers would have readtwo at the top and then probably a bunchof zeros after that right so the scalethat we're dealing with now is isexponentially beyond what has and whathas been dealt with then so nobodyembarks on a dramatic change in a cloudJourney without without reasons to do itum so talk to us a little bit about someof the conditionsCHS that led to your decision to moveyour data warehousing Foundation up intothe cloudI think that's a great question andmaybe most of the executives they theyhave this question in mind should I moveto the cloud should I stay on Premum Google's versus other vendors thatthey are actually providing similarservicesI joined CHS just for this specificreason because well I did it beforeuh with uh with AWS and when I joinedCHS it was the same challenges that youcan say you might already facing rightnow with an on-prem Legacy detail houseyou'll need to work with yourinfrastructure team Whenever there is anote down or I know it needs upgradeshow much we put in the upgrades you'remaintaining commodity platform in byyour ownso basically moving to a Cloud solutionthat helps you to Outsource all this tothe people that will do it best whybecause they have Army of infrastructureguys behind the scene that you willnever ever be able to have it on-prem onthe on-prem environment you need to haveyour system Engineers Network Engineersall this software engineer if you'rerunning aton of Linux nodes that you're runningso whenever you're facing an issueit's affecting you then you'll need toalso plan for all these upgrades andthings patching and all this kind ofstuffso moving when I joined CHS back in 2018these things were the peakCHS before my time they had what I calltextbook detailed housebasically built with all stages builtwith from A to Z from all our HRS amorsall the way up to our presentation layerto the cognos with all stages that wasthere alreadybut we were facing challenges we weretrying to struggle to finish our loadswithin 24 hours to finish from all theseehrs we will struggle sometimes when wehave one of the loads failureit's affecting our executive layerreporting they are collected and whatI'm hearing for the technical guys mightbe familiar stories so we were facingall these kind of issues that's when Ijoinedand honestlyat that time it was either that westopped investing more and more in ouron-prem infrastructure or we startevaluating Cloud SolutionsI came from AWS so I was biased againstAWS and it's good that I didn't go thisroute because now I know right now whenI did it was the right decisions backthen we evaluated all the free vendorsand it made complete sense to move witha data company that their businessestheyand that helped us down the road theylisten to us they listen to our roadmapsthe roadmaps reflects what we need itwas a successive story because of allthat so long story short it started asan upgrademodernization for your infrastructureproject and then it evolved to become adata foundational capabilitybecause when I joined at that time whenI talked to Paul Novak and our CIO Istart discussingin order to build the data capabilitydata capabilities in any organizationyou need a foundationyour data platform is a foundation foreverything in top you'll put datagovernance data quality all kind of thedata capabilities models on top of thatwe had significant issues with our dataFoundation we cannot continue it was adecision whether either to continue orat sometimes evenyou think about completely differentsolutions other than a data platform andit can be so tempting to focus on oh weneed to do some AI over here let's grabsome data and go do some AI or we've gotan interoperability problem over therelet's plug a solution in here and movesome data in without thinking about howdo you take a structured approach buildthat strong Foundation that other thingscan be built on so I'd be curious tohear like you mentioned issues ofperformance and refresh times and allthe challenges with patching and thosekinds of things at the infrastructurelevel but at the at the sort of businesslevel where their capabilities that youwanted to be able to do that you simplycouldn't have done under the oldarchitecture that you were hoping tounlock with the new architecture wethought that our data science group afew few years actually after I joinedand data science guys I love them andeveryone should like them they are thepeople that's with data they love datathey love huge amount of data and theyneed data sets they need to train modelsso the first thing when I met with theVP for data science he was asking meokayI need an environment to start mynotebooks and start myselfback in the old days it would have takenme right now working with anarchitecture team architecture solutionand then start building the solution andthen start presenting thisat that time he joined us when we werehalf of the journey with our gcptransformation and it took us literallyone week to stand his AIML sandbox andhe start actually running his models andstuff one weekthat's with all our security andarchitecture everything with thefoundation with the foundation you couldget there with it just put block this ontop of it and we are good to go and thenyou've made Happy data scientists[Laughter][Music]and Chris you were part of this likewhat are some of the other kinds ofunlocked capability yeah you know Ithink one thing that I heard a lot fromum and so for me um I spent most of mytime with um Ahmed and some of his dataanalysts is all around reporting so umspeed to reporting I'm using liquorstudio and some of our other bi productsum was a huge selling point lots ofquick wins a lot of excitementum you know we're talking about you knowhundreds of dashboards different reportsand so I think that that also helped tokind of sell the vision right you knowbecause you're able to um kind of buildup these reports see the visuals um veryquickly share them collaborate it's alldone in a you know very governed andsecure way yeah lovely lovely let's talka little bit umwas what was built here right so sowe've got two stages hereum but at the very high level Ahmed takeus through uh the the major componentsof the architecture and then for theengineers in the room I promise we'lldrill in with more boxes and lines yeahI mean as you can see from the slideit's pretty much a standard uh dataplatform as you built in many otherorganizations so you have your datasources in our case yes it's atremendous amount of sources they havehundreds of clinics facilities you haveall these other data sources that you'llget from the business side data sourcestoo so we are dealing with you hugeamount of data that we need tocentralizeon a daily basis that'sthat's one gift so the data sourcesaside and you need to support both uhbefore Googlebecause majorly as you know you have twomajor use cases in our business eitherbatch processing or real timeso before Google we supported batchprocessing with with the struggle we'restruggling with the patch processing ourSLA is actually that we can commit tothe business what 40 48 hours 48 hoursfrom the time you commit the record therecord in the EHRabout the patient safe to the time thatI can present the charge in a financereport for example that was my SLA atthat time 48 hours for the bet now weare down to six hourssix hours they are basically it's likeuh day and night yeah I mean that'samazing so 48 Hours means you know it isover two days because when the data isrefreshed then it's time before peoplelog in and see it before that data isavailable now you're down to six whichmeans essentially you're able to offersame-day updates on data yes which in afast-paced health system makes a hugedifference on the ability to be able tomake decisions and react to that datayeah and and usually the batch helpswith the financials that's the financedata processing side because thesepeople they can wait until next day toget their things together however wecould not and before in the Legacyenvironment support anynew real-time uh basically use cases nowwith the current platform we have ourfire store already up and running we gethl7 messages from our integration and wecan support near real time for theclinical use cases because the clinicaluse cases The Physician or the nursethey cannot wait until next day theyhave already a patients in the room sothey need to come up with more uh newreal-time decisions and that's you canget with such pets I think another thingI just want to drill in a little bit isthe question that we often get is wellat what point in the data flow is theright point to actually put data intothe cloud should I pre-process the dataget it clean on-prem and move it up tothe cloud when it's all ready to go orshould we do it sooner than that if Iunderstand right this is either of youthat the data Lake here is on the cloudessentially the data sources are onparameter in various places but but thatdata is going as as possible up into thecloud and so Transformations arehappening there yes yes that's true yeahand and I think with that it's kind ofinteresting and I remember um Ahmed andI had a many conversations about this umso gcp we have a couple of dataprocessing services and we have dataprocwe have data flow we have data fusionand so then there's kind of thisquestion of you know which one do I useright and it all comes down to use casesum and so you know with with the CHSthey're very very versatile in thatperspective leveraging multiple Servicesright to kind of fit the job that neededto be doneum so the complexity isn't shown herebut all that to say you know there'sfive boxes but within each one of thoseboxes there's about 10 different ways todo something and so it does take time tokind of put put that all together and weshould I mean that's probably a good agood moment to kind of go into a littlebit more of the complexity here and tohighlight a couple of those thingswhichever would you you would like whydon't you take us through some kind ofsome of the main points in thearchitecture and we'll drill down into acouple of places yeah I mean uhit's like any daytime house you can taketo us as much as you want but let metell you that there is a hundred pagearchitecture behind this yes yes so allthe secrets behindbut I have been through things by pagewith a lot of people so there's tons ofthings that need to be designed howevermy advice to even the executive leveland the technical level when you start aproject like this we invested I believeeight months not in this architecturebut what we call the security Foundationof European Clubthe security Foundation is basically uhsomething that you need to invest inone of the lessons that I learned that Ijust in my budget it was like 50k but Iended up spending almost like 250k on itbut it was worth the investment becausethat's where you can work with yourseesaw with your security guys they feelright now that their data is secured inthe cloud so behind this there is awhole ton of security Foundation builtthe news after you are done with yoursecurity Foundationbecause it's not like you're going toyour Gmail free account opening a freegcp and then you can get all kind ofprojects bigquerywe should keep that in healthcare butyou can do that yeah in healthcare it'ston of regulations that T3 care[Music]you cannot just have things talk to eachother from environmental environment youneed to make sure that no one will getinto your lake with any kind of uhsomething like all these things that youhear about in the in the news ransomwarethings like thatso and this is one of the things whenyou're when you're signing them see thethe agreement with Google you will findit there I mean we pay we reviewed itvery well that the security is sharedbetween you and Googleso you have to do your part in this andone of the good investments in my myopinion before you start a project likethis you need two people a new teamyou'll get from the vendors but to be onyour teama strong security architect and a strongCloud architectthese two are key for yourimplementation from day one so you'regonna pay a lot of money for thembecause they are really hard to find andeven data Architects hard to find but uhthis architecture as you can see fromhere from the side you can see all thesesources the EHR this is the yourelectronic it's operated systemsand other data sourcesall these and the top these are like newcapabilities so the data sciencethey're using bigquery ml bigquery soyouyou are actually your data platformFoundation is in the bottom here that'swhere you have your Landing zones yourprocessing Zone and curated zonessometimes they call it something likebronze silver and gold and our friendsdata brexit you know guys so it's thesame concept here so and by the way it'sit's the way the work has to be donesomewhere whether it's real time whetherit's batch has to be done somewhere sobigquerycan be used as now they call the lakehouse thingso bigquery is a great thing for you todo this it's completely coupled with theGoogle Cloud Storage so it's like thesame thing with Amazon S3 buckets allthese buckets and cloud storage bigqueryis integrated closely with ussoin the in the middle for the processingZone to get all your data sets tablesused and and this that's where theservice is like theHadoop sport that's called Datadata procone of the services that you'll findwith all the vendors if you're if yourenvironment is based on Hadoop it makescomplete sense to use dataprobecause you will be able to migrate manyof your spark jobs and all this kind ofstuff with just changing some parametersand guess what we had almost likea thousand or somethingcodesthat we need to migrate and we havealmost like almost thousands andthousands of tables that need to bemigrated so it was huge I think a reallygood example of something where um againsix years ago the first time this wasdone on Google Cloud there are a bunchof these boxes that weren't evenavailable there was no vertex Ai andthere was no serverless data proc lookerwas a third party something over therethey kept trying to sell to me and I'mlike who are these guys I'm on Googleright um but behind each of these asChris said there's a lot of differentways to solve every one of theseproblemsand that's where that cloud architect isimportant those are the services thatyour Google account team the thought ofthat we tried to bring to our customersis helping you to figure out okay whichof these really awesome Lego bricks isthe one that's going to solve theproblem we don't do data proc and Hadoopfor every data warehouse because itmakes the most sense for those who haveHadoop on-prem but for those who have itthere's a solution right and andregardless of what the on-prem componentis that you're using there's a solutionand if you've got you know the abilityto get in to understand those possiblearchitectures what you can do now thatwe couldn't do six years ago wasdesigned it in a way that that helpsmake the migration for you much moreseamless much easier for you yourengineers and your users down than waspreviously possible yeah yeah and Ithink one thing just generally um thatwe spend some time with is just changemanagement so you know we're talkingabout data proc um that was an easy oneright you know so if I'm kind ofengaging with Ahmed and others from CHSum it's a pretty easy conversation tosay hey you're using Hadoop now you'llbe using Hadoop in the cloud here aresome of the differences but more broadlyyou know you start to introduce some ofthe newer services on gcpum we really had to sit down and say youknow how do we want to tackle the how dowe want to tackle this issue right howdo we want to implement changeum Aqua did a great job kind of layingout the vision and so you knowcommunicating the vision was a big partof it but I think the other element wastrainingum and so you know we put together apretty comprehensive training plan thatwe worked on that actually mapped someof our gcp roles so if you say dataengineer what does that mean to CHS whenwe say security engineer what does thatmean at THS put that together and had avery prescriptive path to actually helpusers upskill very quickly I mean theidea being you know let's take all thedecision making out of the processinstead of saying hey go look at thislist of trainings and pick one we saidhere's a path for you to take here allthe courses and realign that to thearchitecture I think that really helpedwith enablement and adoptionand and this is like a journey-widebecause this was like for us like 18 Ithink 18 or 20 months projects fromstart to finish and because again youare dealing with tons of it's like it'slike this kind of um you know theirspeed if you have seen the movie rightnow you're trying to get the bestpassengers from from the bus while it'srunning right right right so the wholeyouW and your legacy is running it's notstopped that's right and in in parallelyou are working to try to do thismigration and at one point you areswitching from here to this side this ishuge this the the transition phase forus it was something like three monthsbefore we make a decision todecommission the Legacy side soimagine right now that you have allthese reports that your Executives theyare used to it and they are gettingthese numbers correctly every day andafter the migration you let you aregetting the same numbers correctly theydon't care about what's behindthey don't care about this engine butyou need to make sure it's ready rightnow validated verified so part of it thepeople that they are maintaining it'slike they all say people technologyprocess sothe people when I when we started theproject they were all LegacyTechnologiesso this was a cultural change and apeople change to change these people totrain them on the new technologies bythe time you are ready they can takeover from your vendorsso in order to go through this we hadsurveys we had orientations we hadpeople coming insome of them might tell you I'm notready to move to any new technology andthat's you have to respect that and someof them will say I I'm ready to moveso the people that they already willbecome your core team that help you inthe future and honestlyum from my perspective working with lotsof different Healthcare systems andcompanies this is one of the reasons whywe feel the CHS has been successful sofar and will continue to be successfulon this and I would have predicted itfrom those first conversations withAhmed in the early days of the pandemicwhich is a focus and an understandingkind of an empathy toward the users andtheir experience it's fun to look at thearchitecture diagrams and you can tellthe three of us could like geek out onarchitecture diagrams all day but in theend there's a user and you're askingthem to change their business and theway that they work and putting as muchcareful care into how you change theirexperience and making that smooth andseamless is as important as thearchitecture CHS has done a reallyexcellent job of that I'm curious justvery briefly off Matt if we look at thisjustfull disclosure for the audience becauseit's not all roses give me like one ortwo things that went better thanexpected and then one or two things thatwere harder than expectedyeah I meancognos the reporting layerso the we had I mean Chris has mentionedwe moved also to local studio and now itused to be data studio now they calledlooker studio and you have local Pro sothe looker uh and basically that was ashift that we decided from the beginningbecause data Studio or Luca Studionatively connects to you bigquerynatively just like a click create aconnection and then you're good so itwas also a strategic decision that wesomething like 18 months ago we startmoving some of our financials reportingand clinical reporting to dashboardsdashboard that was a shift and bigtransformation however we kept ourLegacy reporting environment which isour Cardinals environment Wagner's isit's it's when I joined it was one ofthe major things that we looked atand I asked the vendor already before westart any decisions each vendor need tocreate a proof of concept food cartonswith gcp with bigquery and it wentsuccessful we were able to create it itruns successful however down the roadwhen we started working on the actualcognosthe lessons that the learn that we learnthe proof of concept that we did waswith the latest version of cognoswe are running a six years old versionof hotthey do Commission all the cqm and allthis kind of stuff IBM went Innovativewith a lot of things with with Cardinalsbut I am running the Legacy versionand that's a lesson learned so when youare running something like that don'tmake assumptions go and invest time withactual sampling of all the componentsthat you are going to migratedon't ask the vendor to create a proofof concept for one of the use youractual reports or actual tables and actsof use run your proof of concepts withthat that was amazing I mean essentiallyyou were you were test driving the 2023model of of the carbut then when it when it when it cametime it turned out you were running the2017 model of the car and surprisesurprise you didn't get the same thesame output some I mean because we arerunning 300 reports yeah and 300 you'remigrating 300 reports yeah and ourdevelopers of cognos they are reallyInnovative creating custom stuff andthings like that and you need to convertall that together yeah and that and thatwas specifically around cognosis Legacysoftware yes yeah finally we're able todo it with help from Google IBM ourleadership actually supported us I meanbut my CIO was greeting me all the timeabout this soI'm going to move us forward hereum so one more kind of high level slideand by the way we hope to have a fewminutes for questions and and we'llstick around you can you can hit upAhmed and Chris with with questionsafterwardum just at a high level now uh kind ofwhat's nextfirst of all these two boxesat the beginning that's your foundationthat's what you need to have in placeyou need to have a modern platform dataplatform can scale can expand no issuesyou know no dependency on the on theinfrastructure so we are done with thisnow the next the name once you have thisFoundation govern adding because when Italk to my CIO for example we took datacapabilities model your datacapabilities model has the foundationand then you start putting thecapabilities on topthe foundation is done we are in the gumwe the next thing adding the governmentgovernance model we need to have agovernance model with your whatever themodel that you can adopt actually andthen adding the tools for thatgovernance and then adding the dataqualityand that's the the name of our ourpresentation too AI is a great thingthat's why I have everyone is headingthere but without quality data youcannot reach thatso governance and data quality is ournextthat you need to govern the data setscreating all our semantic layersstandardizing all this kind of stuff andthat's where are we at then we'll beable to expand when we say expand youneed to add more capabilities on top ofthat whatever you need to add is goingto comeand basically plug and play with allthis without issues and you knowbuilding building on that um one spotwhere I spent a lot of my time today ison operations you know what does day twolook like as you continue to expandthese capabilitiesum and you know how can you do thatusing gcp right and soum often I'm asked okay how can I usecloud monitoring to do to do this hereare some of our new projects what arethe dashboards look like for that whatare the metrics that we can look intoyou know how how can you help and soum as Ahmed is kind of taking his teamto you know forward right and continuingto build this platform I'm also kind ofsupporting that operation so theoperations piece of this grows as wellumdownload a few things so thank you forthe great workCHS one of the top health systems in thecountry doing this work helps to pavethe way for a lot of others beingwilling to come and share and talk aboutit talk about the successes thechallenges helps to pave the way for alot of others I'm here because I believethat our Health Care system in Americaand in the world is going to be betterserved with these Technologies and sothis conversation hopefully helpsaccelerate that that personal mission ofmine and I know a mission that I think alot of people a lot of people in thisroom have so if I can ask the audienceto take a moment give some Applause madatthank you"
