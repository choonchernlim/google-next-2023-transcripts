    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thank you everyone Thanks for uh thanksfor joining us for the session today uhon accelerated cost savings with APImanagementum hopefully everyone's had lunch andcaffeine although it is an excitingtopicum you know I'm grateful for everyonewho's joined us here live in in SanFranciscoum so today I'll I'll talk to youbriefly about not just accelerated costSatan but also an increase in Innovationthat increasing speed of innovation thatcomes with looking at apis more asproducts than as an individualtechnology itselfum my name is Neil Swartz I run outboundproduct management for apogee here atGoogle and and my path to API startedWay Way Back on network infrastructurethen went to Security applicationsecurity finding holes in various placesin infrastructure and apis andultimately led me here to to apogee hereat Google and in today's session we'llalso talk about business so not justpurely the technical underneath it butthe lives and the technology at the topum there's one question my timer's notrunningwhich means I can hold you here longerI guessthey're doing it cool I snuck in a fewextra minutesum so on the business side I think whatwe hear our customers talk about a lotis that ideally the fastest path thatthey can think of we would help themwith and that is to get their ideas andtheir company value as quickly in thehands of customers as possible andideally that's a straight line it's astraight line into a product and fromthere directly in the hands of customersbut as we all know it's not quite thatsimple and certainly not when uhcustomers are are changing how they wantto buy from you what they want to buyfrom you how much they want to pay forit Etcnow it's within within that context ofgetting value as quickly as possible tocustomers as we'll see in thepresentation apis play a very importantrole but to start off first like why isthat role so importantis because the reality of workingtowards this goal of getting yourservices and products and value tocustomers digitally that they're facedwith a multitude of not so straightlinesit's a very easy path to to get fromidea to you know to another idea but howdo you get to execution and specificallythis digital Journey for organizationsthat aren't the size of Google or thataren't the size of you know 500 athousand ten thousand peopleum those organizations tend to uh to runinto a couple of challenges and this isjust but one small piece of itso firstly in order to develop any ofthese digital Solutions there's theactual development cost itself like whatdo you or how many developers do youhave and what is it they spend most oftheir time on so there's a challenge onoptimizing the velocity for Developerson the other side there's the risk ofnow you've developed something customersshow up and start using it in massivequantities there's the hockey stickeffect that might happen in other wordsnow there's attention you have to spendon not just setting up theinfrastructure once but supporting itthroughout this peak of usage or eventhe reverse and that is cost optimizedfor those cases where you're not usingitall the way through to how do we securethis plethora of decisions that led toyou creating a product and delivering itto customers maybe not just within yourregion but making your businessavailable to elsewhere in the worldand then lastly but certainly not theleast at the end of the day you're usingtechnology and building apis to get tothis outcome let's get the value fromthe customer transformed into margin andrevenue monetization for youso the starting point of thispresentation is like look there's aplethora ofum challenges along the way to get tothis digital uh digital means ofcommunicating with your customers andsome of these patterns have repeateditself and that's led us to create a setof helpful technologies that ultimatelyaim to solve some of these problems howdo we get customers value from yourorganization fasterand three of the top questions that comeinto mind with customers is is not justsort of how much new technology are weusing how much of Google's keynote areyou using in your infrastructure but doI know that I I have the bestinfrastructure for my purpose am I usingthe right things out of all thepossibilities that we haveare we spending like enough are wespending too much could we optimize ourcosts could we lower our our monthlybillum or could we utilize and swap outentire Technologies so that certaindevelopers no longer have to focus oninfrastructure no longer have to focuson repeating themselves and insteadfocus on business Logic on topand then lastly across all of thissecurity is often seen as a tax that isapplied at the endbut we're looking at this as look it'snot just security for Security's sakeit's how do we make sure the data ofyour customers and your intellectualproperty is kept safe but also thesystems so that you don't inadvertentlyspend tons of money on for instance APIcalls that end up nowhereso while these questions are not uniqueto apis it is a big challenge formid-sized organizations and above tosolve for some of thisandI'm here to say as an advocate for apisthat the good news too is that apisthemselves offer a way for you to getall those outcomes that is to say apispower the majority of the digitalinteractions that are out there todayand have done so for decades but they'realso a key area for further optimizationand one of the biggest things thatmid-size organizations or even earlierstage companies have is not can youbuild something but are you building theright thing for your end customera large chunk probably more thantwo-thirds of the Silicon ValleyInvestments that go into companies endup in awesome products but no one'susing themso investing the right way but also theright ideas and iterating fast is onepart of where we want to go and we'veseen that companies that start utilizingan approach that favors looking at anAPI as a product we see that they'regetting better results both onoptimizing but also finding the rightproduct to buildand in general over the course of about12 months measured these companies thathave taken a strategic approach to apisend up generating more of them which youknow self-serving is obviouslybeneficial to to usbut for apis in particular and all ofthe ideas that you can help unlock thereare sets of other strategies at play tooand we've captured all of those um thosestrategies and all those capabilities ina set of a set of services that nolonger is just available to the largestcompanies out there but it's availablefrom whatever usage you have from thefirst API call you have up to thebillions that you haveum and this is sort of the area of APImanagement you've heard of it as APImanagement or full lifecycle APImanagement but the case in point is thatan API represents a contract it's thecontract it's delineation between yourgroup and the organization that buildssets of business logic and a partner ora business unit or you know an ecosystemdeveloper that ends up wanting to useyour infrastructure and I I'd call it acontract for a very specific reason it'san agreement between you and the otherparty to not change that portion of yourfunctionalityif you've done so you can iterate morequickly on the back end faster usingTechnologies such as the ones we'retalking about hereit's important to note that it's for forany use caseum quite literally it could start offwith simple integration use cases allthe way through to developer ecosystemsthat end up in multiple digital portalsof various kinds where new modes ofcommunication are taken care of at theend of the day they're all API calls andthey all represent similar value butalso similar challengesand it's this any scale that wementioned in particular in the currenteconomic climates to say look youshouldn't just have to lock yourselfinto massively long contracts bututilize exactly what you need and knowmore and spin down as you no longerneededthe other side of this from a costoptimization perspective is thatoftentimes when you pick a technology oryou decide a strategy around apis asproducts all of a sudden additionalconstraint constraints and concerns showup from a security perspective this isnot just the basic you know am Iauthenticating the right person or theright system am I authorizing them theright thing but also what type ofattacks do I need to defend against whatdo I not know yet from a tax perspectivewhat is all this new technology like genAI going to do with the consumption ofthese apisso there's an entire class of problemsin the security space that tended tomean you have to have a separate set oftools or a separate department for itbut we believe that that's notnecessarily the case you shouldn't haveto do that and then lastly for everydeveloper we we strongly believe thatsome of this technology should beavailable not just to a specific sizecompany for all of them but also enablethe use of these apis for any type ofdeveloper whether or not you're sort ofa hardcore directly into the weedsdeveloper or someone who prefers sort ofmore visual tools more Loco toolssofor us apis we're not just part of howwe got to where we are but we also thinkit's a fundamental enabler this contractto this product for new technology inthe futureand there are a couple different areasfor further maximizing value of theseapis like how do we do more with it it'sgreat that there's technology but at theend we want to get as much value out ofit as possible as possible there's sortof three different categories that welook at here including some interestingannouncementsso one part of this is at the end of theday you could stand on the shoulders ofsomeone else when you utilize someone'sAPI so how do you get your ideas fasterto life faster to your end customers orthe potential end customers andstandardize that access and reduce theneed for specialized skills for them totake and make use of this back backendservicethe middle section of this do more withless I run part of product managementand I'm always told by our engineeringteam like that's great you want 100things done but in reality we're onlygoing to fund 10 of those how would youapply that same prioritization mechanismto your own business by just carefullyselecting where you invest and where youreuseand then lastly we talked a little bitabout the security side there's much tobe said on that topic we have someseparate sessions for that that arerecorded and made available just to lookat how we bring more securitycapabilities in the hands of the peoplewho want to build apis but aren'tnecessarily Security Expertshow do you not burden your teams withsecurity overheadso with that in mind let's start withthe build faster how do we getum how do we get your ideas encapsulatedinto reality Faster by utilizing apisso one partum of what we've announced and we'reannouncing here at Google next is isthis notion of helping people go fromfrom a let's call it a novice API ideato something that is an expertly craftedAPI specification that could almostinstantaneously be utilized as an api'sproductand what I'm showing to you here onscreen is is duet AI cooperating withapogee to help craft API specificationsand ultimately deploy this inside ofapogee again the goal here is to helpthose developers that want to focus mostof their attention on something else buthave to make sure that this service ismade reusable for others madediscoverableand part of what we're doing here isenabling an IDE experience where certainprompts are put in like accept purchaseorders for specialized coffee beansthrough a web APIthe very first part of this is that wetake you know General understanding ofwhat API specifications are and helpsuggest the specialized statements thatgo in therenow at certain scale once you startedusing this what becomes interesting isthat these specifications that areofferedum will start to be made better based onother specifications that it has accesstospecifically for mid-size organizationsassume that you have a catalog of allapis that becomes input to train thiscase the model to help your teams bemore effective get to API specificationsthat are built with this idea of productfirst in mind and get to ideas fasterwhat we're announcing later here in nexttwo is that there's a trusted testerprogram that you can you can apply forat the end of the slidesbut this is one of many places where wethink that we can accelerate thedevelopment of those ideas into value toyour customers by making use ofTechnology again not technology forTechnology's sake but for an end goalanother part of this too is to make thetechnology fit into more of the usecases that you might have and withoutdraining the entire slide at the end ofthe day an API gets processed somewherebefore it's fed to multiple differentback-endspart of this is what we call the runtimethat takes care of all the functionsthat we briefly spoke aboutand one of the developments in this areais to make it possible to load a set ofpolicies across all the apis you havewe'll call that standard API proxy andthat could be used as a starting pointto just put up a facade in front of anew service that a team has beenbuilding without really bothering toomuch about what the ecosystem is thatyou're building around itand then contrasting that with what wecall an extensible API proxy which isessentially Soup To Nuts everything thateveryone knows about API managementdetailed policies authenticationauthorization Transformationsecosystem management developermanagementEtcnow the reason I just even touched thishere is that the the tooling that is nowavailable allows your organization tomove fast while already standardizing onon the technology that will be helpfulto Monitor and ultimately monetize theseapis uh in the protection of course aswelland on that note another part of um ofthe overall offering that we think isreally relevant for mid-sized companiesand above and even smaller companies isthis notion of being able to start offwith an APIagain generated for instance with duetAi and then fast iteration in the backend using what we call applicationintegrationthe notion here is that humans bydefinition want to optimize for theirown time and we agree we want to do thesame thing and what we've noticed isthat workflows and Integrationstypically tend to follow a number offixed patterns that always start offwith a trigger on the left hand sidemost of the time as an API call set ofdata Transformations a set of conditionsthat are brought in and ultimately a setof connectors to either drop in or fetchadditional data that entire sort ofSuite of functionality is beingRewritten hundreds of thousands of timesand instead of doing so what we'resuggesting here is take this approach ofprojecting value to customers through anAPIturning that into a contract thatdoesn't change for your partners or foryourum your development partners and at theback end iterates super fast on whatthat workflow can look like and onceyou've settled on something that's ofvalue for your end customers then youcan further optimize and maybe furtherenhance it and that's what in this casea visual path of helping you iteratefaster these Integrationsso all of that the main attention isbring ideas to Market faster becausethat's one of the big differentiatorsthat you you have by utilizingtechnologyagain not technology for Technology'ssake but for a particular purposethe other section or the other big areawhere we think there's more optimizationpossible in maximizing value is to lookat well how do we take what wasoriginally true for large organizationsand slice and dice it down to a set ofusage patterns that fit yourorganizationand without going into details of thecommercials one of the things we'venoticed is that these technologies thatare available for apis would like liketo follow the model of exploring yourideas first trial it when with what wehave and then matching it with either ashort-term contract literally whateveryou use is ends up being paid for or gofor longer term fixed cost setups withsubscriptions the only reason I bringthis up again is to show you that thisis not just technology available forlarge organizations it is in fact veryhelpful for for smaller teams andsmaller organizations toothe other big advance in this area is tosay well that's great we have technologywe have an API management platform wehave something like a product but how amI going to make my case for other partsof the organization or how am I going tohelp other teams do work for me as theAPI developer in this caseand one thing we've noticed is thatum oftentimes a lot of the analyticsdata from apis the behavior of certainclients certain applications that comein or the relevancy of the developerprogram like how many people haveum you know active developer tokens forapis that type of technical informationis not just relevant for uh for theteams that run the platform but also forteams that are on the business side whoknow more perhaps of the financialtransaction that happens the you knowthe rate at which people will completepurchases the reports that have to begenerated around costs the reports thatthat varies Folks up in the treatmenthave and one of the things we've done islike rather than having you createfurther Integrations why don't we justcreate the capability that all the datathat pertains to these apis is madeavailable in a business intelligenceplatform in this case Booker data studioand with that immediately an entire hostof reporting questions and dataanalytics questions is moved away fromthe harder core technology of APImanagement into the realm of pure dataintelligence so we bring API informationthat's in apogee we bring that over intolooker for intelligence we also do thatin a cost-effective way by not justcopying a bunch of stuff make itavailable as a data source and theneither come up with standard dashboardsor use AI inside looker to ask naturallanguage questions about data sets abouthow the joining of two or three or fivedata sources ends up with a result forthis API program or this type of actionthat's takenso with that we're bridging between thevarious technologies that are there andwe're doing it without turning that intoyour problem and we think that's sort ofa pattern that we're we're trying to gettoand then lastly on sort of maximizingvalue this is only so good to the momentthat you can trust it and the trustFactor here is is critically importantwe think and it's important because it'sall your data it's a new entry point inyour organizationand what we've done there and we'll keepdoing is riding along with everythingelse that the larger Google Organizationhas made available and is announcinghere inum in Google next as well and that isconceptually to take the information wealready have about these apis about thethe ecosystems that you've created thetransactions that pass throughtake that analytics data and unleashsort of security models on top of itso not just look at policies that arecreated but also the activity on theseapis what is anomalous behavior from apure API perspective that's whatanalytics offers today what do we wantto add on top of it things like botdetection like who is scraping our datawho's going off with all the you knowthe purchasing behavior that you have orthe entire price list catalog you haveor isum you know maliciously impactingmarketing numbers based on fake requeststhat come into all of this all rides on the sameinformation and the past World it meantthat all this information had to begiven to a security department expensiveenough so what we're doing here is we'rebringing those security capabilities tothe API management platform and in thiscase riding along with what's alreadycollectedrunning models against it models againstthe trafficand it's the same machine learningmodels that are utilized for largerGoogle properties in the outside worldand continuously recognize activitiesthat don't really fit well with thenormal behaviorand obviously identifying it is greatbut if I tell you there are a thousandthings wrong you clearly want to knowthe next step which is what are yougoing to do about it and that's where aset of mitigating actions can be takenby the same API platform again itdoesn't matter if you go you know thethe you only have a few apis or you'vegot billions of API calls the samecapabilities exist and are madeavailableand in this case mitigation can meanmany things it can mean look we don'twant to actually receive this trafficwhatsoeveror we want a signal to your businesslogic in the back end this looks kind offunky we've received it from a certaingeography we've seen certain behaviorthat makes us think that this is notreally legitimate traffic but we don'tknow enough yet we want you to make anext call then it might be that you knowyou're you're not going to give thisparticular product to someone else oryou know you'll lose some extra fraudchecks in the back endthe key though is that the problem ofsecuring these apis becomes acollaboration between your team in thiscase uh us an apogee and your securityorganizations and the context is sharedbetween the twoand this at the end of the day all leadsus toum to a set of main questions that is dowe have a way to look at apis not justas technology but as a way to unlock andto explore new and open new use casesfor end customersand we think the answer to that isabsolutely true yes we see many of ourcustomers generate new revenue streamson the basis of creating apis and theyfirstly started off with using apis purelist integration technology and startedmoving in the direction of moreecosystems creating adjacencies byintegrating with partners that areadjacent to them creating net new entrypoints for new customers all the waythrough toall the way through to capabilities thatallow you to engage with newer Stylesdevelopers that work in entirelydifferent fashionsso apis really are at the front door toevery digital asset that you have inyour organizationand one particular example of a companythat's gone through this journey with usand is still on this journey is thiscompany called L'Oreal everyone knowsthem large Beauty brandbut what's fascinating to take away fromfrom this particular example is theymove from the origins of apis as purelymeans to get faster communicationbetween disparate parts of theorganization to sharing more serviceswith other groups in other wordspromoting reuse reducing costs byvarying the costs across multiplebusiness units all the way through tonew capabilities in apis as productsthat are created by engaging developersmarketing organizations with the productsets they have through digital meansand again this is a multifaceted notjust purely one API technology but thestarting point is an API is a productturns into a contract where the party inthis case L'Oreal has the capability toiterate fast on the inside of theorganization while the outside can relyon a known interface into theorganization that is trusted andprotectedand in general what this points at is isa concept that I've not named but I'vetalked about here another is to rope inthe platforms more and more to abdicatefunctionality into and for those of youwho are closer to software developmentyou've heard the industry and we're partof that toowe've heard you've heard us talk aboutshifting left moving certainfunctionality whether or not it's from acode quality perspective to securityvulnerabilities move all that burdencloser to the earlier stages of productdevelopment or in this case softwaredevelopment in building and developmentlet's move most of the technology leftin addition to that though we've seenthat that generates sets of concernswith development organizations we're nottrying to turn everyone into a securityexpert we're not trying to turn everyoneinto an API expert some folks arededicated mostly to business logic andthey should be and the the term thatwe've we've worked on here is to focuson shifting downin this case shift the burden of some ofthese integration capabilities some ofthese API capabilities further down intothe platform so that you're freeing upyour development resources to work onthe things that truly create value thatare differentiated to you and we thinkthat you know by by making use of apisand looking at them as productsutilizing a platform that helps yousecure it and go faster we get thisNifty model where you can shift thatburden further down while controllingcost in running that platformso we've got Jeff one more term not justshift left but we also want to shiftthis functionality down into theplatform and we're happily we'll wehappily do this for lots of customersand we happily do it for moreand just to sort of prime more ideasum there's sets of examples here ofcompanies that have used apis as theircore strategic tenant to explore andopen new revenue streams and they're notjust limited to Pure tech companies likeFinancial Services everyone hereprobably knows stripe their biggestproduct is essentially an API there aremany of them right now but the key thingis they've spent so much timedeveloping and crafting the APIitself and helping developers get intothis ecosystem that they've now becomethe de facto standard in paymentslikewise for other technology companiestwilio is very well known source foranything communication related if youask a crowd of developers like who'sreally sent a text message using OldSchool Technology the answer right nowis like mostly none like everyone usessomething like Twitter for itbut the core there is it is a product inthis case it's the API and your teamscan depend on it because there is acontractall the way through to not justcapabilities that are technical naturebut also data sharing so think of yourorganization what data can be made intovalue for partners or for otherdepartmentsone very prominent example AccuWeatherwhere they're exposing data for specificaudiences tailored for specificaudiencesyou know in addition to the primaryOutlets that they have in separateapplicationsall the way through to look maybe you'renot into Data necessarily or intotechnology or payments financialservices but looking at how youcommunicate with a community how youcommunicate with a set of your end usersslack and Shopify are two prime exampleswhere the Baseline experience isdelivered but extended using apis asproductor for Shopify where buying experiencesare tailored entirely for new sets ofaudiences again possible using apis asproductsto improve virality of products or getthe the product information out there inmore placesthe key at the end of the day for us isthat apis as products provide us a waytoum deliver the capabilities in a farlower cost than was possible in the pastwith far fewer people necessary to getthe get them done and scale it up tomultiple new revenue streams across theworldI'd say with that we've got some timeleft over for questions but I'll get tothat only after saying look there's atrusted tester program that we'reopening as part of apogee and this isfor the various generative AI basedadditions to uh to apogee and Googlethat were that we've been announcing soagain one of it is cloud code or vs codeextensions and there are sets of otherenhancementsum around plugins that are being madeavailable too so if you're interested inthat please register in The Trustedtester programthank you[Applause]"
