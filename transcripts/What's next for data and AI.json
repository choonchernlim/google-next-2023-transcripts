Google Clouddata analytics and AI are already havinga profound impact on how organizationsoperate it helps them to become morecustomer-centricto innovate faster and to run moresustainably so to get us started let'stake a look at how some of thesecompanies are doing this with Google'sdata and AI Cloud todayjuicy an adventure tourism company usebigquery to build an AI driven customerself-service portalfor instantaneous business insights andto make fast decisionsnow they are driving 97 of their saleswith zero human interactiondone in Bradstreet they combine theirdata Lake and their data warehouse intoGoogle Cloud Storage with bigquerythey gained new analytics capabilitiesand they built new data productsand all while improving the analyticsperformance five timesPriceline uses bigbury's AI capabilitiesand their own proprietary algorithms tooffer personalized services and torecommend products to their customersPrice Line applies generated AI to offersophisticated trip planning suggestionsto their customers as welland Priceline employees will benefitfrom easier access to internalinformation and realize realproductivity gains by automating some oftheir time intensive content encodinggeneration tasks with generative AISG Bank traditionally used on-premiseinfrastructure but as they grew largeras stake room more complex they realizedthat this would become unsustainablethey moved their data architecture in asingle platform on bigquerythey interconnected176 Banks they improved their datasharing and all while reducing the datainfrastructure costs by 50 percentand a big shout out to all of the tensof thousands of bigquery customers outthere who are running billions ofqueries who are analyzing exabytes ofdata every day across Cloud isn't this amind-blowing scale[Applause]so before we go into what's next let'shear from one of those customersdirectly and how they are taking actionon their data with Google's data and AICloud please welcome from Wendy's the VPof data management and analytics WendyEricksonhey Randy thank you thank you so muchfor coming please have a seatso to get us started for the ones whodon't know tell us a bit about Wendy'sgreat so Wendy's is the second largestquick service restaurant hamburger chainin the United States we have about 7 000locations in more than 30 countriesWendy's is a company that has Innovationbuilt into our DNA that really startedin about 1970 when Dave Thomasintroduced the first moderndrive-through changing the qsr industryas we know ittoday we're focused on global growth anddigital acceleration and with that we'rebecoming a true digital technologyenabled companysoof course we want to hear about the dataand AI strategy advantis of courseour strategy at Wendy's is to build acentralized trusted source of Truth andwhen we get everything centralized wecan take those pieces of data andcombine them into really rich insightsinto what our business is doing weleverage bigquery for our data lakehouse which makes our informationavailable in relevant time and easilyaccessible for our business to use itprovides us a really rich foundation forus to tackle a variety of AI and datause casesfor example I can tell you withinminutes of an order being completedexactly what that order was I could takethat and then combine that with purchasehistory and promotions that we havecoming and use that for PredictiveAnalytics and demand forecastingthis solution along with some other datahelped Drive our decisions around ourPrime locations to build restaurantsand I can't forget to mention our mostexciting use case which is usinggenerative AI in our drive-through innatural languageso you're serving customers customersare very important and you build yourcustomer data platform on bigquery canyou sell why you built your CDP on topof bigquery absolutely we made thedecision to build our CDP on top ofbigquery for multiple reasons firstcustomer data should drive every retailbusiness and it's certainly the core ofour businessmaking that not have another data Siloand making it easily accessible forothers in our business was extremelyimportant to thatnot to mention we have over three and ahalf million monthly active users in ourloyalty program so we needed thescalability of a platform like bigqueryto handle that loadum our second reason for doing this waswe needed to control our customer datarather than allowing a tool to controlit for us this allowed us to pull thatdata out of the tool making it availablefor any of the tools and easily able toswitch out any of the customertechnologies that we might need tofinally we know that over 70 percent ofcustomers today expect a personalizedexperienceand we needed to deliver that and so wepulled our CDP out of any other platformand put it into bigquery so that wecould build on things like CustomerLoyalty we could build product Affinitygroups and build greater personalizationwe could then start to understand whatthird party data how weather impacts ourconsumer buying behaviorsno that is really interesting becauseyou just add better data and I knowyou're using traffic data and all of thedata is you know is outside data rightso can you tell us a bit more how youuse third-party data sets in your datalandscape absolutely it's a criticalcomponent for our data landscape formany reasons so we use things liketraffic data and competitive Landscapesto determine where the prime locationsto build new restaurants arewe use weather data and events data tohelp us with preparing our inventory toensure we have enough inventory and heyyou may have heard of those super fundReggie Bush commercials that we havethat's because we have the third partydata that tells us 30 percent of ourcustomer base our football fansI love it and you know well you know wehave to talk about AI right so of coursecan you tell us a bit about the AI usecases that you're building with you knowyour data for vandies absolutely I thinkwe've just begun to scratch the surfaceof the AI use cases that we'll see andI'm super excited for Wendy's to leadthat Journey as I already mentioned wedo use voice AI in our drive throughthis is a platform that Wendy's callsfresh Ai and if you haven't done so Iencourage you to go check out theShowcase that we have going on we won'tstop there though there's plenty of usecases that we're testing out probablythe one that I'm the most excited abouthas to do with solving a problem in thedata spaceso we all know about the real challengesof data data silos data accessibilityyou know confidence in the data Relianceon the technology teams to build outvisualizations of the data Wendy's iscurrently testing multiple approachesusing generative AI on top of ourtrusted data sourcesto help solve that problem but thinkabout that I mean the possibilities areendless when we get that right so manyof the people here many of the customersright you know that that we hear aboutthey're all thinking about generative AIright so as you said Randy's off to agreat start you know you haveimplemented and actually operationalizedyour first use case with generative Aiand you know I really wonder you knowwhat helps Wendy being a tech leader andan innovator in that spacebuilt into our DNA as a company butadditionally I think our people are whatmake the difference we have fantasticPartnerships such as the partnershipthat we have with Google we have areally strong Business and Technologyleadership team we have aforward-looking board of directors whois always challenging usand our CIO is known for doing theimpossible so we can't forget to mentionthatbut equally important we have a reallystrong relationship with our franchiseesand they are constantly volunteeringtheir restaurants to be early adoptersof these new technology advances so youknow last but certainly not leastI have to ask the question why did youuse a choose Google cloud and what isthe value that you have realized from ityeah of courseum so we chose Google Cloud for multiplereasons we needed the you know computepower so it not only does it have thecompute power but the offerings that weneeded to make our business successfulyou're also a leader in Innovation sothat adds to the mix what I would say isthings like the power of vertex AIalongside of bigquery let us performthings like sentiment analysis on socialmedia Impressions that we're listeningfor if we take that data we can then addin some of our operational data likespeed of service and labor reporting andwe can really start to understand whatis driving that social media impressionwere we slow that day what was what wasgoing on in our restaurants that dayfrom there we can then run some what-ifscenarios and change different businessinputs to figure out what is the rightcourse of action to solve those problemsGoogle is also an innovator in Ai andbecause of this we know that we candeliver an elevated experience for ourcustomers in the drive-throughsthink about this for a second this is aMonumental task that we're performingtogetherour menu complexity is enormous there'ssomething more than 200 billion waysthat you can order a Dave's double thatis amazing right I have no idea yes 200billion and the complexities are beingsolved with what we're doing togetheradd in the noise and the issues that youhave with a drive-through speaker itit's huge it's a huge task that we'redoing we also know that over 75 percentof Wendy's customers choose thedrive-through as their orderingpreference so we have to get this rightbut we're confident with Google beingour partner to get there that is soawesome thank you Mandy for sharing youramazing data and AI Journey with ustoday absolutely thank you thank youthe power of AI really allows us tore-imagine what we do how we do it andwho we do it for in virtually all partsof an Enterprisejust like the example from mandis we nowhave the most powerful technicalinfrastructure and the best AI models atour hands and for many companies itfeels like just being this one step awayfrom turning AI into your Enterprise AIand start solving real business problemslike we just heardthat step is to activate your data withAI your data is your most valuable andyour most differentiated assetit's the key to unlock the power off AIfor your business it is the informationon how your business runs it's theinformation on what makes you unique foryour customers and it can hold thesecrets for making it better for somelike the customers that we have justheard about it is a small step toactivate our data with AI but for othersthat step is as wide as a canyonrendering an AI driven future a distantdreamthe solution is to understand data andAI in dualitythe solution is to build on an AI dataFoundation to make AI easily availableto all your data practitioners and tomake your data easily accessible to AImodelsand there are three steps for you tobuild an AI data Foundationfirst it starts with interconnecting allyour datastructured and unstructured in anyformat across all locationsthe second step is to bring AI to yourdata so you can securely and quicklybuild AI models with itand third to boost your productivitywith AI helping data teams to analyzedata generate code and to optimize yourdata workloadsthis AI data Foundation is Google's dataand AI cloudso let us start with the first step withinterconnecting all your data yourworkloads are increasing new fileformats more unstructured data acrosscloudsand on-premise systems and we hear youthere are just too many tools for you tolearn and to navigate in betweendata is spread over tens sometimeshundreds of data silos and every AIproject is really a data project indisguisebut there is a better wayyou need the Simplicity of bigquery tointerconnect all of your databigquery enables you to managestructured and unstructured data withfine-grained access controls across allclouds but without you moving the databigquery enables you to analyze andsmoothly work with all of the major opensource file formatsself-managed data lakes and Google'shigh performance bigquery storagebigquery also enables you to connectlarge-scale data sets with real-timedata streamsinterconnecting all your dataspecifically means going Beyondstructured data records the majority ofthe data out there is what it'sunstructured and the majority of thatdata is never analyzed yet gen AI holdsenormous potential for analyzing bothstructured and unstructured data it is akey step in your data journey to makesense of this unstructured data be itimages Voice documents you have toanalyze it and combine it with yourstructured data records this ultimatelyunlocks the real 360 degree insightsinto your businessthis is why we have just make big lakeobject tables generally availableand there they are to easily accessTraverse process and query unstructureddata in bigqueryand we also announced today that Generalavailability in Big Lake for the hoodieand Delta file formatbig lake has seen hyper growth justsince the beginning of this year BigLake usage has seen a 27-fold increasein usage and todaywe are taking big lake one step furthertoday I am thrilled to announce thepreview of fully managed Iceberg tablesin Big Leagueso you can use high throughput streamingI love the spirit of that highthroughput streaming and ingestion onall of your Google Cloud Storage datayou get a fully managed experience foryour lake house with storageoptimizations built in and you canperform DML transactions and useconsistent modifications and getimproved security for your Iceberg tabledata all while retaining full Icebergreader compatibilitybutinterconnecting all your data doesn'tstop at a boundary of a cloud does itmany of our customers are wanting toanalyze and to manage data in AWS or inazurethis is why we are taking bigquery Omnito the next level and today we areannouncing bigquery Omni for cross-cloudmaterialized views and cross-cloud joinsinterconnecting all of your data doesn'tstop at any Cloud really does itso today we are also extending oursupport for analytics to on-premisewe are bringing data proc spark toGoogle's distributed cloudnow with this you can run dataproc sparkon sensitive data in your data centersto Support Compliance or datasovereignty requirements and you caninterconnect it with your bigquery datain Google Cloudinterconnecting all your data also meansthat you need to have a data governanceand data management that goes from theingestion of data to the processing tomodel training up to model deploymentwe have just added intelligent dataprofiling to dataplex and thosecapabilities help you to understand thecompleteness the accuracy and thevalidity of your data and today weannounced extended support in datablacks for data management andgovernance covering vertex AIusers will get a single pane of glassfor all of your data and your AI assetsincluding vertex AI models and data setsoperational databases and all youranalytical data on gcpthis is the first step of Google's dataand AI Cloud interconnecting all yourdatalet us go to the second steplet us talk about bringing AI to yourdata this means making AI easilyaccessible to all your data teams andmaking it effortless for you to makeyour data accessible to AI models todrain and deploy themthis makes the development of AI reallysecure fast and simplerour customers already are runninghundreds of millions of machine learningpredictions in bigquery todayin just the last six months mloperations in bigquery have grown morethan 250 percent compared to last yearand today we are taking the next step bybringing generative AI to your bigquerydata today we are announcing the abilityto access vertex AIS Foundation modeldirectly from bigquerywith just a single statement you canconnect a bigquery table with a largelanguage model in vertexand you can tune and use prompts withall of your big query datathis allows you to use gen AIcapabilities such as text analysis onyour data or generate new attributes foryour table data in bigquery with just afew clicks you can use the vertex stockAI workbench to build a personalized llmextractor which then can be directlyaccessed from bigquery to extractspecific Knowledge from your dataFaraday is a leading customer predictionplatform and they previously had tomanage multiple data pipelines docomplex joints over multiple data setsand now not only can they simplify theirsentiment analysis but they can takealso the customer sentiment join it withadditional customer attributes and feedit right back into a large languagemodel to get hyper personalized contentand all of that Within bigquerybringing AI to your data also meansembracing the ecosystem of pre-drainedmodels and machine learning Frameworksand today here comes a big one we areannouncing that channel availability ofbigqueries machine learning inferenceengineforeigncustomer you can run predictions onGoogle Cloud Vision natural language andtranslation models you can import modelsin formats like tensorflow Lite Onyx orXJ boost and you can use directly modelshosted in vertex AIand to bring AI to your data we madebigquery the place to store all of yourml features and vector embeddingsthis is why we are announcing today thebig query preview feature of featuretables and Vector embedding indexesby loading your feature and Vector datainto bigquery you can do powerfulsemantic searches you can runrecommendation queries all at the scaleof your bigquery data and you can manageyour features as you manage the same wayas you manage your other dataand plus we will automaticallysynchronize your feature data inbigquery with vertex AI feature store toenable low latency serving in your webapplications but without having youmoving the databringing AI to your data also meansbringing the teams together who areworking on AI and data in a sharedenvironmentand we are excited to announce thepreview of our brand new and superawesome bigquery Studiobigquery studio is now a place wheredata engineering analytics and machinelearning can be brought together in oneenvironmentand customers like herb make it now fastand easy for the data and AI teams towork smoothly together across the fulldata life cyclebigquery Studio allows you to write SQLpython Frameworks like spark and otherlanguages and run it on the petabytescale of your data but without anyadditional infrastructure managementoverheadand to all of the Python coders outthere I assume there are some I hopethere are somewhen we say bringing AI to your datathis also means a simple way for you torun python for data science directly inbigquery and today we are announcing thepreview of our big query data frame APIwith bigquery data frames you can usefamiliar apis for pandas or scikit-learnand prepare terrain on and score datainside of bigquery and leverage thescale of our serverless infrastructureyeahand of courseyou know bigquery Studio you know whenyou write potent code in it you want tohave the best awesome notebookexperience that possibly can bethis is why bigquery Studio gives youdirect access to collab Enterpriseit is a new offering that bringsGoogle's Cloud security and complianceto collaband to provide you flexibility andchoice at the same point in time we arealso deepening our Partnerships withfacts deep node and super tour fornotebooksbringing AI directly to your data andbigquery is the second step in Google'sdata and AI cloudsolet us go to the third steplet us go to Bringing AI to your dataFoundation by using generative AI toanalyze codegenerate code analyze your data andoptimize your data workloadsGoogle cloud is built with the leadingAI modelsand duet AI is our collaborativeexperience that helps you work on gcpI am thrilled to announce the preview ofduet AI in big queryduet AI can assist you with writing SQLand python code and allowing you tofocus more on logic and outcomesit auto suggests code in real time whenit generates full functions and codeblocks for youand it helps you through your data workwith a chat based experiencewe also brought two at AI to our datamigration service to help you modernizeyour legacy application throughautomatic SQL translationsand now with duet AI in bigquery datacompanies at companies like L'Oreal theycan gain chat and code collaboration tospeed up all of their data workwe are also brought two ADI to datablacksToyota and dataplex can be used formetadata inside to solve what we callthe cold start problemhow do you knowwhich questions you can ask of your dataleveraging duet AI we help you jumpstart your analytics with a generatedlist of questions based on your data andhow this data is being usedand now with one click access you canturn those questions into SQL theoriesin the new Big query Studiowe also took it one step further onhelping you to analyze your datamore than 10 million users access lookerevery monthand they gain deeper insights from over1 000 data sources and more than 800Community connectorsand now it's time to bring generative AIto business AnalyticsI am fired up to announce two at AI forlookerallows to do two conversational dataanalysis in natural languagedo that AI looker can automaticallygenerate dashboards and reports by youtelling local the goals of your analysisduet Ai and looker can generate Googleslides for you so you can take it to thenext meeting and discuss your findingswith your colleaguesyou can use natural language to createvisualizations and calculationsand you can rapidly build data models inlook ml by just telling look at theintent of your data modelour vision for Looker has always been toreduce the time between insights andactionsimagine being able to chat with yourdata re-imagine what repot or dashboardgeneration could be and reimagine howdecision makers get to the right answersin the right moment and in the rightformatbringing generative AI to help datateams is the third step in Google's dataand AI cloud and now I think it's timewe take a look at how bigquery and lookat the AI data Foundation look like inaction please welcome from Googledeveloper relations Json Davenporttake it away Chase thank you Garrettso many great launches to help ouranalysts engineers and scientists getmore done with Google's data cloudI'm excited to share how all thesefeatures will come together in a videowalkthrough today which I recorded overthe weekend just in case I had anytechnical difficultiesworking to build insights on anyplatform is the goal of this video todayand we'll be stepping through it to seethis come to life for manufacturingplantfirst I'll open my dashboardfor my plant application powered andlookerand here we can see that we have anissue in one of our sites so we're goingto go ahead and click into thatall rightwe're pulling up and the first thingwe're going to do is notice that we havea problem and specifically in throughputso as we start to look around we can seethat we have a dip at the hour of 2 pmnow with Toyota and looker we're goingto bring AI to our dataso let's learn why throughput is downwhy did throughput drop at 2 pmall right we can see here so knowingcontext is really important in thisscenario and what do I just thoughtfullydone is suggest recommendations for mebecause it understands the question thatI asked and all the things about my datain order to make sure that it can givethe right answers backand in a few turns we can see that wehave some machine issues here are somepress machine failures and then someinventory overflows so we can go aheadand start working on that fixnow this is really helpful and withthroughout duet I probably would havehad to take some engineering time inorder to actually get to this answersince the data wasn't readily availableultimately though because this isreactive what we want to do is beproactive in our dashboard and actuallyrecommend actions for us to go useso with that we need to build a modelthat predicts our downtime and then putit on here so we can actually avoid thisgoing forwardso let's go ahead and get working tobuild this using our single simpleunified environment bigquery Studiohere we can build anything that we wantincluding in Pythonso let's go ahead and get to thisfirst I'll see what data I already haveavailablehere we can see that I have a data setthat's in Google cloud and then anotherdata set that's in AWSthere's a throughput table that lookspromising to use as a starting pointwhat I need to do though is I need tovalidate that this data is actually goodbecause it needs to go into my model andI need to make sure my model is highqualityso let's go ahead and open thethroughput tablelet's go ahead and open the table thankyou all rightnow I can see here I'm on the dataprofiling tab that I can perform somelightweight data analysis right out ofthe boxand next I need to make sure that thisdata is actually governed well or it hashigh quality and we can see that we havequality checks already in place so Iknow that this data is maintainedalso because we're using duet AI it'salready analyzing our data and all thequeries that we've done before this sowhat we can do is use insights toactually suggest business questions toour userslet's open one of these queries inbigquery to see one of the insightsit's really cool for this because whatwe're doing is I just had the questionand I could immediately start to seethings about my data that are reallyusefulall rightnow we need to actually build our modeland to do that we're going to need a fewmore data features and it looks like ourAWS data set has some data features thatare going to be useful for ussince we're going to be building our mlmodel though I'm going to do this in aJupiter notebookso let's make sure we can do this tocollaborate more effectivelyall right here we're going to as thenotebook opens ask duet AI to help usbuild a modeland with this model we'll be generatinga multi-cloud query for us to bring ourdata together and then predict ourthroughput based on the attributes thatwe have of our dataand it can also detect my spellingerrors because I am not a good spellersometimesall right with that we have our SQLquery and we can see here that we cancreate our model with that also downtoward the bottom we have our join so wejust joined all this data from multipleclouds in a single simple jointoperation and there's nothing morecomplexier than what we haveall right so doing AI is really helpingme not just code faster but it's alsohelping me get to my insights evenfasterso let's go ahead and start gettingthese business questions answered in away that really works well for usso I need to make sure that my modelwill actually run we have this model butit's based on this table and it's notbased on my data streamin the same notebook here what we'regoing to do is mix programming languagesand start using pythonfirst we'll use a few lines of code hereand what we'll do is actually see ourmodel predicting in real time againstour production data so we know that thisdata is ready for our productionenvironment and this model specificallyand since these predictions are a greatstart what I want to think about now ishow I can actually give my re give myplant operators recommendations for whatto do because ultimately if they know itthey can go do immediately forpreventative maintenance the plant willbe even betterso we have some unstructured data forthis that reside somewhere else and whatwe're going to do is pull that inwe're going to use what's calledretrieval augmented generation which isa really really big set of words andjust means that we're going to actuallyuse our data to build tools for an llmin order to help build an even betterresponse that's grounded and has moresafety in it to reduce hallucinationsand it seems honestly like sometimes alot but we can do it here with just afew lines to really bring it to lifefirst let's do this and bring our AI tobigqueryso using llms powered by vertex AIwe're going to actually connect allthese these data points together in ourmodels we're going to summarize all ofthis and we're going to create numericalrepresentations of our summaries orvectors to help with these searches andgroupingsnext we're going to pass a question intothe oom which will help us get ourvector and the summary of the closestthing that was related to thatthis will then use to actually get ourprompt we'll pass that in and then we'llget our recommendation for what ourusers should actually go do in order tomake the plant work better and in thiscase making sure that our employees areproperly trained on how the garage doorshould open and what happens when theydisconnect the powerthis would have taken us a lot of timeand data scientists in order to actuallymake this happen and here we just did itin a matter of minutes using generativeAI in bigquery and the benefit of thisis that all of our data remained inplace we brought compute to our data tokeep it secureall right we get this let's get ourpipeline deployedand now let's go back to our actual BigData application where we can seepredictive results coming throughand with the power of looker we can useactions to notify our plant Personnelthat they need to take actionall right so let's summarize today wewent from reactive to proactive usingthe data cloud and generative Ai and wemade it happen at scale using secureTechnologies and at scale across all ofour data we can't wait to see what youbuild with these new capabilities inyour data stackback to you Garrettthank you Jason what an awesomedemonstrationnowimagine what is possible in your futurewith the ability to unlock the potentialthat your data holdswhen all of your data is interconnectedwhen you can make AI easily available toall your data users when users can chatwith your dataand when data practitioners can harnessthe power of generative AIwe believe that your data it's the keyto unlock your AI transformationto continuously solve for what's comingnext and to innovate in your industryand this is why we are building with somuch passion Google's data and AI Cloudfor youand we are thrilled that we are joinedby over 1 000 software Partners who arepowering their applications withGoogle's data and AI Cloud to help youon your data Journeybut now it's time to
