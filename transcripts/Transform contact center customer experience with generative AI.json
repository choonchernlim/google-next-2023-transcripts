    "transcript": "foreign[Music]I was flipping through the slidesyesterdayand I was reflecting on the deck wouldhave been so different if it wasprepared literally just 10 months agoand the Jenner Revolution that we've allbeen part of has really just transformedour product portfolio your expectationsand where the industry is headedum but one thing that actually has notchanged uh you know five years ago whenI actually co-founded contact center AIwe we were very sure about this industrybecause we knew this would be the firstadopter of AI and you know contactcenter was ripe for that and we've seenthat layout over five years and evenwith all the Gen AI it was I think onething that everyone agrees with is thatcontact center is literally the singlebiggest use case or at least the firstuse case that will come to market withthe Virginia Solutions I think we canall give ourselves a round of applausefor that uh for being literallyum so we haveum we have a packed session today we'lltry to squeeze out time for Q a at theend but if we don't manage to do thatyou can always catch us at the boothdownstairsum so I'm shantanu I'm a group productmanager with our contact center AI teamum I have with me Mina my colleague wholeads go to market solution for for allof ccai and Beyond we have with us twocustomers who are going to be talkingabout their Journey with Google we haveAlex from gen digital who's going to betalking about being an early adopter ofCCI platform and how now they'redoubling down on Google and swarup fromWells Fargo is going to be talking aboutthe Fargo Journey which was you know aconversational AI solution that theydeveloped with Googleumso we're going to be covering a lot oftopicsumas I said you know we have a packedagenda but we'll try to squeeze insometime towards the end for Q a as wellum if you think about contact centersthe the pain points are basically thesame as we have seen over the yearswhich is users are frustrated uh theydon't want to wait in Long queues uh wehave huge agent turnover you know 30 40percent of the agents quit their job inthe first year itself so we have hugeonboarding time and we need to sort ofempower the agent to handle complexquestionsum and then you have contact centeredoperations which is trying to sort ofJuggle these different hats you knowtrying to increase Revenue while alsolowering cost and designing thiscustomer experience just takes monthsand quarters so all those problems likeif you're able to present this slidethree years ago it'll basically besimilar problems but I think what haschanged isthe expectationsum is the expectation that an end userhas when it reaches out to a businessbecause end users are now used to toolslike Bard and other tools in the marketwhere they can get these gen AI poweredanswers very quickly so they are notthey don't they have very little empathywhen businesses put them on hold for 10minutes or struggle to find an answer toa question which is very very easyand also what I have observed over thelast few months is that organizationsexpectations have changed as well likewe would go into again with the customerand we'll try to sort of create aconversational AI solution and it wastotally okay for us to spend six monthsdoing that but that's no longer the caseum we want solutions to start addingvalue day one onwards and you knoworganizations expect Google you knowanother providers to be able to matchthat expectationso when we think of ccai you know wereally think of that in sort of in termsof four broad pillarsum our approach is AI first and it hasbeen that since day oneum and you know in some ways theseproducts are arranged in sort of uhorder of you know when they actuallylaunched but also in terms of the userJourney you know you typically getstarted off with a virtual agent whichis powered by dialog flow uh you knowdialogue is is a solution that's been GAfor for five plus yearsum for each of these Solutions we'regoing to be talking about how we arecreating the Next Generation version ofthat powered by llmumafter dialogflow you know the call getsescalated to a human agent you haveagent assist which is a suite of toolswhich helps the agent answer thequestion better and you can imagine ifthe virtual agent is doing its jobreally really well it's really the toughquestions that end up with the liveagents and they really need to beempowered to handle those questionsum with CCI insights which is our thirdpillarwhat we're really trying to do is makesense of you know the dark data thatexists in your contact centers which isnot being used to take businessdecisions todayum and we believe with you knowuploading audio or transcripts using ourtranscription tools to do that and thentrying to make sense of that data canunlock a lot of value for businesses andwe have already seen that happening inmultiple customers with CCI insights andfinally CCI platform which we launchedlast year which is our ccast solutionand the whole idea behind CCI platformwas you know we had these great AIservices but our customers werestruggling with integrating it withtheir existing solutions they used to belong lead times and really wanted tocreate an AI firstccas solution where AI is not enough tothought we're getting access to Googlesolution is literally a click of abutton and we have seen huge successwith CCI platform and we we have gendigital is going to be talking moreabout it in a momentas you know and I think as Thomas curingand Sunder mentioned in their Keynotesour approach to gen AI is comprehensiveyou know so if you are a developer thatwants to play with the models or build acustom model you can use Solutions likevertex AI or model Garden to be able todo that if you want to if you wantaccess to an AI platform where you canyou know do Chrome tuning do evalsyou can do that with our AI platformwith ccai and similar Solutions whatwe're really trying to do ismake all of that complexity simpler foryou and present it to you in a way thatmakes sense for you so when it comes toyou know pricing it in a way that makessense for you or integrating it in a waythat makes sense for you or tuning theseAI models to make sure that they thatthey address your use cases reallyreally wellI'm going to be talking more about seaservices and specifically about what arethe new things we are bringingum to you when we're announcing todaywhich are powered by llms which reallyElevate the experienceand I wanted to play this videojust to give you a glimpse of that[Music]thank you[Music]all right[Music]foreign[Music]thank youI know there's a lot in there but we'regoing to sort of unpack that over thecourse of this presentation and reallytalk about what are the tools that weare providing you to create anexperience like thatum so you know as I mentioned you knowvirtual agents powered by dialogue flowyou know we dialogue for CX we reallyprovide you with a comprehensive Suitethrough which to develop the virtualagent experience you know when it comesto handling detoursgracefully handling fallbacksum you know with dollar for CX you canhandle all of that and do debugginganalytics and everything that comes withit but really want to focus on today iswhat are the new things that we arebringing to the marketum and you know all these three areinitiatives that we've been working onfor a while powered by llm andgenerative AI the first one is what wecall the generative AI agentum which you know we also refer to it assometimes as infobots uh which isbasicallycreating a virtual agent experience justby linking a source of informationso you literally just link you know yourwebsite FAQs uh to uh the virtual agentand you can have a conversational AIexperience with it so it's literally atthe click of a button and what we'veseen in a lot of use cases where in thepast our customers would have translatedtheir existing business knowledge intodialogflow CX graphs you don't need todo that anymore you can just link thosedocuments and it's it works out of thewayum and you know we're announcing this inGA today this has already been inproduction with multiple previewcustomers I'm sure a lot of you haveprobably had access to this as wellum and and I'm going to talk more aboutlater about how this is also poweringthe agent facing experience and makingthat better as wellthe second key launch we have in virtualagent is what we call generativeresponsesso essentially uh today if you thinkabout it every single thing that yourvirtual agent can say has to be writtenin you know whatever virtual agentsolution you're using but withgenerative AI we can actually helpgenerate those responses and we can dothat at the pace that you're comfortablewith so if you're comfortable the botspeaking generator AI responses only incase of a fallback you can set that aswell or for a given fulfillment you canspecify so you have full control overwhen the generative part of theresponses takethe third key launch we have is what wecall generative flows which is launchingin preview todaywhich is basically saying that you canwrite in natural language in Englishwhat the bot is supposed to do and willdo that so for example if you have a usecase you know of menu ordering you knowI'm sure a lot of you have seen theWendy's Booth downstairs which isexactly the same use case you canliterally mention the menu and say heyvirtual agent you're supposed to behavelike a very courteous uh you know agentwho can take orders from this menu youcan Define the person or the way youwant and we have templates for that andthat's it you don't have to go ahead andcreate sort of thousands of intents andpages and flows and go through all thateffortand really the theme that we're tryingto hit on with this is the ultimateagent the virtual agent that goes intoproduction is a much simpler graph thanwhat you're used to you know in the pastwe have had you know some of our uhPower users will create you knowthousands of intents and Pages becausethey needed to do that you literallyneeded to teach your virtual agent howto speak English uh but now you canreally focus on the business rules andon the content of what the agent issupposed to talk about and not worryaboutum you know these scenarios which end upsort of consuming a lot of yourdevelopment time and a lot of sort ofthe agent size as wellthe other thing I wanted to emphasize isthis comes as part of dialogue flow sowe know most of the people in this roomare already on a journey with dialogflowyou don't have to replace all of thatwith this new experience you can startaugmenting uh your existing dialogflowvirtual agent with elements ofgenerative Ai and that's very importantbecause depending on the industrydepending on you know uh what kind of anexperience you want for your end usersyour appetite for how generate howgenerative the responses should be mightbe very different and you get to decidewhich elements of your virtual agent arepowered by these Technologies versuswhich uh you know rely on the existingdollar for CX technologyuh we're also announcing dialogueso-called companion interview and andit's you know what you saw in the videowith the multimedia inputum dollar for call Companion Powers itwhich is basically while a voice call isgoing on can we give an experience tothe end user where they have actuallyhave on their browser on their phone orvisual menu as well using which theycould navigate uh your ivrsI wanted to spend some time on agentassist so agent assist as I mentioned isa suite of featuresthat we have to empower your agents tomake them more productivewe are announcing today two new featuresknowledge assist which is uh launchingin previewand as I mentioned it's you should thinkof this as the generative AI agent orthe infobot for your live agent so youknow think of two scenarios your agentis in a conversation with the end userand they could they have an agent onwhich they could search for answersbut we actually want to elevate thatexperience and proactively providesuggestions to the agent while theconversation is going on so the agentdoes not even need to search for itbased on the conversation that's goingon our generative AI knowledge assistcould tell them hey it seems the user isasking about this this informationalready exists in the documents here yougo and made that experience better forthemnext summarizationis such a key a key sort of end of callactivity that happens for some customersliterally at the end of each call we'vehad customers who spend whose agentsspend 90 seconds at the end of the callto summarize the conversation and youknow fill all of that information in thesystem of recordwe have been able to bring that timedown to near zero and llm generatedsummary is better at compliance whichmeans every single call actually getssummarized you know in with your liveagent sometimes they do not summarizeand you have all sorts of summaries indifferent formatsum it's better of course at spelling andmaking sure that it's it's actually youknow human readable and understandableand and in terms of quality we have seenthe llm Baseline summarization to be youknow as good as the human summarizationand you know you don't have to create acustom model you don't have to spendthree months trying to create somethingwhich is only for yourself you can useour LM summarization and get that jobdone and something which has seen a lotof success over the last few months asorganizations have started adoptinggenerative AICCI insights as I said tries to makesense of conversational data that youalready have in your system the way wedo that isis having annotations for thisconversational data so what are the keytopics being discussed in theconversations what are the key questionsthat the users are asking about you knowcan we summarize the conversation andinsights itself how can we understandwhat are the key words which matter toyou or key phrases and highlight thatfor youand what do we do with that we we createcustom metrics or aggregated metricsdepending on your use case so forexample if you have a quality managementuse case where you want to create anAsian level dashboard you can do thatwith these metricsum or you know you you want to reallyunderstand what are the key topics forvirtual age and with our topic modelingyou can figure out which of the topicswhich are being discussed and are simpleenough for the virtually you can designyour Asian training based on theinsights that you glean from thiswe are announcing today generative fhuas part of insights in previewand what that does is really extract thekey questions from your conversationso you want to understand hey I have youknow these millions of conversationsthat flow through my system what are thequestions that our users are reallyasking and is my FAQ is my agenttraining is my virtual agent programaligned with that or not and that hasbeen very meaningful for customersbecause they're like oh I didn't evenrealize that there are X number ofquestions that our users are asking forbecause I thought you know my FAQ wasrobust and comprehensive or my agentagent Pro training program was completeand that's how uh generative FAQ isreally being used to to make it moreDynamic instead of sort of once a yearor once or two year process of figuringout what those FAQs would beI want to spend some time talking aboutCCI platform because as I said we'vebeen very excited about this program welaunched it last year and since then wehave had you know thousands of Agentsonboarded on CCI platformum it has the message that we weretrying to convey to the industry hasresonated really really well withcustomers and analystsum so what we're really doing is as Isaid bringing an AI first approach toccast instead of AI as an afterthoughtwe are trying to ensure that all of theGen AI llm driven capabilities that aretalked about are available on day one onCCI platform so you know we have youknow you might have your contacts in theprovider taking whatever six months 12months to integrate with Google but withGoogle CCI you can just get it on dayone itselfum and it's it's also developed CCIplatform code develops these llmcapabilities along with the AI servicesso that that integration itself is verysmooth and is not you know hacky or youknow just appears bolted onwe're also with CCR platform we werealso very keen on providing customerswith TurnKey Solutions which areextendable so you know you you have alot of ccast cloud first layers in themarket should provide you tools but thenyou need to create an entire Army ofdevelopers uh you know working on it formultiple months to spin up you know agood experience for you with with CCIplatform you want to make sure that youalready have uh you know these TurnKeySolutions or none key sort of templatesthat could get you started on day oneitselftoday we are announcing an Iva onlyversion of CCI platform we understandyou know that you know sometimes youmulti-year deals and getting out ofmoving from an on-prem contact center toa cloud contact center can be amulti-year journey and we understandthat and that's why we created cpcciplatform IBA only option which gives youa way to consume all of our gen AIServices by having a light touchpipeline going from your existingcontact center to Google CC Ai and youknow we can work with whateverinfrastructure you have and really giveyou access to Genia Servicesum as as soon as possiblewe're also announcingworkforce management capabilities in CCIplatform today and and as I said ouridea with CCR platform is to be ascomprehensive as possible and our wfmannouncement is a key piece of that youknow when it comes to schedulingforecasting adherence all the things Ican imagine in a wfm system all of thatcomes native as part of CCI platform andif you think about itI talked about insights and trying toglean metrics and annotations out ofeach every single conversation now thatcan actually feed into your wfoSolutions and really make it more muchmore powerful and much more Dynamic thanit used to beagain we work with your existing wfm andqm providers as well we're announcing apartnership with variant and alvariawhere if you have these Solutions CCIplatform can seamlessly integrate withthatso I'm now going to hand it over to minawho's our GTM lead who's going to talkmore about how we are bringing thesesolutions to market for you thank yougood morning everybody[Music]generic conversation is always very dearto me guess what in 2020 the elementmodel we were building at Google wasalso called Minaso I want to start off by taking you allback in time a few years ago we had adream a dream to transform the contactsinto spaceand in this dream we envisionedpersonalized predictive and memorableconversations elevating the self-servicespacewe thought about very happy superproductive human agents loving what theydo right and being powered and coachedby AI models on the Flythe envisioned business intelligence aswell as insights being actionable andbeing offered to contact center leadersto make the toughest business decisionsand we wanted to orchestrate all of thisvia a ccas platform that's designed forscale so security and speed now as youall are aware as we heard from shantanuwe've had this life for a while nowbut this Vision got even grander becauseccai is going to be the launch vehicleto bring enterprise-ready generative AIsuperpowering customer experiencesso how do we make this real for youso our focus is on choice andflexibility one you get to use theentire platform right with its fullend-to-end offerings or two you get toconsume the latest and greatest ofgenerative AI we are your Partnershipswith oems or thirdly as shantana justannounced you can use the CCI platformas a lightweight conduit powering thelatest and greatest of generative AI onyour legacy infrastructureso with this choice and flexibility inmind here is how a transformationJourney could look likewith our resilient focus on time toMarket we have come up with three valuepackagesso from day one to four weeks you canget info Bots powered by generative AIup and running you can have agentsummarizations enabled just like thedemo that you saw around simple bikesand you can have insights topic modelingup and running giving you insights intoyour call drivers and intense so that'sweek four from week four to week 12could be a great time to get chatinvoice enabled for agent assist as wellas start you know augmenting andpotentially replacing some of yourspeech applicationsthirdly as you enter into month threeand onwards this is the time for you tobring in all of those transactionalintents as well as leverage customer MLMmodeling for your unique business casesso a transformation Journey like thisbetween day 0 to about three months andonwards can only be enabled when we havea large partner ecosystemso I'm super excited to share with youall that we have

systems workforce managementcontact flows and AI automation acrossall of our brandswe recently Consolidated onto a contactsolution to Google's contact center AIplatformand so so why did we choose Googleat gen we believe that AI Services applytothe contact center spaceon an end-to-end platform would dominatecustomer servicewe will believe that that wouldtransform the customer and agentexperienceand LeapFrog the industryJen neededa solution that supportedintegrated AIa real-time machine translation languagetranslatoracross all channels including voicewe wanted a bring your own

rapid Innovationpartner up with a leader in this spaceso how did the implementation goyou know we have over 7 000 phonenumbers domestic and international300 plus call flows2 000 plus agentsmultiple carriers10 plus delivery locationsoh sorry about that I forgotintroduction uh10 plus delivery locations and 21languagesacross all of our brands we haveexperience for multiple telephony chatand CRM providerswe we have experience from every type ofcontact center environmenton premiseinfrastructure to service platform as aservice software as a service we trythem allbased on our experience the time that ittakes to migrate one just one singlevoice platformtakes anywhere between seven months toone year and that's provided that youhave a seasoned crew that that this crewowns product development operations andinfrastructure and developmentwith ccipwe deliver not only onebut two celebrity migrationin four and a half monthsso basically we received our environmentfreshly formattedin mid-april and that's this mid-aprilof 2023we and we started the row out to all ofour contact centers beginning of Augustand we completed the last one last nightuh so with so with previous migrationsthis would have takenapproximately two yearsso one of our our key business kpisare service level average handle time Qtime wait time calls handlewe were able to reach stabilitywithin the first one to two weeks prettyamazingand and this is really a a a phenomenalindication that you know our agents aretrained they're familiar with the youththe new UIthey understand the new processes uh wehave our agent profile profilescorrectly configured and migrated and wehave called sprouted into the right cuesso how will we even accomplish this featso we partnered with T-Tech a premiersystem integrator for Googleand and T-Techhas their own contact center BPObusinessthat is currently also adopting Googleccipso they have to get this rightokayum our partnership with Googlegave us an opportunity to adjustprioritiesof the the critical features that weneeded at genthere were some gapsthat there was absence of Gap but a bitheroin and the product team at Googledid as a solidwe were able to influence the roadmapand quickly close the gaps and meet ourtimelinesso additionally we're also in theprocess of looping chat which weestimated we completed in three to fourmonths which is another record for usso so what's so what's for the impact toour businesswell we realize our Synergy goalsa reduction in platform andinfrastructure costsuh Google's Voice network architecturegives you the ability to Ingressthe customer callat the closest point to the customersend it over Google's high-speed Networkand egressto call to the to the to the closest tothe agent's clientand what that resulted itit's

as it is what gaand we needed a conversation engine thatwas portablewe didn't we didn't want to be in aposition where we where we had torebuild all of our automationand from scratch and since and since wetransitioned the dialogue flow wemigrated our chat platforms three timesand in every instances we did not needto redo our automationwe we get about 30 containment fromvoice and 40 percent from chatso the Google SAS model gives us abilityto try out new features without all theupfront investment and commitmentslooker bigqueryvertex AI agent assistsspeech to text sentimentthis this onesowhat's nextwhat is the future what what's in storefor gender in the futureso there's been a lot of conversation atthis conference about vertex AIfor Jen we are interested in AIto assist our customersand our agentsso at the end of every contact agentsspends several minutes to summarize thecase and to classify the type of calloperationally we want to get to agranular case typebut what we found out is that the longerthe list we make the agents just choosethe first option from the listsowe believe that we can leverage vertexAi and agent assist to significantlyreduce the time that it takes tosummarize and

solutionsthat have complete vertical integrationand it's at the Forefront of AIwe plan to take full use of Google'sinnovationnow that our contact center is platformis tightly coupled with the Googletechnology stackthat includes Google Cloudlooker insights bigquery vertex Ai anddialog flowso I I would like to thank the team anentire gen consumer support organizationand inside sales organization my team TTech and Google for the teamwork thatrealize our vision uh and if anyone elsetells you you cannot transform yourcontact center platform quickly give mea callall right thank you for your timethank youCTO of[Applause]thanks Alexum one of the advantages of going lastis like I get to say the final words butalso feels very familiar to the world welive in uh three minutes faster deliveryum very much summarizes what we wentthrough so I'll quickly go through ourdigital transformation that wasprimarily enabled through dialogue flowand the contact center technologies thatGoogle offersone of the big challenge istraditionally every bank is looked at asslow pace change and Wells Fargo is a173 year old bank so we were looking atnot just accelerating but leapfroggingto more modern experiences to keep upwith our customer experiences because weare holding ourselves to higherstandards from a digital experiencestandpoint uh and want to have a digitalparity of providing a similar familiarexperience to the best digitalexperience the customer prior to yourlanding on the Wells Fargo mobile appwith that we started off with like somefounding principles around making itsimplified personalized and insightfuland as we went through this journey wepartnered with Google as a part of ourstrategic partnershipum it was publicly announced that we uhwe are partnering with Google totransform our entire infrastructure andmove our strategic AI assets and dataassets into the Google Cloudand one of the first uh use case that westarted off was the most complex oneum which was Fargo and I'll quickly likerun through some of the things thatFargo can do andas as it plays there's no music but I'lltry to talk toFargo is our virtual assistant that waslaunched about uhuh four months ago in partnership withGoogle behind the scenes there's thedialogflow agentbut the whole idea was to make theentire mobile interactions through ourapp very familiar uh little less Bankspeak but very naturaland with few tenants that are you knowhighly engaging from a customerstandpoint so for example if you had tolook up your Financial Healthuh or get to the transactions fasterwhich by the way is the most usedfeature on our app todayum and also any of these steps that youcould imagine with any of your you knowbanking app that you use these tend tobe multi-step uh and we are trying toreduce that amount of time you spend inyou knowliving in a banking World nobody wakesup in the morning saying Hey I want todo banking we want to kind of take thatfriction awayand most importantly we also want to getto personal insights uh or repeat ofthem this is not the ccai insightsthat's for different operators this isfor the userssoum bottom line I think you know we'velaunched this and we you know everybodyhere uh we've had several Partners fromGoogle and the whole ecosystem of teamsit definitely does take a villageum to get something out there and thisalso happens to be our firstuh use case on our Google Cloud virtualprivate Cloud that we had started off somany learnings many takeawaysand in terms of the Fargo Evolutionitself one of the things that connectsback to everything shantini was talkingabout in how we look at evolving theexperience but also tying back to everytechnologyenhancement that is happeningwhat we would uh take this forward isfrom an assistant to an advisor kind ofan experience where over a period oftime these are done for the customers asopposed to them wanting to go into anapp and spending time uh some time doingthis activitiesjust to quickly go through uh this iskind of our high level blueprint andwhere dialogflow sits todaywe were very intentional in how we builtthis one out unlike the contact centerexperiences this is a digital and amobile experience and we modulized everybuilding block uh with some foundingprinciples around Security Firstresiliencyand as you can imagine from a mobilestandpoint the number one uh adoptionFactor would be the response times so wehad to make sure that the entireplatform was extremely resilient and hadextremely fast response times as welland since this was our first array intoa going out of our data centers into aGoogle data center it wasn't fun but wehad a lot of learnings from thatokayum that's all my with my time but onetakeaway if you're if you're a WellsFargo customer and if you have notalready engaged with Fargo pleasedownload the app please go to Fargo uhprovide your feedback and connectingback to shantanu this is just theJourney of where we are uh and we areclosely partnering with Google AroundThe Trusted tested program uh toconstantly look at where we can plug inall the New Gen AI capabilities into ourproduct thank youforeign"
