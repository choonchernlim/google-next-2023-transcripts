infinitepossibilitiesCS offers a full catalog of services andIndustry SolutionsTCS continues to be a leader in buildingthe best team of Google Cloud trainedand certified talent to meet our clientsneeds leveraging our g-school LearningAcademyTCS has been recognized by Google cloudwith numerous Awards over the yearsrealize your true business potentialhow will you innovate to reimagine yourfutureplease welcome to the stage needysrivastava of TCSgood morninguh and first and foremost welcomewelcome to this session where we aregoing to share with you the fascinatingstory of how CME Groupis transforming the derivativesmarketplace with TCS and Google Cloudum I'm sure you'll have a reallyinteresting and engaging time andjoining me today will be our panelistsso let me start theintroductionfor the lineup toa fairly perfect panelokay so if I can welcome Kiran panjamanaging director and head of cloud anddata at the CME Group welcome Kiranthank you great to have you hereand joining us today we have Aristudnitzer he's the managing directorfor post trade and risk Ari so good tohave you heremy fellow colleagues from Chicago fromThe Windy City of Chicago all right andmanojpura head of cloud customerexperience for the CME Group and amanaging director so good to see youlikewiseso Gentlemen please make yourselvescomfortableall right so we are at Google Cloud nextand it's all about the cloudand very recently we at TCS did a globalCloud studyand some of the findings that came outof that study should not be a surpriseto any one of us but actually it's avalidationthe first is the fact that cloudcontinues to be the source of innovationand any and every company strategyis incomplete if it does not have acloud strategywhat is cloud really delivering it isdeliveringnew business modelsthe ability to launch new products andservicesat a very very accelerated timeline andmost importantly improve customerexperienceto be able to do that what are companiesinvesting inand what we found is that about 86percent of the respondentssaid that they are investing in buildingstrong data and analytics community ofpractice so data and analytics will bevery key from a talent perspective aswell as from a modernization perspectiveand getting ready to ride the tsunamifor AI and machine learning and ofcourse 78 of the respondents said thatthey are setting up investments in a bigway to ride the wave on AIso this experience that we will sharetoday from the CME Group along withGoogle Cloud will help youtake awayapproaches strategies and also LessonsLearnedto build and accelerate yourtransformation programso if I may come to you Kiran my firstquestion is can you speak a little bitabout the vision that you had at the CMEGroup for this transformationthank you nidi so before we get into thevision for CME Group I want to providethe audience a little bit of context ofwhat CME Group is some of you might knowbut for those who don't CME Group is a175 year old companythat is uh managed to stay relevant inthe financial services Community byconstantly innovating and transformingto meet the customer needs so at thispoint it's the world's largestderivatives exchange and two years agoour leadership team decided that thatwasn't good enoughlooking at the disruption in thefinancial services markets caused byfintech and caused by changing socialexpectationsof what customers and companies wantedfrom financial services companies wedecided that we needed to set ourselvesto innovated pace and we entered into astrategic partnership with Google Cloudsowhat are we wanting to achieve out ofthis partnershipso the first thing is today the barrierof Entry to trade with CME Group is highso we want to lower the barrier entry wewant to make it more easier for moretraders to trade on CMEwe also recognizing that as youmentioned uh data and makingdecisions based on data is becoming animportant thing that's true for ourcustomers as well so we want tomodernize our data platform and providethose insightful data analyticscapabilities to our customers so theycan make real-time decisions and changetheir strategies or understand theirrisk posturesuhand obviously getting leveraging publicCloud leveraging agile methodologieswe're going to be able to increase ourpace of innovation and also since Simisits in the middle of the tradingecosystemus getting to a more resilient uh Placeactually increases the resilience in thefinancial services Market fair enoughfair enoughso we we do have a cool video which wewill play before we go into the Q a foryou to show how this whole story comestogether and that will reinforce for youthe level of sponsorshipand Leadership attention that we have atthe CME Group soum Ari I'll come to you now so you knowwe heard from Kieran the division andobjectives for the transformation so nowlet's come to the Brass tax you know thethe cool part how do you make it happenso can you elaborate on the solution andthe approach that you've taken toimplement this Grand Vision yeah for forus it really starts with our customersuh you know I think we often talk aboutbusiness value but embedded within thatis really what it takes to be able todrive new value for our customers whereare you going to be able to driveInnovation where are you going to enablea better customer experience andultimately what are of those productsthat are going to drive New Growth sofor us as we looked at our portfolio ofapplications we really try to hone in onfundamentally where are we going todrive that value and that was ourrefactors that was a relatively smallnumber of applications and products buta large percentage of our budgetand that's where we started butfundamentally it doesn't end there youreally have to look at the entireportfolio of applications technologydata that Karen was alluding to andreally understand how are you going tobe able to migrate that over because aswe all know it takes an entire ecosystemit's a network of fact having a fewapplications running and the cloud isnot going to drive the significant valuethat we want to achieve or you so as youthink about your portfolio you reallyhave to look at where those applicationsthat you can retire I think oftentimespeople think about what can you migratebut oftentimes don't really reflect onwhat are you going to retire let alonere-host and then finally be able tore-platform and start to take advantageof the various value but one of the keythings we learned is that you can't justfocus on the big picture you also needto think small and work incrementallyand one of the things we found was usingobjectives and key results okay oursreally helped us where you could have along-lived objective but really startsmall and think incrementally and holdeveryone accountable for that deliverythank you thank you so um Manoj as apartnerhow is Google Cloud enabling thismassive transformationso from the Inception as we think aboutthis relationshipthe we we know that within thispartnership Google cloud is recognizedvery clearly the opportunity to be ableto transform the derivatives MarketCME has obviously the one of the largestleading positions in this market and thequestion is is how we are going topartner Google cloud is going to partnerwith CME and TCS is going to partnerwith CME to be able to transform andcreate an impact on on the markets wesaw three large buckets of opportunitiesto partner and deliverat the onset of the opportunity first isabout modernization and grow so whatwhen we say that we are talking aboutmodernizing the IIT infrastructure weare talking about end-to-end life cyclefor deployment uh to be automatedobviously is pretty obviousum and and making sure that we'reprotectingum the uh CME and we are protecting cmis data and its customer and continue tomanage data very very effectively as asone can say that data is the new oil andit's important that we we put that datainto the appropriate use for uh for CMEand its customersso Google Cloud obviously providesbusinesses with all the tools andfunctionalities that you might haveenjoyed seeing yesterday in the keynoteum you know very well the question isthis how TCS and Google Cloud canpartner together with CME to be able toleverage all those capabilities fortransforming the marketswonderful sowith this we'veoff of the vision and and the role thatthe partners were playingso Kiran my question to you ishow have you been shippingand driving the data strategy at CMEbecause data is the new oil data is thenew gold you know whichever way we wantto look at it could you share some ofthe key elements of your data strategyyeah so uh the way we went about it iswe looked at a customer Viewpointoutside in and figured out what is ourcustomer doing with the data so we'reone of the data providers of Market datato trading uh entities and hedge fundsfinancial institutions Capital marketsend of the day data is used to get toAnalyticsso what we recognize is today when we wein other data providers provide datait's not readily usable to run analyticsthe data has to be curated sowe started the Journey of saying whatwhat do we need to do to make itanalytics readyso we started laying down a governanceframework so we can create datathat has the right attributes for it tobe searchable and has capabilities tounderstand who can use the data andwhere can they access the data theanthology of the data storage thelineage where it's coming from so youcan trust the data you're runninganalytics onso ourvision is to provide them analyticsready data and also maybe provide thebusiness insights directly as in termsof an analytics as a service so theydon't have to go to the process ofconsuming the data from the varioussources and then getting to the businessAnalyticsthat's a obviously a lofty goal we'renot the only player NATO player so weneed to figure out influence enough ofthe market participants and theexchanges so that they can startadopting and embracing the standardswe're putting together and like you saida community of practice for data has tobe across the industry and that makes itmore viable for our customers to get toinsights quicker yeah and it also goesback to the point that was being madeyesterday as wellaround the creation of marketplaces datamarketplaces and and and the ability uhtomonetize your data and even your largelanguage models yeah that's the placewhere we are headed now yeah if you lookat the uh uh you know everybody talksabout gen AI I mean that's been a Bell'sword for the past few months but whatthey don't understand is garbage andgarbage out if you don't have the rightdata you can't run analytics and it'sonly after you're you're comfortable inrunning analytics from data that you canactually start using large ligand modelsand your AIand then the progression is to gen AI soit's a journey you got a crawl walkbefore you run and Sprint so yeahawesome soum Ari what are some of the uniquesolutions that you have implemented toexecute to the strategy that theaudience can take something away fromyeah so I I think there's really twoparts to that you know one is as we'vebeen talking about is data you know thesecond part is how do you move yourapplications to be able to enable thatdata so if we start about data we reallythought big in terms of a vision as faras how we could support our customersand be able to not only enable data butas Karen was talking about fundamentallyJust Landing data doesn't really addvalue and it wasn't lost on us in closecollaboration with our informationsecurity team our platform engineeringteam CME is where the world comes tomanage its risk so if we're going to bemoving confidential and sensitive datawe had to ensure that we were doing itin a way where we could get learning andexperiment but at the same time timerespect our customers andthe trust that CME has earned over thoseyears and one of the things we did wasreally start small with public data thatwas internally accessible and in thatfashion everyone could learn and wecould have a relatively low risk Vectorthat made us comfortable in being ableto do that and more importantly it alsorepresented a customer-centric approachbecause very quickly we were able totake that data and then externalize itbefore we even started thinking aboutconfidential or sensitive data and Ithink that's one of the key learningsthat we found was working incrementallyworking in close collaboration with ourplatform teams with our informationsecurity teams making it really aproduct-centric model and ensuring thatwe were delivering value for ourcustomers in an incremental fashion butonce you have the data fundamentally youhave to figure out how to get scale andfor your applications it really becomescritical to figure out how not only youcan move those applications but movethem at scale because it if you're goingto be able to get value from all of thatdata and be able to continue to drivenew value for your customers and ourcustomers you have to figure out how toachieve that and while you're focused onthe refactors and that's where most ofyour money is coming in you knowfundamentally the question really startsto become how do you get the rest ofyour applications moved over let aloneretired well for us first and foremostand minoja talked about this a littlebit earlier it started with with Googleand we had worked with many other publicclouds previouslyand the assets and the tools that Googlebrings through that cloud offering forus just blew us away you knowfundamentally we're a data company andthe ability to work with another companythat was focused on data was prettyinherent based on the tools whether it'sbigquery spanner Cloud SQL all of thesethings you know blew everything elseaway from our perspective but it didn'tend there in terms of getting scale youalso need people you know at the end ofthe day technology is really a peoplebusiness and for us the ability topartner and collaborate with TCS reallybrought the not only the knowledge andcontextual capabilities that were neededbut more importantly brought a partnerwho we could work with and be able toaccelerate the migration and be in aposition to try to deliver the valuethat we committed to our end customersbut fundamentally it really takessoftware to be able to deliver scale andfor us we really focus on two things onewas being able to have a factory bothfor applications as well as data itselfso in close collaboration with TCS wecreated a database Factory where therewas a clear model we experimented a bitwith tools and we hit issues you know Iwould be upfront with all of you andanyone who's in the technology spaceknows nothing works the first time thesecond time or even the third time butwhat we found was that throughexperimentation through learning we wereable to get a really well oiled machineoil seems to be the theme of the dayand be able to accelerate the datamigrations through a consistent set oftools so with Google's help we engagewith a company called ice buyer thatonce again was not perfect was verybuggy but were able to make significantprogress along with various open sourcetools we got to the point where we couldmove significant databases at scale youknow additionally I mentioned earlierthat a lot of the money and the focuswill go on the refactors but you knowthe real value to being able to get yourapplications moved over really comesaround the re-platforms and we werefortunate and that we had spent a lot oftime abstracting common tools to supportthose applications and for us creating afactory not only for the data but alsothe applications as well really helpedus to be able to achieve that scale notonly in terms of being able to usenative Google tools not only being ableto use the data but fundamentallystarting to get access to that ephemeralcompute which is really the heart of thevalue proposition for the cloud and thenby its nature drives value back to yourcustomersthank you thank youso now um Kieran what are some of thekey factorsthat helped you accelerate the pace ofcloud transformation becausespeed velocity are so critical today andand and so what are some of the thingsthat worked in your favor to drive upthe speed yeah so before we get intowhat workedone of the things we faced as aregulated Enterprise is the barrier toentry into public Cloud was higherso for many of you who haven't been in aregular industry it's not enough to besecure information security is like aBaseline but you have to be able toprove that you were secureat every given point in time to yourregulator so you have to provideauditable proof so the compliance burdenof most regulated industry Enterprisesis a higher burdenso the first thing we need we have to dowas create compliance guardrails for theGoogle services that we wanted to use sothere's we created a platformengineering team that took Google'splatform services and then built thoseguardrails work with that informationsecurity Partners to understand how canwe make sure that we can demonstratethat we were secure how can we make surewe our IAM policies align with whatwe've already established on-prem so wewe can then stain in front of theAuditors when it comes and explain tothem here's how we're going to continueto provide a secure compliant resilientplatformso when we started a journey that thatcan be very uh daunting task uh so likeI already said start small we took thesame approach with the platformengineering we decided that we're gonnafocus on a small subset of uh platformServices get them ready test themand we improved our processes along theway so we wanted to make sure that wewere implementing the cloud nativeprinciples and making sure that we'reusing CI CD for all implementationsthere was no more uh a need for manualTouch of our environmentsso we took out a space approach it uh weunderstood what risk we could take as wewere learning because there's no suchthing as a zero risk uh you knowInnovation you are going to take risksso it's a matter of how do you measureand calculate that rest and bring yourstakeholders along be transparent one ofthe worst things you could do is try tosweep things under the rug when thingsare not going well okay sobut one of the advantages I saw at seeme was that our leadership was boughtinto this so it was driven it was not atechnology driven transformation thiswas a business driven transformationthat the leaders were bought into so aslong as we were being uh transparentwith those leaders they gave us theleeway to fail fast to take somecalculated rest and when they were notworking pivot along the way so thatallowed us to get to where we are wherewe were able to yeah like already saidwe failed one two three four times it'sokay we stumble what we did is wepivoted and we figured out how to dobetter next time the only thing we weremaking sure that we were holding ourteams accountable to not make the samemistakes again learn from our mistakesand then keep progressing along yeah Ithink that that's a very important pointthat you touched which is thattransformation Journeys will be complexand complicated andit is important to learn fast and andthe the biggest thing is you know notmaking the same mistake again I hope wecan do that you know that would be greatso just to give the audience a littleperspective of what kind of timelinesare we talking aboutum Harry can you share with uswhen did you start the journey at CMEand what results have you achieved inthis period yeah I mean one of thethings that we loved about the okrs theobjectives and key results is that itbecomes really binary it's veryquantifiable so we really started inEarnest January of last year starting tobuild out our platform starting to putcontrols in place and more importantlyput the foundation that we needed notonly with the platform but morefundamentally automation I think that'sa key element is that we didn't try togo out of the gate moving quickly wereally try to fundamentally look atscale because we knew that to be able tobe successful getting a couple of appsinto production was not going to cut itwe needed to really get hundreds ofapplications into gcp at scale and whenyou look at our results you know I thinkthe results are really exemplify thetypes of scale that we were able toachieve where last year the full year weessentially got five applications into aQA ready State and we converted onedatabase it was actually quite painfulso we talk about learning we learned alot you know last year this year andlet's be honest the year is not evenclose to being done yet we're already atover 120 applications and fundamentallyof 70 databases converted and thatreally talks to the scale that we wereable to achieve not only thanks to thesuperior technology that we were able toleverage through Google Cloud but morefundamentally the scale through softwareand through people like TCSwonderfulso umworld where it's a Party of Three whenyou drive transformation so we'll havethe client like the CME Group and thenyou will have a hyperscaler partnerwhich in this case was Google cloud anda Services partner which was TCSum can you speak to the evolution ofthis strategic partnership that we havebetween the three companies and whatmade this partnership clickso I'll start by saying underscoring thetopic around the learn fast or fail fastand then learn fast and not do themistake again right so as we're goingthrough this relationship and the workbetween the three companies obviouslywe were challenged with many many thingsall the time and when you look inside aspecific moment it seems like you knowwe'll never be able to make it but whenyou look at it from holistic picturethen we talk about results that re wasmentioning beforeit I'm fairly confident as we talk aboutthis room as well as otherwise everyoneknows capabilities that TCS brings tothe table right TCS has extraordinary uhtalent pool that can scaleum and uh and and and pivot depending onwhere we are from the type of work thatis being done whether we are talkingabout migration we are talking aboutInnovation we are talking aboutmodernization and so on and so forth itis critically important right when wetalk about this work that the uh we thework is performed in software Factorymanner are you touched on it and that iscritical to the success that we aretalking about these 70 databases thatwere migrated that could not have beendone if we're done in baseball fashioneach database at a time then we would bestanding with the same results like lastyear with one database for the entireyearthe the reason we were able to achieveas much as we did because uh you knowTCS took the time to develop and createuh you know Frameworks that can rapidlyuh migrate the databases the partnershiphas been successful for multiple reasonsobviously first and foremost is that thethree companies the and midi mentionedas well hyperscaler and the servicespartner and CMEum being uh you know bringingcomplementary strengths to the tablevery clearly right it's it's known thenfrom the industry point of view CME hasthe depth and the breadth of the CapitalMarket information and knowledge rightthere's no doubt it has been greatpartnering with the 2s team gentlemanright here on the table uh talking aboutthe capital market and what can be donetogetherTCS brought the business and thetechnology Services opportunities and Imust say Google cloud from thepartnership point of view ourengineering team and and and the rest ofthe folks from the uh behind the scenefrom Google Cloud came to the table aswell to be able to ensure that a eitherwe are meeting all the requirements ifnot we are quickly developing those uhthose things to be able to uh exceed ormeet the expectations that we have andwhat you saw yesterday in the keynote isjust an indication of the number ofthings that goGoogle cloud has been partnering withour customers to be able to provide nowtalking about the second is that thereyou know we we have the sharedcommitment between the three companiesto be able to innovate innovate not justtalking about from you know launchingnew products and services the key pointis even the things that are being donein in baseball fashion today can be uhyou know thought about differently andbe able to achieveum you know much more optimized way todeliver that for CME and CMS customerand then um the uh then the theyou know with this uh we have been ableto and I'll say a lot of credit to TCSto deliver Cutting Edge solutionum we are certainly working uh towardsthe uh you know trading platform beingin the cloud and being able to providedata analytics in in the in the cloud aswe continue to work through our uhmigration and last but not the least isthat you know the chemistry is veryimportant between the three partnersthat are on the table right we arepresenting here together indicating thefact that we have deep relationship forsure uh so uh thank you and lady back toyou perfect so I know we are running outof time so I do want to say three thingsfor you to remember be bold in YourVision uh it's you know transformingderivatives is no Child's Play so so beaudacious in the goal the second thingis data analytics will set the stage inthe foundation for what is to come on AIand ways of working is very critical youknow that agile Centric inspect adaptapproach is very crucial so if we couldplay the videoof how this transformation is running atCME Group and then call it a wrap thatwill be greatwe think now is the right time totransform our derivatives markets theability to access our markets is moreimportant than ever in a safe and secureand Global scalable way that's why it'stime right now to work with our clientsand with our partner in Google Cloud tomake this happen I think our clientswill benefit a great deal from thistransformation principally I think itwill allow them to take advantage ofefficiencies as we become easier to workwith as a companythere are three keyvalues we can achieve through Google thefirst one is accessibility making ourmarkets easy to access globally thesecond is performance and scale and thethird is our ability to dynamically addproducts or add contract markets so thatclients can actually access thesemarkets without having to invest a lotand actually programming to themwe're really excited about what movingto the cloud means for our customershere at CME Group certainly with thescale that Google Cloud brings theaccess that it's going to be able toprovide with our customers theoptimization that this has for their ownit infrastructure one of the challengeswe have today is that our changemanagement window is so limited GoogleCloud will give us the opportunity to domore of that during the week therebyresulting in our ability to roll out newproducts and initiatives faster I thinkour clients are really going to benefitfrom that CME Group is one of thelargest exchanges on Earth and has vastamount of data that can be leveraged andput to use Google on the other hand hasthe technology Edge what's most excitingfor me is to think about the fact thatmarkets have been Awash and data forquite some time when we think aboutGoogle's leadership in this space Ithink about optimizing across a numberof different workflows in the market oneof those being management selectingGoogle Cloud as a partner for thistransformation was really quite easy andI think we're just scratching thesurface of the kinds of things that wecan do together and we have a verylong-term partnership on which we cancontinue to build ideas and create valuefor our clientsforeign"
