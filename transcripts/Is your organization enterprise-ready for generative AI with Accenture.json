so I'm going tofollow herum but we're going to talk aboutgenerative AI today and how Google andAccenture are changing the game okayClickerfirst a little introduction on meum Jimmy Priestess based out ofWashington DC I'm our Global managingdirector I am responsible for all thebusiness with data and AI globally withGoogle so thank you very much I live inDC as I said with my wife two rescuepitbulls we're big into animal rescueum and I'm expecting uh my first childat the end of October so I somethingthat I'm excited for so thank youthank you so it's a this is probably mylast tripum of flying before I need to stay localum uh but it is such an exciting time tobe in this space right uh if I rememberwhere I grew up I I have about 1500people in my town really really smalltownum technology it was in the middle ofPennsylvania farm country technology wasnot top of Mind where I grew up weplayed Sports in Western PAum I did that and actually I like tocode in in the free time and I just hadexcitement for it my first languageswere like C plus plus and Java thatlevel of excitement I went and furtheredat Carnegie Mellonum and then naturally seeing generativeAI the excitement today right it's it'sit's justengaging right as it's mind-blowing buteverybody is sharing in that excitementwhich is which is just good to feel whenin here so just to judge the audience inthe room a little bit please everybodyhas their phones and I know that they'regoing to probably be bored in aboutseven minutes right you know it's justthe engagement level uh we're gonnaswitch to a poll on mentee I want toknow who's in the roomum so what industries you're going to beon and everything elseso you use mentee.com and when you login with that number just wait for asecond I'm going to give everybody timeto write down that number I will advancethe deck and there was only twoquestions I promise to be quickgive it another minuteto get the number inand then I will advance the slideall right readyshould workit's not so we're going to go like thisall right go ahead I just probablyopened it up on your phone what industryare you representing in this group todaysee what we gotokay we got retail software andplatforms is leading the waygot Health Care coming inFSFederal even greatgive it another minute just helps meunderstand how we tailorthank you guys for doing thisanother 10 secondsall right so software and platformsFinancial Services retail and HealthCare is in the room todaylet's go to the next onewhat word comes to mind you can havethree entries when you think ofgenerative AI any wordblank huhthere's the first word there you gonext gen Cutting Edge automationbig brother that was an interesting onedisruptive acceleration automationstaying in the middlespeed future okaygreatso I will stop it's exciting times rightit's clearly a lot more positive wordsthere than I saw a few negative wordsbut we'll talk about that with someresponsiblenessnow we can we can change the deckprobably nothow do I do thatyepokay great thank you so muchall right so generative AIback to this it's an understatement tosay generative AI is changing everythingas we just saw on the screen just withall the words that were coming in rightwhen I say everything work play consumeright everything to even think howgenervee impacts our lives right ischanging the way we will work and do allthose thingsfrom science to business to societyitselfit's all going to be transformed andreinventedbut change isn't coming it's alreadyherepotential positive impact of generativeAi and human creativity is unprecedentedby automating repetitive tasks andallowing our mind to think on thevalue-minded areas it just frees us upto do such more in productivity and morevalue-minded workthe potential of generative AI to solvesome of the most World of the world'sproblems is boundlessas Churchill I believe started this andthen my favorite Uncle Ben fromSpider-Man with great power comes greatresponsibilityit is critically important that at thevery beginning of these Technologies aswe undertake these together we do sosustainably securely and responsibly fortoday and for tomorrowso what's going to be the impact ofgenerative AI on all of your industriesbased upon Accenture research 40of all of our working hours will beimpacted by generative AIso let's unpack that a little bitall right62 is the first thing we did is we tookum if you think of language universallanguage it we read emails we do allthese things PowerPoint slides Etc rightwe look at that data that's language 62percent of our working hours is languagebased we then apply generative AI tothat across the industriesof which 60 percent could be eitherautomated or augmented right bygenerative AI so it's a new way ofworking this radical shift is going toreinvent the way we we do business andwe work right that's the that's the bigtakeaway from here being 40 and it'swide across the industry you're going tosee in a few summer more some or lessbut it's a pretty consistent averagearound 40 percent either going to beautomated or augmented but this does notmean 40 of jobs are going to go awayfar from thatwith generative AI it introduces a newdimension of human and AI collaborationin which most workers will have anassistantorganizations that take steps now todecompose jobs into tasks right andinvest in training with people to workalongside machines are really going todefine the new performance Frontier fortheir company and really have a leg upon their less imaginative competitionfor example when we look at call centeror customer service around 13 tasks cameout of types of work right as we brokethem down when we apply generative AI tothem four tasks were completely humanmaybe a little bit of augmentation butmajority human based these are highlycomplex you know transactions that youneed a human person really leading thewayfour of those 13 as well were automatedthese are simpletransactions you know what's the priceof this or can you give me a comparisonof whythe other five were the human andmachine collaboration or augmentationtype right this was productrecommendations customer intent so thattype of way to repeat human only or alittle bit of machine Automation andaugmentation as we break down thesetasks to really reinvent the work thatwe do and work in a different way thisis how we got to the 40 percentso that's what I want to challenge youhere todayis your organization ready right forgenerative AI at scale how can we use itto create new opportunities as well asfor our organization as for our peoplemany have already started on thisjourneybut we need to make sure we're doinglooking at the very fundamentals of thebusiness that the foundations of itwithout a Clear Vision which is valuedriven centered on a digital core and afoundation of a skilled team ready tosupport you in this you won't be able toachieve the potential the generative Aiand this transformative technologybringsfor as much about peopleas technologyby democratizing knowledge and enablingaccess just imagine if we all walked ingreat to our organizations and we've allbeen there we're trying to finddifferent pieces and pockets ofknowledge and who said this or where doI go for this with Google Search rightvertex AI search imagine that in acouple click Strokes now your entireorganization is is API based and you canbring all of that at your fingertipsback to have a it's more productiveWorkforce that's where we're at intransformation especially with Googleharnessed in the right way Jenny I willhelp everyone totally reinventeverything that they do now it's time toget started so the rest of thepresentation we're going to do a littlebit more Accenture research with somemind-blowing facts second thing we'regoing to do a framework for scaling genAIthird we're actually going to apply itto Accenture so we know this worksbecause we applied it to ourselves andwe're going to show that case study andthen finally we're going to show demoswe're going to show real life thingsthat are in action today that'll beright at the endso Accenture research we did a survey ofover 2300 global leaders 97 of theseleaders said Jenny I will transformtheir company and their industry75 of those companies have alreadyplanned AI into their business strategyand rework their Cloud plans to lay thefoundation for the Gen AI frameworktwo-thirds of those companies arealready reinvesting or increasing theirspending right in Tech to lay thatFoundationhowever scaling AI or now gen ai2 rightis hard let's be direct76 of those Executives reported they arehaving trouble scaling it across theirEnterprisewhat's probably one of the main reasonsfear that's a good one datadata is King right50 of those Executives have not startedtheir Enterprise data and AI Journeyrightthe second part will be Talent we'regoing to get into that in a little bitright do they have the right people inplace to to Really scale this and thirdmost people who's on every mind is itcost money right it's naturally a goodImplement 42 of Executives said in thesurvey based upon their previous AIInvestments they've exceeded theirexpectations AI Investments haveexceeded their expectationsonly one percentsaid they didn'tso clearly the AI investment is payingoff rightthere's a clear path to the success toscaling and getting these returnsit starts with a premiseevery part of every business needs to bereinventedlet that sink inevery part of every business needs to bereinventedyour current benchmarks don't reflect ifyou took a tech enabled mindset whatcould you doit's not about it's too much change it'swe're all about the change it's acompletely different mindset right we'regoing to focus on the later part of thisreinvention as a true strategy likeadopting that as a sweet sweet rightinstead of doing tort reform or littlemodules that using industry benchmarksturning a notes on its headand really Reinventing Your strategyadopting that as your strategy so we'regoing to be first looking at Value we'realways going to leave with value secondwe're going to look at our people whichis our most valuable asset in any one ofour companies and third we're going totalk about the digital core which is alot of the technology individuals inhere we're going to focus onso to achieve total Enterprisereinvention one must begin with valueyou need to look on how you apply gen AIto really extract the value out of yourorganization to then achieve what itcould become a clear and Innovativevision is where you start and that'sadopting reinvention as a strategy andthis is adopted by your c-suitethe second one is value identificationin business cases everyone probably inthis room has had a list of businesscases sitting since gen AI started tocome out of how it could be appliedlikely how you did that which was a goodstart you you talk to your businessleadersthey said you know what could be likethis is what I could do right and theymight not fully understand the power ofthe technology yetbut they did tort reform or somethingthat just goes to the next step versusactually Reinventing the process as themetric to start with and that's reallywhere we're going to talk a little bitmore today on business cases but themain part about that everything that youundertake has an Roi has a value and yousaw earlier investing in AI has somegood returnsexecutive sponsorship this is clear thisis critical rightum I'm going to tell the example ofAccenture I'll give you the earlypreview Julie sweet our CEO drove thisevery single day for a month straightevery day we were on a call right andshe made sure we had the right fundingthe right structure organization to makesure we got ahead that does not mean youneed CEOs to do all of this work it'sempowering the right individualto make sure that it's a broad enoughbusiness case it does not we're going totalk about where it lives within dataand AI or others but it really doesimpact all of your businesseslast one is funding you can't doanything without moneyum you need to naturally create some butyou're going to reallocate money to thispurpose and truly adopt prevention as astrategy we're going to talk how you getstarted in a fewthe second the foundation of what we dois our people right making Talent a CoreBusiness imperative that is like thesecond step after you adopt reinventionas a strategy uh by your c-suite is yourpeople-minded focusso because Tech alone won't fix anythingTalent strategy let's be honest is hardright skills are the critical currencyof any organizationmoving from a talent consumer to atalent Creator so training mentoringeducation investing in your people rightso a little fact on Accenture on this20 of our U.S hiresdon't have a four-year degreerightyes we have four-year degree people wehave many Masters phds all our greatjobs but we looked at a different placeto some people might not have theability to take a four-year degree butthey have the technical skills andprowessness right to sign up and thennaturally we saw great potential in themand we invested in them to make sure wecan give them to our clients right sojust a different Avenue from a talentstrategy what you're doingthe second on diversity equity andinclusionthere's an old saying what you track andmeasure actually gets done rightyou can't track what you don't measureand if you don't measure somethingagainst a commitmentprogress isn't made and when I meancommitment it's not about beingcommitted to Deiit's having a commitment putting anumber out there making it available toall of your organization and thentracking that progress for yearsthat's what we mean by having acommitmentokaybecause we know a culture that isdiverse inclusive and fair we'll paydividends in your reinvention strategythe second one and the last one onpeople encouraging a culture ofinnovation so we're going to talk aboutthisum I want to a little laterbut if you know here we go again onreinvention like you know we're going toreinvent again and read like every twoto three years right that mindset reallywhat we're going to talk about the termreinventors they adopt it from theget-go there's always change becausethat's the universal constant rightso really adopting that in data literacyso at Accenture we created a programcalled technology quotientevery one of our 738 000 people HRFinance Etc actually takes core classesin Cloud AI 5G others because we adoptedtechnology as a talent strategy thateveryone must be able to speak itbecause it will transform every one ofour businessesand then finally we're all the tech mineindividuals that are likely in here thisis the start of the of what we call thedigital core the last part of ourpyramid we're going to lead with data Aiand governance I'm going to really talkabout responsible Ai and I'm going toreturn to the boundary list oneso responsible AI the speed at whichthis technology is moving requirescompanies pay close attention to anylegal ethical and reputational risksright in a global survey of over 850Executives 69 of the organizations whenwe talked about responsible AI had apieces and parts in place in theirorganizationonly six percent actually haveindustrialized and scaled this acrosstheir organization first call to actionsix percent of 850 companies rightbias discrimination fairnessexplainability are all areas ofParamount concernif you can't call anyone in yourorganization right now especially thedata and AI professionals and they cantell you where data and AI is being usedhow it's being used why it's being usedin a in a very transparent way you havework to do right so with GoogleAccenture right and our clients anyproject that we do just to tell you thelevel of seniority that this gets atAccenture we have a three-waypartnership right when we when we dowork with clients in Googleum that actually our is overseen by ourboard and our audit committee so we canpoint every single project of whatmodels we're using what we're using itfor what are the outcomes we'reachieving and what are potentialnegative things that can be achieved andhow we manage that all in partnershipwith Google and our client so that we're100 transparent in what we dothe last one I'll lead to on ourresponsible AI design framework happy totake other questions later on thisbecause I know it's a hot talk it uhprinciples and governance is one of ouruh so there's four uh pillars of itum principles and governance you need tohave a mission you need to have thatmission elevated it needs to be ineverything that you do with data and AIgoing forward second risk and policycontrol so using local regulations thatare out there to influence your policynaturally you have to be well-minded ofsecond or third technology and enablersputting in models and tracking them inreports and where they go to monitorbias discrimination fairnesstransparency right the last one cultureand trainings as a data scientistI used to love and go in and I'm tryingto out optimize an outcome whatever I'mtrying to get as a y variable right inwhatever model I'm trying to run youdon't think through what are thepotential like in the old days likelooking at what could happen because I'mover over you know focused on gettingsomething training the right Dynamic ofI'm just gonna do a simple framework forevery good outcome that you're trying toget or whatever you're trying to get asan outcome what are three bad thingsthat couldhappen on that then what are three morebad things if you're well-rounded inthat simple framework we have much moredetail on I'm going to do a sip onethat will help the data scientists andthe developer and data Engineers reallybuild a model because data is biasedrightum and then the model is just going toeven further bias thatso um where does this live in anorganization this is that boundary listsecond box to the right that I was onthe previous slide so most organizationswhen they start are in the middle whichis the fastest way it's the right blendof umuh speed to Quality as well asoperational risks it transcends yourbusiness units right now it is a livingand breathing thing we're on reinventionas a strategy and we continuously changeso Accenture we started there right inthe middle we empowered our chief AIofficer right we brought in people fromover 300 differentum300 different leaders from ourIndustries our Service Groups Etc NGOput them all under one roof and wereally set the design of what we want todo in the industry for and how this willbe impacted now naturally doesn't meanthe left or the right or bad or goodright it really depends uponum how much rigor and investment and andthings that you have in place we areactually as Accenture now moving intothe left quadrant we have now put ourCoe back inside our data in AIorganization because we have become amature uh place at this for the last sixmonths we have the networks in place wehave the teams in place we have theorganizational rigor in place on theright doesn't mean that it's bad this isthe fastest way if you want to get outthere each individual business unit cando whatever they want the bad thingabout this is naturally quality controlas well as you might have theopportunity that people are rebuildingthings that you can't leverage so Idon't like to advise the right butsometimes like for tech-minded companiesthat are more product focused this isnaturally a strategy that they can usetoosecond part are pillars of thefoundation data and AI actually thecentral components of it we have muchlayers underneath this we have a wholedifferent talk on the modern dataplatform but if you look at this data isI'm sorry cloud is the enabler data isthe driver and AI the differentiatordata can be overwhelming mostdepartments want to see that as Siloright they control access because it'ssensitive and things like that when ifdata needs to be democratized right andmanaged it's the second most valuableasset in your company second to yourpeopledata is only valuable when you can haveit scaled across your Enterprise andpeople have access to it rightso data core is around the traditionalMaster data management data migrationthings that we've been doing for yearsright it's not going to change it'sthere you need data core datasecond one data modernization sokubernetes things that actually scaleyour organization the right architectureboth hybrid and you know hybridarchitectures on-prem even Cloud rightwhat is a future State organization looklike in a modern data platform andfinally we have data for growth all ofthis new data that you'll now if youdemocratize it right you you can use itfor new revenue streams because you'regiving people more access to their jobsthere will be naturally morecapabilities that you can do with thisso on the right hand side we have theAIML Services these are harnessing theright analytical capabilities tomaximize the value while using thingslike ml Ops and and capabilities toscaleso if we zoom in on large languagemodels a little biton that architecture especially withmodern data stackum you need to do all of these fromprompting right to boosting to buildingright so buying something naturally gouse uh all the Google models right Ihope you all use them we do I have a fewannouncements that I'll make in a secondbut this is using a pre-trained modelright with vertex the second is boostingso naturally your data is your mostvaluable asset second year people usingyour data to fine-tune naturally aGoogle model right will make themspecific for your organization and morevaluable the one on the right the littledifference is pre-training your own sowhen you bring there might not be amodel yet by Google for a very specificindustry that you need to use but theirbase model right that has 550 billion onbison right it's huge but using yourdata set that could havehundreds of millions of tokens rightcould influence that for a very specificpurpose naturally that's morecustomization and more cost and actuallyhave more compute so that's kind of alittle bit of the difference fine-tuningyou're tweaking you're really throwing asledgehammer at a model right andbecause of your a lot more data thereand then the final one build your ownso I just want to make this very clearif you don't think it's the right idearight now to build your own model don'tstart there right use something that'salready there and out of the gate itwill cost a lot right anywhere betweenfive to over 100 million dollars rightdepending upon the size of yourorganization because you go from smallto really big orgs right you need theright people naturally the compute powerright all of that comes into buildingyour own but naturally you have a lotmore customization and control over thatmodel I wouldn't advise to start therebut naturally moving from left to rightis the traditional pathum and what we dothe last one is a secure data platformrightum sustainability here is not anafterthought right so naturally thelarge language model is just going toconsume and consume more energy rightright we need to be mindful from thatfrom the very startum and so if you look up and down fromthis you know Google Accenture we we useresponsible Ai and all of these thingstogether all on the data States you'rethinking of Cortex you're thinking ofall of that that is already out of thebox on on Google and then naturally theAIML layers using vertex and all thegreat things that came out even justyesterday of what they're what they'veannounced and then finally on Googlecloud and making it all secure withbandiant and other things that that arethere at your disposalhow does this all fit togetherwe're going to introduce a new conceptof total Enterprise reinvention I'vebeen using the reinvention word a lot sothis is basically the ta-da we start atthe top with value that is what we'redoing but our bedrock and our base isour people and in the middle we have aconcept of the digital core rightcentered around a digital corewhat we did here we had a survey withtotal Enterprise reinvention of around1500 senior Executives across ourIndustries right we married this with Adisruption index that we can have us onour website you can go out and see thatif you look at the geopolitical economictechnological rate the levels ofuncertainty and what we've had the pastfive years have just shot through theroof right covid technological advancesit's just the degree of change hasactually went up threefold it's 200percent change over five years theprevious five years was five percentso how can organizations continuallychange right with all the all thatthat's the whole point of Reinventingand adopting that as a strategy becausethat's what we're doing right and reallyflipping in on what we saw come out ofthat were three groups of uh companiesreinventorsshown in a second Transformers andoptimizers reinventors took up eightpercent of this of of that optimizerstook up 86 percent and uh I'm sorryTransformers took up 86 and optimizerstook up six percent so a little bit of abell-shaped curve uh where you see itlet's talk about those reinventorsreinventors view reinvention as astrategy and they're setting the newperformance Frontier for their companywith thisTalent strategy was placed at the verybeginning it was not an afterthoughtright I don't want to build somethingand then let's go figure out how weactually I need more people of X what domy skills that I need to be Future Readywhat do I need in the first year secondyear third year right what does myorganization look likesecondly invent invested in thatboundary list uh data core right of ofan architecture what are the outcomes ofbeing a reinventor10 percent growth right these thesecompaniesum 13 better cost structure and a 17better balance sheet right so to repeatadopted reinvention right as a corestrategy invested in their peopleputting it up front from the very verybeginning and then the last one digitalcore and being boundaryless API drivenmaking sure data is democratized andaccessible led to that type ofimprovement the last one that they didthey got speed to Value six monthsfaster right in their metrics than theTransformers right cash is Kingthe last one they saw value is a 360degree view they looked atsustainability they looked at Dei all ofthat was calculated and then put as acommitment on their balance sheets ofwhere they're going to transcend overthe next few years86 percent right those Transformersthey're doing great like it's notanything not to be great to have areinventor still core you know typicalbelt curve as we all passed rightcollege and everything else withthey're using Tech in many parts oftheir business but it's notinterconnected and they did not have atalent strategy that took technology asthat Talent strategy right the last oneI kind of alluded to it earlier theyrevisit uh reinvention right thatcultural mindset is what reinventors dofrom day one it is just continuous rightand you just always are changing becausechange is that Universal concept thelast one optimizers these are peoplethat are doing not much Tech at allthey're looking at business uhorganizational changes functionalchangesum and so forthso let's talk about the Accenture storyreal quick we had to do this toourselves right or the best credentialso we started with funding and valueright we hit three billion dollarinvestment in data and AI announcing acouple months ago just to show theimportance of thisthis three billion matches an equivalentthree billion dollars in Cloud that wedid a few years ago that's home put iton the same scale Cloud investment dataand AI investment exactly matched dollarfor dollar right the main thing here iswe're transforming our clients throughgen Ai and capturing the data Statenecessary for that transformationthis 3 billion is broken down intoinvesting in our people first andforemost right which I'll cover in a fewan AI Navigator where working withGoogle uh we we identify sustainabilityimpacts like we have a use case you knowcomposite uh we start clients of how dowe go from this step to this step it'san accelerator right that that ourclients can use uh in in concert withGoogle and then finally we have industrySolutions and acceleration you can stopby our booth we have many gen AI demosthat are actually live they're notvideos so you will see them in actionworkingso that's that the next one I alreadycovered a little bit CEO driven rightthis was our commitment right of what wedid this doesn't mean you have to have aCEO but driven driving it but I wouldrecommend all CEOs drive this becausethey're Reinventing their company ifthey adopt that as a strategywe started at Jenny Eye Center ofExcellence where I kind of alluded toright 300 plus Business Leaders comingin and we started that February rightend of Januaryand now we're finally moving it backinto the day-date and eye organizationso we really pulled it out as astrategic growth put focus on it putpeople on it right and now we're movingit back in because it's matured as an asan organization and we have it all inplacerightwe invest in our people so this was acommitment that we made right like Isaid before making a commitment we aredoubling our head count in data and AIprofessionals from forty thousand toeighty thousand the next two to threeyears right because our clients wantmore right they need more people we needmore people rightnext thing you can't just uh go out andhire them right got to build them we do40 million training hours per year rightfor across our 738 000 people so look atyour people really invest in that thatis critical to the successnext one Partnerships you can't do italone right so naturally Google you canpartner with right for Education andTraining and your people and they have aton of certificationsum but you need other partners even yourlocal Community Partners we have anumber of them uh I just took a Stanfordcourseum uh a couple weeks ago Department ofuh human centered AI it was uh theypublished the helm framework we broughtin you know about 40 of our seniorleaders in gen Ai and we you know rolledup our sleeves with Stanford professorsand really got taught how to createmodels that are unbiased or what typesof Frameworks that we need to reallyscale this across the org Nya NYU we'redemocratizing data and actually makingit for data-driven evidence policymaking which goes to the uh PresidentBiden's CouncilGoogle and our data backbone so all ofAccenture the backbone of Accentureright from a data and AI perspective isGoogle right we did this strategictransformation and moved to Google Clouduh to support really our I.T strategyum for be platform-powered cloud-firstand an intelligent intelligence driventhe last one on sustainability we put agoal out there a commitment to Net Zerocarbons by 2025 so naturally with thisevery time we do a large language modelnow this is a very big metric that we wecompute in that AI navigator to makesure we are on on track to hit ourcommitment for 2025. so what does thisall meanthis is Accenture on a page732 000 peopleright across 9 000 clients40 Industries and 120 countriesGoogle has powered all of it right andthen naturally our peopleso that is a that is a big reinventionto make it do across 120 countries and40 Industriesso let's see some stuff in action I'vebeen talking the whole time and nowwe're gonna have some fun and we'regonna play a little video of what is inum uh either development right in Pilotor in production and I can officiallysay one of theum uh demos that you're going to seefirst on medical record and theyannounced it yesterday on medpom that isnow generally available we are the firstcompany and partner to have Med Palm inproductionat multiple hospitals and health planstodayso just went live yesterday we turned iton last night for these early adoptersof clients and that is the first companyto go live with medplum so thank youGooglelet's play it[Music]thank you[Music]foreign[Music]thank youlaughs[Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]thank you[Music][Applause][Music]foreign[Music]foreign[Music]foreign[Music]foreign[Music]foreign[Music][Music][Applause][Music]last question I'll put to you before weopen up for Q a do you want to be areinventor so we did ask theTransformers 50 percent of them in thatsurvey wanted to be a reinventoractually with some of the outcomesthat's there thank you so much forcoming I'm happy to stand and take anyquestions that you want but thank you somuch for comingthank you"
