discuss why is it necessary tomove your Erp system to the cloudwhat are some of the the marketconditions you know customers havedeployed Erp systems predominantly SAPsystems for about two to three decadesand a vast majority of them are still onpremise so why why is it necessary tomove these systems to the cloud secondlywe'll briefly talk about the riceoffering from sap it's you know ricewith sap it's a cloud-based offeringthat ACP launched sometime in January of2021 and there's been a pretty wideadoption of that product we'll brieflydiscuss its valueand thirdly we'll also talk about whyGoogle Cloud what is the valueproposition that Google Cloud brings forrice workloads and then Andy will talk alittle bit about the customers that haveembraced this journeyand what were some of the outcomes thatthey have seen from adopting rice withsap and Google cloud and finally but notthe least uh Morgan's going to discuss apartner's perspectiveshe's seen a lot of these customersadopt rice with sap on Google and she'sgoing to provide you know how they didit uh details about how they did it andwhat were some of the outcomes that theysawum Andy you want to introduce yourselftoo great thanks Nash hi everyone AndyWalker I'm an sap director with GoogleCloud helping support customers journeyand sap transformation I've got about 20years experience of doing that frombeing a customer to a consultant to nowhelping kind of guide customers as partof a partner ecosystem and theirmigrations to the cloud through risewe're good hello everyone MorganFletcher I'm the VP of sap strategy atnavasite so my focus is really inunderstanding the business challengesthat our customers work with on a day inand day basis how that correlates to thetechnology that exists in our space withsap and partners like Google andbringing that Innovation to realizationfor our customers nice to meet youthank youso why is it why is it important so ifyou look at the statement from Gardnermore than 95 percent of all the digitalworkloads will have to be on cloudnative platforms by 2025 that's onlyabout two years awayif you look at the statement closely whyis it important why is this why does ithave to be Cloud native platformsright so if you look at Industries andcustomers are tremendous pressure tocreate new business models and net newrevenue streams for example if you lookat the automotive industry it's allabout connected car it's all aboutshared Mobility it's all aboutelectrification if you look at retailand cpg companies it's all about hyperpersonalization you know gone are thedays when you could Market to the massesbut now it's about creating the rightorder at the right time for the rightcustomer if you look at life sciencesit's all about patient experience andpatient outcomes and if you look atthese use cases for example if you lookat Connected car you know one of the usecases how do I offer you know modernshopping experience from inside theautomobile and it will be able toconsummate the sale from inside theautomobile these use cases are veryDynamic so the the need for it to be ona cloud native platform is reallyimportant because these Trends arechanging all the time in order torespond to these Transit change you needto have an application that's sort ofdynamic as well right so on top of thatif you look at it I mean you know thisconference is there's one thing it'sclear it's we're clearly in the era ofartificial intelligence as soonermentioned it yesterday in his keynoteevery sector every industry everybusiness function will be changed by Aiand it will fundamentally change how welive and work right so this is you knowclearly in the era of artificialintelligence for example McKenzie did aanalysis very recently on the economicpotential of only generative AI rightthey looked at 63 use cases acrossdifferent Industries which will benefitfrom the adoption of gen Ai and theyattributed a value a staggering value of2.6 trillion to 4.6 trillion dollars inadditional value from just adoptinggenerative AI for those 63 use casesit's a fascinating report it waspublished in June of 2023 you canobviously Google it it's available forfree very interesting report in terms ofthe capabilities of AI so to me I thinkthe you know thethe adoption of you know these kinds ofnew business models and the thepredominance of AI playing thesebusiness models is going to be uh it'sgoing to be it's going to drive a lot ofyou know cloud-based adoption and youmight say you know cloud is you knowartificial intelligence is kind of coolfor some of the use cases like connectedcars some of these new business modelsbut how does it help like a study oldbusiness process you know in an Erpsystem you know for example think aboutyou knowum predictive maintenancewe've been trying to solve predictivemaintenance for multiple decades rightso if you look at the systems that wehave today most of the systems are whatI call rules-based or heuristics rightbasically you codify certain rules in ina program for example if a certaintemperature threshold or a pressurethreshold is exceeded send me an alertright it works but it's definitely notgood enough right but if I can take thesame problem and augment that data setwith additional multi-dimensional datamodels whether it's photographic imagesor video files and apply AI on top ofthose then you can significantly improveyour ability to predict when a machineis going to fail you know manufacturershave been chasing overall equipmentEffectiveness you know OE score which isa measure of throughput availability andquality for many centuries many decadesactually and for us you know in terms ofapplying AI to solve you know use caseslike particular maintenance you cansignificantly improve your oee scoreso that's you know for us you know it'swhen you think about you know thepressure to create new business modelsuh the pressure to create net newrevenue streams uh you cannot simplyhave the case cannot simply do all ofthose things by having your Erp systemon premise you know it's a strategicsystem it has all the business data soit's absolutely necessary to move yourErp system to the cloud and this iswhere Sap's rice offering is unique theylaunched the service in 2021 January of2021 and there's been pretty wideadoption you know across the marketplaceand we at Google here see a lot ofadoption of customers using rice withACPand it offers an easy migration path ifyou're an existing customer uh runningyou know Erp or sap RP on premise itoffers an easy path to go to the cloudif you're a net new customer obviouslyit's you know you're going to start withthe cloud-based Erp application andMorgan's going to cover a little bitmore detail about what is rice and howcustomers actually adopt this in hertalkso what does Google bring to the tableright there's really two things thatthat we focus onone is we looked at all the megaprocesses that sap has within the Erpsystems you know processes like order tocash plan to manufacture procure to payyou know all of these Mega processes welooked at it from an angle of where wecan actually augment sap data withGoogle data signals and apply AI toimprove a code processor a businessoutcome within that process for exampleif you look at demand forecastingyou know traditionally a lot of demandforecasting is based on historical datait used about two to three years worthof historical data you apply astatistical model it understands thepatterns and then out comes thestatistical forecastand then the consensus forecast isusually built based on the planner's gutand experience and it's really anegotiation between sales marketing andManufacturing it's really not based onfacts and data right but if I can takethat processtypically for you know any particularindustry there's about 10 to 15 causalfactors that impact demand if I canunderstand what those causal factors areif I can understand what those data setsare that represents those causal factorsaugment the historical data that sap hasand apply AI on top of this then we cansignificantly improve for cache accuracywe have examples where we've actuallyshown 10 to 15 Improvement in forecastaccuracy which leads to about fivepercent reduction of working capital sothese are Big levers that you can moveand we have a catalog of these use casesthat we've built in collaboration withsap and it's all done through what sapcalls a business technology platform orbtp insured which is aligned with Sap'smessaging of keeping the core clean sokeep the core clean don't customizedon't bastardize your core do all theInnovations on the edges you know usingbtp and in this case it's all donethrough btp and augmenting with Googledata and the Google AI and ml the secondarea that we actually bring value to ourcustomers is in the area of analytics soas most of you probably know that weannounced a a massive partnership withsap in May at their conference atSapphire how we can actually bring datasets from sap and Google together so ifyou look at most customers I meanobviously sap is a system of record alot of the business data actuallyresides in SAP systems and there aremultiple sap Source systems as wellright so you have not only S4 Hana butyou have Ariba success factors and so onso in this methodology all of the thesap applications the data will decideand data sphere which is theircloud-based data warehouseand but customers are demanding you knowinsights thatthere are other data sets that need tobe brought in so a lot of those otherdata sets non-sap data sources will bein Google bigquery specifically withinGoogle cortex which is a frameworkwithin a bigqueryand it can be put about scale right Alot of these data sets really could bepetabyte scale and we have a method toactually connect these two data sets anda connector that basically decides basedon the use case whether you can just youknow Federate the the data audiencecases where you need to move the datafor intense Ai and ml training so thispartnership has yielded a lot of gooduse cases that we can solve for as wellthings like inventory management youknow customers typically struggle tosolve these use cases you know obviouslyyou know a record of inventory in sapbut there are other systems that haveinventory information and typically if Iwant to know understand what theinventory for a particular product isyou have to do almost you know a datagymnastics to pull data from multiplesystems and Stitch it together to createa simple inventory report in thisparticular platform you know sap dataresides in sap we pull some of the otherdata inventory data from other systemsand then basically you know tie the datasets together to provide insights moreyou know quickly than and what'spossible today there are several usecases that that we can actually do withthis analytics platformand lastly I want to I would be a messyou know if I don't mention one of thetechnical advantages we have somethingcalled live migration and my 27 years inworking in the sap ecosystem there's nota single customer that I've met thatwill voluntarily take a downtime so it'simportant to keep your SAP systems upand running and we have this featurecalled live migration where we never askour customers to take down time based onyou know anything that we have to do tothe the virtual machines themselveswhether it's you know applying asecurity patch or OSS patch we don'tactually actually ask the customers totake down time we have this livemigration feature which automaticallymoves you know the the workload from 1vmto another VM with absolutely zerolatency so customers don't have to takeany downtime so that's kind of theadvantage that you know Google brings tosap customers and we've a lot ofexamples and I want Andy to actually gothrough a few of these examples that wehave customers that have adopted thisjourney and have seen benefitsAndyall right so before I get into thecustomer examples I just wanted to kindof provide some little context aboutwhat's differentiated in terms of ourpartnership with sapreally you know when you look at Googlein 25 short years we've gone from twotwo guys in a garage to one of the fewtrillion dollar valuated companies withover 9 billion plus user products allglobally scalable and that's powered byour Google Cloud Network which is theworld's largest private fiber Networkit's the network that's able to provideyou know reliability security uptimefeatures like live migration whichDinesh talked about in a differentiatedcapabilityfor our customers and was one of thedriving forces that had sap turn toGoogle and deciding to run all of theirS4 product development on Google Cloudso they've got 20 000 developers drivingall their future product development ontheir core Erp S4 and we have a numberof their other line of businessapplications that have either chosen touse Google either exclusively as part oftheir multi-cloud strategy to include aReba success factor btp to name a few aswell and as Dinesh alluded to we've nowstarted to expand what has been a deeplyrooted technical infrastructure-basedengineering partnership to the datacloud and the AI space with the datasphere partnership announcement and sonow customers are looking at how can Itransform and modernize my sap analyticsstack with a serverless petabyte scalecapability in bigquery and cortex andall the Innovation that that brings withme I think in fact yesterday we evenheard from Jurgen the CTO of sapannouncing some additional capabilitythese around Gene AI so we're just atthe you know the tip of the spear herein terms ofunlocking capabilities with AI and soonto begin AI to allow us to better serveour customers and meet them or meet themwhere they are in their transformationJourneyand you know at alphabetum you know really when you when youlook at our latest quarterly earningsreport we were just a little under 75billion dollars in Revenueum all that kind of achieved leading upto over the course of the last 25 yearsand about five years ago our CFO waskind of faced the decision and a realitythat hey the applications andtechnologies that got me here today arenot going to propel me to where I needto be in terms of growth in the futureand Google similarly turned to sapfor our own wall-to-wall S4transformation we have one of thelargest deployments of S4 for Treasuryand finance and one of the cleanestdeployments of S4 as well and as youknow Dinesh kind of talked aboutleveraging the whole clean Corecapability we leveraged btp as well todrive Innovation around the edgeleveraging some of our own AIcapabilities to help with drivingexpedited month-end quarter in and yearin close and leveraging things such aschat Bots to help discern betweenpersonal and general inquiries and wetake all those capabilities that we'reusing internally to run our own businessand we package them as part of ourcortex framework and make thatInnovation available to our customers aswellso with that I wanted to kind ofrecognize a few customer stories andunderstand that each customer Journeypath is unique and and wanted to talkabout some of the journey past thatcustomers have taken with us and sap todate just to provide some examplesso uh gcp Applied Technologies is aGlobal Construction Products Companythey're based in Alpharetta Georgiathey've got over 74 manufacturing andTechnology sites and they really kind offocus on the development of HighPerformance Construction product theadvancement of Construction Technologiesas well as serving the the theexceptional needs of their customersacross 100 countries globally and reallythey were faced with a data center exittied to the need to relocate theircorporate headquarters and they chose tomigrate all 100 plus applicationsincluding a transformation with rise oftheir sap landscape to Suite on Hana onGoogle Cloud they all ultimately choseGoogle for the performance securityreliability and operations managementthat comes along with that and they'vealso positioned themselves in their Techstack to be able to go to S4 whenthey're ready in the futureHeartland Dental is the largest Dentalsupport organization in the UnitedStates they've got over 20 000 teammembers 1650offices supported 2600 doctors supportedacross 38 States and really they startedwith an innovation first agenda wherethey're leveraging data sphere andcortex to be able to process a massivepayer table on Hana that is thenextracted to bigquerythey're able to essentiallyextract large amounts of data and beable to run scrubs of the internet to beable to do a price arbitration tosupport their plan and payeroptimization there are also leveragingdoc AI in order to support analysis andanomaly detections when then theirexplanation of benefits to SupportCompliance uploads as welladditionally kind of turning to SpinMaster so there are leading GlobalChildren's Entertainment Company youknow they specialize in providingexceptional experience for childrenthrough their most notable Brands andthe toy space specifically aroundum you know their their their hatchimalsand Rubik's cubes and I'm sure you'rekind of familiar with your kids if youhave kids are kind of familiar with someof the products that they have in themarketplace and really their their CIOyou know came to the conclusion veryearly on that his need to transform toS4 was not separate from his need todrive transformation within his datalandscape and seeing the the IP thatGoogle was able to bring to the table interms of the cortex framework and ourbroader partnership capabilitieshe saw the opportunity to be able todrive his rise on S4 transformation withGoogle Cloud across this businesslast but not least Adco is a globalleader in the design manufacturer anddistribution of agricultural equipmentand you know the large company 12billion dollars in revenue and theychose to use rise to be able to driveInnovation within one of their specificline of business specifically withintheir wholesale businessto drive their S4 transformation onGoogle Cloud they actually just wentlive on that right now so with each ofthese customers as you see their Journeypass a little bit different some of themkind of started with a big bang wholedata center transformation some startedwith an innovation first so Jenna someof them started with a line ofbusiness-based innovation and would behappy when we get to the Q a question tokind of answer any questions in thatregardand with that I'm going to go ahead andturn it over to Morgan who's going toprovide us a partner perspective on Riseand Google thank you Andyso before I get started I think it'sjust good to cover off a little bit onwho navasite is I feel really excited tohave the opportunity to be in front ofeveryone here and talk a little bitabout why having the right partner inplace with your evaluation journey to S4rise or any new technology is importantnavasite is a global digitaltransformation organization and we'reworking very closely with business andI.T to help our customers transform howthey operate today as many of you knowthat transformation can look verydifferent in each organization dependingon digital Readiness depending on youravailability and willingness to move tothe cloud and depending on the thebusinesses acceptance of change which isis always a fun thing to work throughand so it's really our objective tobring industry expertise solutionexpertise and a problem-solving approachto each problem that we work with ourclients the point in starting at aproblem-solving approach allows us tounderstand what the outcome of asolution should be so that we can backinto what's the best way to get that andensure that we're notchanging your path in the long runeverything that we do with our customersthe objective is to make sure we don'thinder your adoption of Technology downthe roadyou'll see here with 24 years of sapexperience or organization is wellsuited to speak about the success of S4and Rise deployments we've done ECC andwe've helped clients move from thoseLegacy erps to new our erps by helpingthem find what works for their businesswhich again is different depending onwhere each organization is at in theirJourneyon the right side I highlight just someof our capabilities and what I think isimportant on that part to understandingwho we are and how we work with ourcustomers is that we don't just start atthe beginning with every client thereare some organizations who have alreadydeployed a new solution need a partnerto help them roadmap there are companiesthat we work with who are looking atfully transforming and moving to thecloud and don't know where to getstarted and so our objective is to helpstreamline and simplify that approach ina trusted advisor wayso if we take a step back and look athow we help our customers Leverage TheInnovation of Rise you'll see and you'veheard from Andy into Nash that it's it'scontinuous right and one of my favoritethings to think about when I think aboutsap and Google partnering is that you'resetting yourself up for a partnershipthat has limited Limitless Innovation sothere's nothing holding you back fromthe new technology as it evolvesone of the first things that I thinkmost customers experience when moving torise and certainly that everyone looksfor when building a business case tomake an Erp transition is a lower costof ownership and you may be thinkingeveryone tells me there's a lower costof ownership but we get to the end whereis it reallyand so we really see that with ourclients by building out business casesaround kpis and where your businessoperations are before we get into theproject we measure that throughout theproject and then we measure to get atthe end to say this is what's workingyour people are adopting the process asthis is successful the reason that'simportant to do for us is because ithelps you build business cases tosupport future roadmaps many customerswhen they start on their Erp Journeymake one jump in find it really hard getto the end and take a pause on whatcomes next our objective in partneringwith our customers is to make sure wedon't take that pause because technologyisn't slowing down for us so why wouldwe slow down for itthe other key piece that you'll see uphere that is really drivingum The Innovation that comes with riseand how customers leverage it today isthe Innovation and ability to consume itquickly both Andy and Dinesh touched onclean Core which is something you'regoing to continue to hear about from sapand the partners that are utilizing itthe intent is really to keep thefoundation clean to utilize the bestpractices the industry standards and thefunctionality that sap has put intotheir Erp to drive successand use the surrounding Technologies tomaintain your special sauceone of the things we're working througha lot when we're going through projectsis we don't want to lose our specialsauce we can't change this processbecause it just won't work the sameand I think the reality that we oftenbring is you can change that process andwe can probably automate it more whichis going to create moredriven clients and driven BusinessLeaders to adopt technology as they moveon because they're seeing theFulfillment in their daily today versussome of the admin that we want toautomate for themand the third piece is really around thedifferentiated capabilities with risesome of them are listed up here andwe've talked a little bit about the newAI capabilities that are coming with theorgan with the Google and sappartnership one of the more excitingthings is that it's not just what's inthe core of sap it's the Partnershipsthe r d Investments and the surroundingtechnologies that really allow you toexpand how you think about an Erp we'reno longer just looking at a traditionalErp to help maintain our business we'relooking at a true partnership to scalehow we think about technology and how webring business and I.T together tocollaborate to better how businesses runso unleashing the power of Rise I lovethis slide and my purpose we leave itvague because I I like the idea ofthinking about how technology can impacteach line of business in an organizationit was said yesterday in the keynotethat AI is going to touch every singlepart of our business at some point whatare we waiting for and some of these thethe most important part to understand isthat again every client's journey torise to Innovation to adopting newtechnology is different everyone's at adifferent starting point on how theybegin that Journeyin the Middle Market a lot of times wesee something that creates opportunityfor change M A activity a divestitureexpansion into New Market and much ofwhat we've experienced over the past twoyears external forces that are notwithin our control but immediately makeus have to adopt our businesswe work very closely with our customersto make sure that they've got thesupport to do that and that as they'rebuilding their future road maps forwardthey've got the agility in their Systemsand Technology to do so as wellif we look at just a couple of theexamplesthe first one focusing on financean organization took the time to stepback this company is running on S4already and what they did is theydigitalized their payment processing andcreated a standard communication withall of their Bank Integrations andcustomers what that did is gave them aday-to-day visibility into the liquidityof their business and a betterunderstanding of cash flow and whereissues exist and where they don'tthe second would be around supply chainthis one's a great point because thiscustomer wasn't quite ready for an Erpchange but they knew that they needed toevolve their business so we're takingmultiple Solutionssingling it to one and providing aunified source of data they were able togenerate better visibility into theforecasting that they have on demandplanning and then further apply AI tothat so that they can look at patternsand react and prepare for consistentthemes that occur in that dataand then the procurement section here ifwe dive into that one this customer is astartup company they're running on asmall Erp and they wanted to dip theirtoe into what does AI mean what doesautomation mean and how can we applythat to our business in a realistic waythey applied some automation to work inprogress monitoring which is a standardthing that happens for manufacturingcompanies and typically it's very manualit's visual right we're watching whenthese are completed and we're checkingthe box and then it moves on in theprocess well through some automatedprocesses and data sets they were ableto automate that giving 350 hours backto their business usersthe reason this is such an importantstory to me is because in the MiddleMarket even though we want to adapt andwe want to change and we want to beexcited about the technology that'sthere we don't always have the resourcesand the support to do so with partnersthat can help come alongside your teamand support that Journey we see more andmore customers in the mid-market divinghead first into what AI can dothe the 350 hours took them about fivedays of work with a with a partner toput together and they're alreadyexperiencing that benefitthat's exciting because there's nothingtoo small that you can apply to yourorganization to start to experience thepower of the technology that we have atour handsso as we've all kind of alluded to youknow the journey to rise and to us forand to a full Erp transformation canimpact your business beyond belief buteveryone's journey to get there looksdifferenta lot of people come to that with theexpectation that this is what I've donesomewhere else or this is what someoneelse has done and what we try to do isremove those perceptions from engagingwith our customers to really understandwhere are you today what is yourbusiness ready for and how do we helpyou actually road map how to get thereoutthank youcould just go up to the uh themicrophone so that way everyone can hearboth with the streaming and in the roomthank youthank you for the microphone please yeahthanks for the informative session likeyou know so uh my first question wouldbe uh regarding automation that wasmentioned with vertex a andrecommendation AI which is part of riceso is there any you I mean you mentionedabout business processes being automateddo we have a use case or is it alreadyin progress and also is it exclusivelyonly for rice or other customers canalso leverage like if they're not partof price yeah I think we're buildingeverything throughum extending through btpum we have a catalog of use cases thatwe've looked at and I can share thatwith you it's basically looking at allthe mega processes and figuring out thecriteria that we used is where can weaugment sap data with Google datasignals and application of our Ai andvertex Ai and mlwould that improve the business outcomesfor the customer so we kind of Appliedthat filter to the mega processes that Imentioned and we've developed a catalogof use cases the Gen III use cases thereare a few but a lot of them are inprogress It's relatively newso we'll absolutely work with customersto figure out where it makes sense forthem to drive a pilot to productionperfect so if a customer goes with ricelike you know do they get this bydefault or uh is there rice with sap andGoogle Cloud I mean you can absolutelyyou know start utilizing those uhparticular use cases that I spoke aboutperfect thanks a lot thank yougoodthank you for the wonderful session myquestion to Morgan is how big was yourS4 database sizeum another question is you knowtraditionally our it teams manage thesap and once you move to the rise whatwas that reaction you observed I thinkso I heard the second question so I'llanswer that first and and so if we lookat the the size of it teams that aretypically managing an S4 riseenvironment especially if moving fromsomething potentially on-prem yeahum I think it it depends on thecomplexity of the organization and ifyou're working with a partner to build ashared Coe a lot of times our customersin the mid-market space have anywherefrom two to ten people working in theirI.T space we tend to fall more towardsthat three five is really The Sweet Spotin the mid Market mostly because withrise you've got a lot of theseTechnologies already at hand it's beingput in the cloud so you're not managingthe managed Services of supporting thoseenvironments what we see people do whenthey've got head count that's doing thattoday and need to apply it elsewhere isremoving them to how to better leveragethe technology that exists within risehow to work more closely with thebusiness users and help them you knowadapt the system to support those usecases that they're bringing to it andasking for changes and sometimes thatwill be a little smaller and that'susually where we come in if a companydoesn't have a team to support thoserequirements then organizations likenavasite have managed Service Groupsthat can help provideInnovation Road mapping managed Servicesfunctional and Technical to help onboardand show you kind of the way of workingwith riceand I apologize I didn't hear the firstquestion butI think he's talking to one of thespecific examplesI don't know that off the top of my headbut all of those examples I have casestudies for so if you catch me in theback I'll give you my card and I cansend it to youhi uh my question is to Dinesh I justwant to knowum within the whole rise how much areyou guys uh what's in the road map forsomething like SLT for real real-timereplication data I'm not sure if youspoke about it but I would know if it'scurrently in the process or is it on thehorizon and how you plan to bring thatall together I think there's you knowit's a pretty complex question right soit depends on the use case as well rightso in in the cases of for analytics Imean obviously the uh the bi-directionalconnector between data sphere andbigquery that's what we will use rightdepending on and again it depends onwhether we wanna the use case demandsFederation or demands data to be movedfor maybe a larger machine learningmodel so it depends on the use caseright so that's kind of the plan that'swhat customers are usingyeahcan you replicate this question or yesrepeatI was just saying that have you guysstarted seeing use cases where they'redoing near real-time replication of theapplication data and sap into a bigqueryor other places yeah absolutely yeahokay yeah it again it's driven by theuse case right so for example if you'reone of the use cases where we see thisadoption is quality management right soyou have you know sap qm and you knowyou have a continuous process wherelet's say a set of products is runningthrough an assembly line and you want tomake sure you know if there are defectsyou know in those products so you canuse Google vertex AI you know in thiscase basically a visual inspectionto to look at and inspect those partsand if there are defects it real timeconnects back through btp into qm andtriggers a creation of a defect in qm soyes I mean it depends on the use caseand you know and based on that we candecide which replication technologyneeds to be usedany other questionsawesome thank you very much for uh thankyou session thank you and we'll beavailable here if there's any questionsoff to the side thank you so much thankyou"
