    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thanks for joining us at the howcustomers use a security Command Centerto protect their Google Cloudenvironmentmy name is Connor Hammersmith I am fromAtlanta I've been focused on uh securityhere at Google Cloud for about the lastthree years or so I spent a lot of timeon the customer engineering side andthen now I spend most of my time workingwith security Command Center and ourcustomers right on ensuring they get themost value and leverage the product so Iwanted to I have Anita pneumonia herefrom the broad Institute to present withus so Anita come on welcome up andintroduce yourselfcorner all right you want to introduceyourself at all yeah sure uh so helloeveryone my name is Anita namanya I'm aprincipal information security engineerat the broad Institute of MIT in Harvardand I have been in infosec for the last10 years but I need to know theseclasses they're reflecting the lightsorryum I've been in infosec for the last 10years I have four of those spent inresearch as a PhD student focusingmainly on malicious detection and thentwo years as a security analyst in anmssp in the UK and then came here andjoined the broad Institute to have beenhere for I've been I metmonth actually so quite amazingthe broad Institute a long time GoogleCloud customer one of my personally oneof my favorite customers I work with onthe security Command Center side they'vedone a lot of cool stuff so I'm happy toshare their story with you today justkind of a run down a quick how we'regoing to run the session today uh we'llgive a quick over overview about atypical approach to Security on GoogleCloud talk about some resources that areavailable for customers then I kind ofbroke it down into looking at somepreventative controls that you shouldimplement or look into implementingwithin Google Cloud moving towards thedetective control side that's reallywhere security Command Center comes inso we'll dive deep into those what'savailable there then we'll look at lotsecurity log monitoring what does thatarchitecture look like what how does SEChelp there as wellthen Anita will kind of talk throughsome of the what is a risk managementaspect look like for managing risk inGoogle cloud and then of course I willwrap up with some challenges and LessonsLearned From Anita herself rightso Anita why don't you just kind ofstart us off with this security approachright what does uh that look like from ahigh level for customers so what wefound working for us at Broad is thefirst thing is you have to determine uhwhat security framework you want to useand normally in this space for us westarted small our bosses from the dodworld so we started with the Monitor anda lot and respond for just one categoryof SCC for example and later on wedecided okay we understand that whatcategories do you want to look at so wewent with the CIS Benchmark and fromthere we were able to determine okay weneed policies that tied to preventing uhwhat misconfigurations that would comeunder the CIS recommendations and fromthe policies after defining thosepolicies we then went in and said okaywhat controls do we want to do best onour environment our environment is veryad-hoc we give um scientists a lot ofleeway they have autonomy on theirprojects so it's very hard to controlscientists because and we don't want todo that because that's how they get todevelop new Therapies so um we went inand said some of some of the controlssome we could do detective controls andsome we could do preventive controls andsome we had to combine and once we dothat then for detective controls thenext step is to determine how you'regoing to do the monitoring and thealerting because if you have a detectivecontrol and you don't do anything withit then it's not of no use right so oncewe we determine that we saw what GoogleCloud could do for us and thank you theS security command center team they domost of the heavy lifting for us in nearreal timebut also because we know our environmentbetter than Google does there are someareas where there are gaps and thereforewe had to do our own detective controlsusing the logs right if you export thelogs to assume how do you do somedetective detective work in theirconfigurations in there and then onceyou determine that how are you going toalert in infosafe we all like one paneof glass unfortunately that that doesn'thappen most of the time we've decided onone pin of glass wall I think it's slackso we have to forward all that to slackand it's up to your team you decide foryour team what makes senseyeah no thanks it for you guys that maynot be aware she mentioned uh the CISbenchmarks that is one of the mostcommon Frameworks I do see customers onGoogle Cloud kind of driving theircontrol framework towards or at leastpart of it right because they do a goodjob of customizing controls for GoogleCloud specificallyso on that point right I wanted just tocall out some resources that uh if youhaven't and didn't know they'reavailable right be sure to check out theGoogle Cloud security best practicesthat is our One-Stop shop for kind of aleading practice architecture guidanceon security capabilities for uh settingup your environment a lot of good stuffthere including uh like the securityfoundation's white paper which Idefinitely recommend for any securityprofessional just trying to wrap theirhead around how how should you set upGoogle cloud from a security perspectiveit comes with terraform and blueprintsto deploy infrastructure in that mannerso a lot of good resources there for youalso as part of that and available onthat page we have our securityfoundations architecture really whatthis is our smart people on the securityengineering side have put together someleading practice a referencearchitectures for customers to use todeploy different types of workloads andapplications on Google Cloud sodefinitely something to check out tomake sure it's a security best practicesCenter on our public facing websiteso from uh next session we'll talk aboutAnita mentioned right uh from apreventative controls perspective we weall know we'd rather put somepreventative controls in place when atall possible so I wanted to talk aboutjust a key a couple key things how tomanage that within Google Cloudso Anita to you so Google has beenamazing in creating this all uh what weI call Old constraints organizationalconstraints and these are basicallypolicies you can just enable by in aClick by click of a button and that willpreventummisconfigurations within your Googledeployment at the whole organizationlevel so all the projects underwrittenthe folders will get to inherit thoseconstraints so an example we've done forus is not no default Network should becreated for any new project and thathelps us reduce the number of alertswe're getting on a number ofmisconfigurations because when when adefault network is enabled you open upwhat the RDP port and the SSH Port bydefault and we all know you don't wantto SSH up into the old world unlesssomeone really intends to have that openso that is one of constraint there's 110of them I think and plus and we've sofar only in about I think three or fouruh and and we're still working throughthem mainly because our environment isvery ad hocum there is also an option to getcustomized uh build your own policiesbut constraints and that's where Googlemakes things quite easy because then youcan just do configurations in the GUIright there yeah yeah can't preachenough how it is important forEnterprises to review the organizationpolicies that are provided out of thebox they really are Google's answer topreventative guard rails you put inplace across the organization theyfollow the resource hierarchy right soif you set an or a strict policy like nopublic IPS or don't download serviceaccount keys right at the org level youcan enforce astringent policy and thenoverride that policy lower a folder orproject level where you actually want toallow that type of activity so can't uhharp enough on the ensure your revieworg policies that are relevant for yourorganizationum so the other one of interest to usthat we've implemented is thehierarchical firewall rules hierarchythat's a hard one for meum so what we found with this onespecifically is because we were lettingpeopleum have control over the organized overtheir projects people were opening upSSH rolesum to the outside world because that waseasy because the skill set of broad isas we call ourselves is quite wide wehave people who are very technical incompute you can let them do whateverthey want to then you will have lessworry and their scientists who reallyjust want their Notebook on a VMsomewhere to analyze their data right sosomeone just opens up an SSH Port thewhole world just to have a notebookrunning and they they don't care aboutthe firewall rules because firewallrules networking is hard right so whatwe've decided is create uh firewallrules at the old level that are moreconstrained and every every time someonetries to open up a firewall rule whichof them you don't need that anymore wehave enabled the firewall rule that ismost secure for you and just add thesepermissions to yourself so one exampleis the IAP against the aware proxyfirewall rule which allows them to login using their using their Googleidentity and that is a bit more securethan letting someone open an SSH Port sothat's an example of an up levelfirewall rule that we went we've we'veused and that's what we found it is foryep no totally makes sense like I thinkit follows that same policy of enforcingkind of Google is good at that from Ithink in my opinion from a securityperspective on letting you set policiesat the org level and kind of enforcingthem down throughout the organization soI know so I want to talk a little bitabout VPC service controls right if youaren't familiar with VPC servicecontrols I know some people it's kind ofunique to Google Cloud right so it is uhdefinitely something from a securityperspective you want to look into theway I like to try to explain it right isthink about it as uh controls you canput on a Google's core apis right so toprotect and really mitigate against dataexfiltration risk within yourorganization obviously a key keypriority for security teams in GoogleCloud so the cool thing about this iseven if a user has the appropriate IAMpermissions if you have VPC servicecontrols enabled and they are notappropriately authorized to perform thatcertain action and the rules you cancreate get very granular right thinkabout even if you had a bucket storagebucket that was open to the public butyou can set a bpc service control policyto only allow someone to download thosefiles from the corporate Network forexample right so it's kind of anadditional control you put in placewhere even if people have theappropriate I am permissions you canreally stop them from performing thataction right so definitely a key controlto check outso on the detective control side this isreally where security Command Centercomes into play right so securityCommand Center is Google Cloud's nativerisk management and threat detectionplatform right the as I need to kind ofallude to and talk to the cool thingabout it is it is managed by Google itcomes it's built on technology thatGoogle's built to protect ourselvesright in our workloads that we've turnedaround and made this technologyavailable to our customers throughsecurity Command Center think about itin a couple different buckets rightaround getting visibility into whatassets are exist within yourorganization key metadata associatedwith that analyzing those assets formisconfigurations and vulnerabilitiesright a number one thing from a riskmanagement perspective on Google cloudis how do you identify where thosepotential risks and vulnerabilities livein your environment we also do some I'lltalk a little about later but but attackpass simulation analysis to prioritizethose vulnerabilities for you to helpyour teams from a remediationperspective right one of the number onestruggles I hear from customers how do Iprioritize what what vulnerability toremediate right and then of coursehelping from a compliance reportingperspective we talked about CISbenchmarks earlier but really allowingyou to report out on these controls froma compliance reporting perspectivethen we have a number of differentthreat detection platforms that arebuilt into Google Cloud that we'll talkabout in a little bitso uh secure uh Cloud security posturemanagement everybody's uh hopefully areprobably familiar with this termnowadays rightum but the way we manage this on Googlecloud is through security Command Centerthere are uh uh about 30 something ofthese controls that are available forfree as part of security Command Centerto every Google Cloud customer you justhave to enable SCC standard rightthere's no reason not to do this rightall your customers uh definitely shouldhave this enabled but with the paidversion or premium with security CommandCenter we open up the full library ofcontrols and really analyze thosechanges to assets in your environment inin near real time and identify potentialrisky misconfigurations right so you cansomeone can create a bucket and that'sopen to the public for example and wetrigger that alert and security CommandCenter almost immediately right soreally monitoring what your users aredoing in your environment to see if theydrift away from policies that you'vesaid really to identify driftand misconfigurations like I said thenwe we run analysis in your environmentto simulate an attacker right and thenhow they can potentially uh uh exploitthese vulnerabilities and then stackrank them from a risk perspective so youcan focus on remediating criticalvulnerabilities within your environmentand of course security Command Center isthere for you to manage and view all ofthese findings across your organizationuh report on it from a complianceperspective one of the good things aboutthis is you can uh a security CommandCenter is built right into the consoleit follows the resource hierarchy so youcan assign someone from your securityteam access to view security CommandCenter findings at the org level so theycan view events across the organizationbut you can also apply this todevelopers in their own in their ownproject right by assigning findingsviewer role to them at the project leveland they can leverage the fullcapabilities of SCC in the console rightthere but just restricted to view theirreally their assets what their what theyown so Ium definitely a key thing to point outthereif we don't provide the control thatyou're looking to implement right from asecurityposture management perspective thatplatform that we use to analyze thosechanges uh it built into the controlplane at Google cloud is security healthanalytics right so you can develop yourown custom policies uh to uh to writebasically write queries against Cloudasset inventory to identify uh policyviolations within your environment andleverage that same real-time reportingcapabilities and downstream actionswithin security Command Centerum so yeah the next section we'll talkabout kind of security monitoring andreally how do you manage logs withinyour organization right one of the keythings so I'll kick it off to you Anitayeahyeah so the thing we like about thesecurity Command Center is like he saidit's pretty easy to enableand it also gives you control on thesources you want to enable so forexample I couldn't talk about securityhealth analytics that's one of thesources and we have you have othersources of cloud armor you have eventthreat detection and for us when weturned on SCC because of the amount ofvolume of data we have in in GoogleCloud we ended up getting overwhelmedbecause the findings were in 100 000level right and so it was important forus to focus on each source so if you'relike us and you turn on it and it'squite overwhelming just focus on eachsource and you can actually toggle backand remove all the sources the othersources and just focus on one source sothat helps you focus your effort that'sthe cool thing we liked about SCC howmany of you here have enabled uhdetection control in an endpoint or in asystem and the customer turns it offamazing same story with SEC people go inand remove their because they don't knowthe service account that the SEC uses sothey will remove the service accountsometimes we've seen that and the coolthing about SCC is it actually lets youknow this error and you can go back andfix that so it actually does themonitoring for itself which is amazingand that's one of the cool things aboutSEC that we really likeum so for the other control that we dofor the other control that we do becauseall our environments are different theway the way our environment behaves sothe way your environment will behavelogging is very important of course sowhat we've done is we we have our logsbeing funneled from stackdriverto a log sync and that log sync uses Pubsub that hold the whole resources tothen send it to a data flow job withinas this within the within Google cloudand in that data flow job sends our ourlogs to either bigquery or sends it orAll To Us Planck so our filtering wasplanned because we have to pay for itcosts a lot of money right it's quitemore uh controlled there are less Logswith centers flank than the logs we sendto bigquery the ones in bigquery we dumpeverything in there right and one thingwe also kind of noticed recently isbigquery was adding up right the coststo bigquery were adding up so the bestadvice I would give is which one of ourteam members noticed was let's make themdebt partitioned and then based on theretention policies that we have due toregulations or what is expected of usfrom audits we can set the limit on howmany logs we can retain So currentlylike our retention would be like twoyears two to three years based on thelog type and that's what we've done iswe've limited we our data partitions inum I think they're called Partitionexpiry debts we've put them to expireevery every after a year and it does thewhole process behind it I don't rememberthe details but yeah so that way wedon't end up costing a lot of moneybecause logs really add up reallyquicklyum the other thing we've done is in ourSim now is uh like we talked aboutGoogle will not catch everything so ourenvironment is very collaborativeand um so we end up having people whoare not who have none Gmail accountsbeing added to projects as users aseditors and we need to catch that andGoogle might not be able to catch thatbecause that's where the constraint isbuilt around things around accounts theycan see and so we ended up building ourown dashboard to detect any non-broadaccounts being added that Google mightnot be able to see so that's an exampleof how you can build up to your owndetection controlyeah no I think a couple key things thatI'd like to point out here right is uhone of the awesome parts of securityCommand Center is the true scale inwhich we operate right uh where you asyou kind of see when you enable logsthrough log syncs within yourorganization right you uh can choose tofilter out some of these logs kind ofdispose of it you can choose to sendcertain files to a bigquery or cloudstorage right or to Pub sub that yousend Downstream to your sim directlyright the cool thing about securityCommand Center is you really don't haveto do anything with the logs forsecurity Command Center to evaluate themright so we Master we operate at massivescale across Google cloud and evaluatethose logs as they occur in real timeanalyze them when they're generated andthen trigger security events withinsecurity Command Center as you kind ofsee you could a lot of customers streamthe those secure events that securityCommand Center identifies right to Pubsub as well and then they send to theirstore or or Sim where they takeautomated response uh sneak peek shoutout to Anita session tomorrow rightwhere they talk a lot about how they'veimplemented their Pipeline with securityCommand Center events they've done a lotof cool stuff there so umbe sure to check that outso uh security Command Center isGoogle's uh Native threat detection uhplatform uh to monitor your environmentit's really broken up into threedifferent platforms where we have uhevent threat detection which think aboutthat as Google Cloud's managed uhmanaged service to identify securityevents within your Google Cloudenvironment that's kind of like what weare just articulating on that previousslide where we're analyzing logsgenerated across across your entireGoogle Cloud organization andidentifying security events the coolthing about this is you and they turn iton and it's firing and monitoring yourenvironment right you don't have to confdo many configuration and send the logsanywhere if the logs are on which a lotof them are on by default right withinuh within Google Cloud they're gonnawe're gonna monitor themum so we're we're constantly uhevaluating how uh attackers theirtactics they're using to uh reallyattack uh Google Cloud customers rightand we are uh redoing our threatmodeling changing our detection tacticsto really address what we're seeingacross the Google Cloud environment sothat's the the cool part about eventthreat detection is through the managedservice that we're constantly addingadditional detections to changing ourtactics right based on what we seeadversaries doing and generating thesesecurity events for you within yourenvironmentfrom a workload perspective right wehave two different platforms right onevirtual machine threat detection tomanage your Fleet of VMS within Googlecloud with one click of a button you canturn this on in security Command Centerand protect your entire fleet of VMSacross your entire Google Cloudorganization really cool Innovativetechnology that we built to sitalongside your Google compute engineinstances copy and basically jump incopy out runtime memory and then analyzethat up on our hypervisor layer to notimpact your production workloads toanalyze that from threatsone of the first things we've done toreally build detections around here wasidentifying when crypto miningsoccurring in your environment it is oneof the most common security events wesee in Google Cloud when someone handlesa service account key and then now allof a sudden someone spun up as many VMSas they can and are mining crypto withinyour organization in my experience whatI've seen when that happens thatattacker is not going to deploy yoursecurity agent right so it is think ofthis as another layered control that youcan put into place where we're there isno agent involved it's an agentlessruntime detection platform to analyze uhfor threats in your Fleet of virtualmachineswe do something similar on the gke sideright with container threat detectionright the cool thing about gke right acontainer threat detection is the easeof deployment right is it I constantlyhear from customers how they struggledto operationalize getting end users todeploy agents to their endpoints rightespecially in gke it's even can be evenmore difficult right and and so whenagain once again when you turn that onfrom theuh within security Command Center uh theease of deployment is automated right uhthat we have built in a ktd or containerthreat detection Linux security moduleinto the Container optimize OS versionso when you turn on container threatdetection from SCC we're going toautomatically deploy ktd Daemon set toeach of the nodes running in GK and thenthat really lights up that Linuxsecurity module that's built into causeright so then where now once thathappens then we're now sending securityTelemetry to our detection plane wherewe're analyzing for threats once againoffloading that from your workloadsright none of that's occurring on yourcompute power there so we do a lot ofcool things from a runtime detectionperspective but the one thing I want tocall out is uh this is one of thoseareas where we're leveraging Google'smachine learning expertise where weanalyze every single script that'sexecuted on those containers categorizedit and then analyze do we think this wasmalicious or not so we have been able totell with a very high probability whenwe think someone's executing a maliciousscript on your containers right the onething I've seen here talk aboutcustomers is there's always going to besome zero day vulnerability that someoneis exploiting but we found this controlto be very effective and a high fidelitysignal and we think someone'scompromised your containersso real uhthe couple things just to call out tosummarize from a threat detectionperspective in SCC it's a managedplatform where we're constantly changingand adding detections for you reallyeasy to deploy and manage across yourentire gcp organizationoopsso uh from a risk management perspectiveright so we've talked about detectivecontrols SCC is really monitoringactivity within your environmentidentifying control violations right andthe cool thing I wanted to call outright is uh show out the attack passsimulation capabilities that are part ofsecuh we recently went uh GA with thiscapability uh to be honest it is one ofthe coolest Innovations I've seen fromthe security command center team sinceI've been here uh so what we're doing iswe're uh every uhsix hours or so currently I think we'reanalyzing uh simulating an attackercoming from the internet exploitingdifferent vulnerabilities within yourenvironment to reach high value assetsright you can Define what a high valueAsset means to you right you can use sayanything in this project anything downto a specific resource type with aspecific label right you say I want toconsider this a high value Asset andwhat that does is by you defining whatmeans what is high value to you as anorganization right that allows us tocustomize these risk scores that we'reevaluating these simulations that we'rerunning automatically within yourenvironment that does two things rightone it gives you a risk score on eachfinding that we provide in SCC to show arisk score right so it really helps youfrom a customer perspective and securityteams how do we really prioritize from aremediation perspective right supercritical and a big bang for your buckfrom a customer perspective it we alsoprovide visualizations right to viewwhat does that attack path look likeright uh I'll be honest right in some ofmy larger customers this can get quitecomplex so it wouldn't be 2023 at GoogleCloud next if we didn't mention AI rightso this is actually where we'veleveraged Google's gen iterative AIcapabilities to wheresomeone can come in and click a buttonand provide we can provide an AIgenerated summary so that an analyst canreally understand what am I looking athere what is the key risk what should Ido to remediate this and doesn't requirea Google Cloud architect to be thereright so definitely some coolcapabilities there I think uh Anitamaybe talk about kind of what do youtypically see from uh how are you guysmanaging risk within so the way wemanage risk right now is first of allyou need to identify your assets as wellas where the misconfigurations might beand this is where SCC comes in reallyhandy because we don't have to do anywork we do work there but not as much aswe would have to if we had to build itourselves once you do that then you haveto manage the um manage whatever youfound and this is where we do most oflike our soil automationto build out and say okay I need to findinformation best on this on this riskthat I found on misconfiguration I foundand the the attack part comes in reallyhandy as well we're trying to see how tointegrate that and once we haveunderstood that the risk associated tothat specific SEC finding ormisconfiguration we found then we haveto remediate and how do you remediatethat with us we have to work with usersbecause we do not haveum what the editor writing in theirprojects because they don't want totouch their projects so we have to workwith users and give them informationthat makes sense to them to be able toremediate some you can just send them aslack message and they will do it rightaway and some you have to actually callthem and do a little bit of white glovetreatment to actually get thoseremediate those risks remediated sothat's how we we do it on our sideI can't harp enough on the cool stuffthat the broad Institute has done from asecurity perspective on Google Cloudright uh so shout out to Anita and therest of the broad team you guys havedone an awesome job uh I don't I'll giveyou a kind of sneak peek of why I thinkit's awesome but please go check outAnita's kind of Deep dive session in howdid they build this Automation andorchestration on security Command Centerevents and how are they leveraging thiswith it in their environment today butthey've done a lot of cool stuff tocreate an automated pipeline when SEC ismonitoring their environment triggers anevent like a bucket is open to thepublic right they've really donesomething automated enrichment queryingaudit logs to say who was it thatactually opened that bucket to thepublic right and then they have uhcreated a customized risk score rightSEC can tell you that we think sosomething is high low medium criticalthat's what we based on what we see andwhat we think but it's different if itcomes from a project where you know youhave sensitive data or is super criticalto your organization right so you wantto react differently in that instanceright so the bread's done an awesome jobat really customizing that risk score sothey can take different action if it'sin a development project versus a knownproject what we're really want toprotect right those kind of things andthey've been a really cool integrationto send a slack message to the team sothey can quickly triage and act on thatevent in real time right so just a sneakpeek a lot more uh please check out thesession tomorrow rightwe'll get to talk about wewill help build the till so topicMatthew Jeff they're all here with me soyou can ask us questions we'll talkabout a tool that we like using which iscalled times that makes coding it's acordless tool so we get to do someautomations with that and like we talkedto talk about slack alerting and how wealso make sure that we manage ourcapacity as a team because we don't wantto overwhelm ourselves using jira soyeah talk more talk tomorrowno awesome so uh I wanted to uh kind ofwrap real quick uh with just somechallenges and Lessons Learned rightwhat what is the broad Institute kind oflearned it doesn't necessarily need tobe about security Command Center butwhat what are some of those challengesand lessons you've learned from asecurity perspective in Google Cloudso I one of the things that I I sayevery day is uh the organizationalpolicies or constraints are a friend soreview those and implement the ones thatmake sense you don't have to do all ofthem at a goalum the other thing is hierarchicalfirewalls are very good but they don'tstop users from implementing horriblefirewall rules so you need to be able tocost correct right if you create acaregiver firewall that doesn't mean youwash your hands of it you still have tomonitor because users are like you knowfor saying always the weakest chain inthat link right and don't don't tellthem I said thatum it's process is always important sodetermine your process first before youbuild automation because if you build abad automation it will cost you timeinstead of actually saving you time andthen like I've already stayed SEC wantto catch everything because they don'tknow your environment like you do so tryto build out your own custom detectionsand try to understand themI I think I always tell my teamautomation is important and theiteration is also important so our teamwill have a rule if I do it for morethan five minutes more than twice a weekI need to automate it and that's how webuild out automations and then iteratingand going back and finding out whereyou've made mistakes because mistakeswill happen you'll have gaps I thinkthat helps you actually decide whichpolicies you do next you implement nextor which controls you implement next andwhere you have to have some improvementso those are some of the things we'velearned along the wayyeah I can't harp enough on drivingautomation especially especially whenyou're dealing at scale and Cloud rightthat's one of the reasons why I think uhthey've kind of stood out from a lot ofthe other customers I work with isbecause they did invest in coming upwith a strategy and then building outthe automations where they make sense Iknow like I think it all started withyou guys had an intern and you're ableto like throw at and build some coolstuff and uh congratulations you guyshave done a lot of cool stuffum and the intern that we throw thingsthat is now a senior informationsecurity companythat's awesome yeah yeah very coolcongratulations you guys have done a lotof cool stuff so I thinkwhat are some of the other things thatyou've used from a security perspectiveacross Google Cloud that uh I can thinkof a few that you guys have done sogreat yeah so right now we using I am Iam recommender which is how we get usersto uh the principle of least privilegeimplement the principality at leastprivilege because people give themselvesif I I want to have good rights in myenvironment but I don't need those goodrights right so we tell them you don'tneed editor just give yourself a storageadmin you will still do the work you'redoing right now so that's I amrecommended has been very helpful wherewe've built uh one of our team membersMatthew has helped build a dashboardthat um like an infosec dashboard thatlets them know where they could actuallyimplement the IM recommendations have aclick of a button because that givesthem access instead of going to the RSGoogle uh the Google GUI sometimes yeahbut sometimes we also give them the linkto the Google GUI itself so then to beable to see that and then the otherthing we're actually playing around withis the policy analyzer as well which isreally coolum uh one of the things we found is likeuh understanding where the security keysare being used and which security skillshave not been used for years and maybetelling them hey this security key hasnot been used for a year could youplease delete it you don't need thatanymore so that has been really alsovery helpful I think you hit on one ofmy pet peeves if I could give everybodyone a bit of advice make sure you haveappropriate controls and guard railsaround using service count Keys it isthe number one risk I see in customersday in and day out where they havemishandled a service account key thatsomeone uploads to a public git repo orsomething and then is someone is miningcrypto in your environment right so uhdefinitely look to provide governancearound that there arerecommender actually alerts in securityCommand Center will tell you when aservice account has been dormant I meanit's not being used go clean it up whenyou haven't rotated a service accountkey over certain days 90 days I think itis those kind of things the recommendersuite is awesome in Google Cloud wherewe're crunching the data in thebackground to show you over permissionedusers and service accounts uh I I can'tunderstate IAM and Cloud right given theconnected nature and that's one of thehighlights I've seen working withcustomers Lately from the attack passsimulation perspective is it reallyhighlights where customers have overpermission service accounts that mayallow an attacker to move laterallyacross your environment so it's reallywe're really working really hard to howcan we provide that visibility to ourcustomers to help make that easier foryou to solve and really focus onremediation rightjust wrap up queer few things we have aseries of cloud security workshops thatGoogle cloud is running across thecountry really globallyfeel free we'll post you can find thelink online as well we have some comingup I know going to London and UK here uhnext month so please join us at uh Cityclose to you always feel free as well toreach out to your account team where weuh can also work with you on aone-on-one basis as wellcheck out some other resources from asecurity perspective a lot of goodcontent here at next on the securitysideand please uh leave a review let us knowuh from a feedback perspective uh whatwe can improve on in the future and thenI just want to say thank you for kickingoff the next 23 with us in securitythank you Anitathank youforeign"
