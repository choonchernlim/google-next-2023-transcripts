    "transcript": "[Music]my name is Forest Brazil and it's sogreat to welcome you here to thedeveloper keynote at Google Cloud nextalong with my good friend and co-hostRichard coder hi Richard that was absurdbut that was awesome who who doesn'twant more of that did that just for youRichard Hey listen it's great to see youout here in Legacy land what are youdoing here yeah you know every time Ihave built anything successful which israre it has still found a way to becomeLegacy that's right well honestly youknow Legacy it's just a fancy word forthe thing that works right the thingthat generates Revenue that's right solet's get a show of hands who here hasbeen running something that's been inprod for five years five years 10 yeahdo I get 10 15 do I get 15 15 20 whatwhat are you doing 20 years that isamazing uh we'll give some T-shirtsthere's a lot of value over the yearsthat's awesome right but there's alsosome pain it's not allcelebration yeah we get there's somepain there too right yeah you knowGoogle itself is actually turning 25years old this year so we've beenthrough our share of growing pains aswell for example back in 2008 Google wasrunning into a persistent bug on ourload balancers which back then they werethirdparty Hardware devices now thesedevices they couldn't do layer three incap they couldn't push large configs andwhen the network experienced a type oftraffic called ARP storms the loadbalancers would enter a catastrophicfailure mode and the vendor said fixingthe problems wasn't a high enoughpriority fornow our traffic site reliabilityengineering team said fix it or we'llfigure out another solution and thevendor said good luck so the sresdecided to roll their own load balancingin software on top of commodity Linuxservers and that's how we developedmaglev which is the faster more reliabletechnology that's been balancing all ourdata center traffic since 2009 thatincludes all our Cloud Lo balancersright yeah the whole cloudload balancingfamily too but here's my favorite partof the story okay Trisha Weir who wasone of the brilliant sres who helped tolaunch maglev she had one of thoseLegacy load balancer devices bronzed andhere's a picture that she sent of itcheck out that engraving on the top inloving memory one feature too few oneARP storm too many talk aboutcelebrating your legacy that's right Ithink the real moral of the story is youdo not mess with our traffic sres soI'll go one better though let's one upyou so back around 2010 or so ritersdiscovered an unintentional feature ofGoogle translate anybody remember thisoh that UI that's a in the past yeah soif you went into this old translate UIand took this particular sense ofnonsense syllables then translated fromEnglish to German came out sounding likethis seems pretty Harless I love thatlittle that's my favorite one yeah it'spretty pretty harmless I would say so Imean there was one problem with thisservice though it wasn't provisioned tobe super large so would that beatboxingfeature you know would mess things up ifit ever went viral so of course it wentviral every time slash do or Redd itthought it'd be hilarious they they'dnail the service and the service wouldfall over and our poon call folks wouldget paged so the short-term fix wassomething we all do we over-provisionthe service now of course you could cashand do things like that but the rootproblem was that generating soundsexpensive so we had to reduce thatdisparity between the ease of a singleuser making a request and then the CPUcost of generating audio and that's oneof the drivers that led us to thearchitecture Innovations we enjoy todaylike on device ml translation and voicesynthesis that's right you know I lovethat story Richard because it reminds usthat dealing with these surprising edgecases right in Legacy workloads it's abig part of how we innovate and take thenext step past that Legacy yeah so lookso far you've heard a bunch of excitingannouncements here at next you might beasking all right how do these help meout in Legacy land where maybe I don'tget to choose a brand new tech stacktomorrow and I have a limited number ofinnovation tokens I get to spend andbusiness constraints on when and where Ican spend them so today we're going toshare some lore if you will about howGoogle Engineers have rebuilt our ownlegacy over the years and we're going toshow you how some of the latest GoogleCloud features you might have heardabout so far at next can help you dothat too but we're going to need somehelp so we invited some very specialpeople to help us out some of our GoogleCloud Champion innovators that's rightyeah the champion innovators come fromall over the world they are some of thetop experts in Google cloud and uhthey're solving real problems every daywith Google Cloud so they're going tohelp help us figure out how to get themost out of all these brand new featuresin fact we have a pretty strongcontingent of Champions in the room withus today where you at Champions there'sour Champions here we go awesome greatto have you here that's an enthusiasticBunch all right well hey let's meet someof our Champions now confirmancerecording there he is and if you couldremove your glasses with the glasses offget you a little bitcentered perfect[Music]when we're talking about LegacyLegacy allfirst it gives me this uneasyfeeling I would say it's a robust cicpipeline best possible hybrid solutionfor us it's putting generative AI towork but then the key thing to me isalways the the talent rightsecurity oh sorry cut you off tooearly crash production server on aFriday night technical level of peoplecoming into theplatforms a perfect world in a perfectworld perfect world training learningtaking ideas and sharing it out to thecommunityyou know infrastructure and you knowmodernization is is all of it togetherto me in a perfect world all thetechnicians can make the Investmentsthey need to to help our systems workright that's fantastic that's all we[Music]need thanks so muchChampions yeah that'sright well over the next few minutesfour of these amazing Championinnovators are going to help Richard andme take you on a whirlwind tour of fourbig areas where new features from GoogleCloud can help us build our next Legacyapplication development platformengineering security and datadevelopment with AI and uh if thatgraphic looks kind of like a rollercoaster to you well maybe that's aptbecause all the demos you're going tosee today are 100% live let's hope thisworks but first up to help us reimaginewhat building apps looks like in agenerative AI world we have Championinnovator and workspace GTE Alice keerAlice come on[Music]up hey Al hey thanks so much for beinghere thank you Alice you are known asthe queen of spreadsheets is that rightthat is right I always say that inanother life I would have been aspreadsheet but in this life I'm aGoogle Cloud innovator champion and I'ma big fan of using Google workspace toautomate whatever I can as quickly aspossible with spreadsheets right theanswer is always a spreadsheet automateeverything and if necessary use code ohI like that that should be on a t-shirtso Alice of the new announcements atnext which are you most excited about sofar well I think a lot of us are gettingthis question from our stakeholdersright now what is the highest leverageuse of our time and generative a has AIhas changed that calculus a little bithasn't it see you're a math teacher Isee what you did there yeah that's rightso I'm interested in Duet AI butparticularly duetin app sheet like how can I automatewith just those tools that's right sorecall that duet AI which who's heardthe term duet AI at time or two at nextso far a few of us have it's our newgenerative AI capability it's integratedinto the core of both Google workspaceand Google Cloud right and it can helpyou write code analyze security threatsand even develop applications or sowe've been told so let's do this let'stake kind of a gnarly use case and let'ssee how far we can get into it usingjust duet Ai and app sheet before wehave to parachute out into some kind ofcustom code sound good yeah deal awesomeso what should we build gosh in my dayjob I'm a teacher helping people get themost out of Google workspace and I heara lot of surprising use cases to startwith a spreadsheet yeah so how about uhincident reporting so let's say forexample that I'm a school resourceofficer right or maybe even the shiftsuperviser on a factory floor I mightwant a consistent way for anybody toreport safety incidents or maybe justnear misses yeah like maybe just takinga picture with their phones yeah okay souh let's build a prototype now I'm goingto pop into Google Chat where I have theapp sheet bot which in fact is poweredby duet AI now what do we want thefeatures of this thing to be gosh I meanI wanted to easily capture data using aphone or tablet so anyone in the schoolor on the shop floor can initiate areport the safety team should have anoperational dashboard so they can trackand escalate issues and we're going towant some help from it to establish amethod for it AI to evaluate thepictures for specific areas to see ifthey are in compliance sounds good solet me see if I can get that into aprompt that du I can use so I need tocapture incident reports each incidenthas a type status description a date andeach incident should be assigned to whata team member right so let's put this inand see what happens now I didn'texactly give duet AI an architecturediagram there so it's going to beinteresting to see how it things an applike this should be built and look atthis what it gave us is a couple oftables so we've got a team members tableand we've got an incident table and aswe can see by this team member ID itseems to think there should be somerelationship between them so that seemscool we can click on this little pencilif we want to make changes to this butactually I think we can also do thatthrough chat so any changes you think weshould make oh you know it looks prettygood so far but you know can we providesome constraints on the type of incidentbecause I really just think that shouldnot be a free text field I think you'reright so we'll say type should be majoror minor and then let see if duet canactually apply this to our appdescription and it looks like that it'sactually changed it to a list Isn't thatcool it can strain that field for us soit'll want us to look at our appstructure again just confirm that uh itstill looks like what we want and itlooks about the same so now we'll justAdvance through the next couple of uhprompts here we can add notifications ifwe want did you know that you can getlots and lots of email from M if youlike I love email I know you do welljust to be kind to your inbox we'll skipthat for right now and then all we haveto do is Click create app and uh when Iclick on this the theoretically we'regoing to get a whole web applicationcould I get some game show music pleaselet's see what happens all right holdtight let's see what happens so it'sgoing to set up our new app I feel veryexcited about this you don't believe itI don't think it's going to happen allright so it's going to customize ourfeatures our design I don't know exactlywhat's going on behind the scenes therebut here we go we've actually got an appyay what and so this is actually let mejust Orient you to what's going on herewe've built an application that can beresponsive to a mobile uh tablet ordesktop versions and you can see thatit's created a couple of views for usone is our list of incidents and thenthe other is our list of uh team membersthat might be assigned to thoseincidents and uh if you check this outwe can tweak anything we want in the appsheet IDE uh if we need to so we've gotdata here and you can see it's createdtwo tables for me um it's got listed allof our fields that we need we can changethose types but Alice I know you'regoing to love this if I click on viewdata source here okay all right and welook at what's actually looking behindthis what does that look like to you ohmy gosh it kind of looks like a Googlesheet spreadsheet it does yes butactually under the hood this is a fullrelational database it's running onspanner uh and as you can see duet waskind enough to provision some exampledata for us which is nice to see but Iactually don't need it so I'm going toclear that out fornow well for can we add an integrationback into Google Chat as well so thesafety team can be notified and takeaction when an incident is reported apreent question yes you can so there isa chat app integration right here in appsheet and I can click through that andactually provision that with just acouple of clicks that might take asecond it's provisioning a new GoogleCloud project in the background so we'llgive that a second to run now anothercool thing I want to call out is thatthere's actually an app sheet phone appso we've built a mobile app here as wellas a desktop app so do this for me goahead and tap the app sheet app on yourphone you see that there yeah it saysincident tracker oh look at this wowit's already up there for us yeah and sowe've got our incident list it's emptycuz I just deleted all that sample dataso that was what uh I'm not going to sayit was 2 minutes everything takes 2minutes okay but uh it wasn't that manyminutes we just shipped a web and mobileapp and we mostly use natural languageright to describe it so as a developerthis is really getting my wheels turningright like how much farther can I gobefore I have to start writing code yeahgood question like ideally I shouldn'teven have to type the incident reportright like I'm imagine trying to do thiswith a walkie-talkie in one hand while Ihave a stack of papers to grade so can Ijust narrate it with my voice that is agreat use for another cool thing we justshipped which is unstructured audiocapture with du AI so try this I wantyou to hit that plus button there allright and then hit the audio button andwe're going to see if we can justnarrate this new incident report so youdon't have to go a and hit the audiobutton for me you don't have to likenarrate exactly what's in each fieldwhich is good because you can't actuallysee them right now just kind of tellduet more or less what you think shouldbe in this report and we'll see if itcan connect the dots so go ahead rightso I'm thinking this is a minor securityincident that happenedyesterday oh analyzesee whathappens oh it's minor incident Min inthe date is what is today 30th yeahyesterday at 12:00 a.m. okay so we couldtweak that by hand if we needed but itworks so we'll hit accept values yeahand then hit save and then I should seethat pop right back up here in thedesktop version as well because this isall pretty well synced yep and I've gotone incident there oh and I should evencall out you don't have to have thisboring uh list view if you want we'vegot table views and gallery views andall kinds of different things that canshow up here super super cool so we'vebeen back to app sheet and we've seen uhthat we've actually able to autocclassify that response into our form sowe went from idea to app in some numberof seconds we added these rich userexperiences with audio capture and chatbut there's one more big feature Alicethat you said you wanted to add there isand that's the ability to actually takea picture of our workstation here andsee if the AI can figure out if it's inor out of compliance yeah wa can we doit with app sheet ah well uh no uh we'regoing to have to break the glass andconnect thisgood Lord connect this app to vertex AIoh well it was fun while it lasted forus it was fun but this is where realitykicks in right I mean as a developerwith existing workloads you're likelygoing to have existing apis and LLmodels and and so on that you want tomake available to other parts of thebusiness and it turns out that app sheetlets you put a new front end on thatstuff super quickly while staying in theGoogle workspace world of single sign onwith familiar forms and such exactly solet's say that I've built an amazingvertex AI Vision model to help identifypictures of workstations that are out ofcompliance actually let's not say thatlet's show it I actually have that appavailable right now it's built out in adifferent Google Cloud project um it'sbehind an apogee API and it looks alittle something like this okay cool soyou can see some amazing uh developerstyling going on in that diagram but uhwhat we're looking at here is it's a acloud run service that uh fronts vertexAI it's going to run a few little uhprompts for us and then it's going tocome back asynchronously and call backto app sheet so theoretically we shouldbe able to add that into our app sheetproject not there but if I go back to mydata we should be able to add it if Iclick plus there and we're going to hitape API and we've got this littleinspections API so if I click on thatand hit add this table it should comethrough uh and this is my favorite thingcheck this out you all it actually readslike if I go to this new inspectionstable it actually reads for me the openAPI spec and it pulls in all thesefields for the new table so it's got youknow whether it looks safe for Tex isgoing to determine that the image thatwe want to upload all that good stuffIsn't that cool it is so cool but I justwant to clarify you can trigger any APIhere in that EP sheet is able to callvia web hook now I'm an appscript fangirl and I do love that you can invokecalls to appscript in app sheet as wellas cloudsql and cloud storage and I lovethat you said appscript and app sheettwo times in three words perfectlythat's incredible uh all right so whatwe're going to do here is wire this upas a new view in our app uh Google chatwith du AI actually did this for usautomatically before but if I go back tomy views and I hit plus here look here'sduet again it's actually going to let usuh create a new view and uh before I dothat I have to resolve a schema issue solet me go back to my incidence tablelet's see what's going on here oh itrequires an image field for theincidence view so check this out allright so we've got a uh sometimes thingsdon't always work exactly the way wewanted but that's okay because I have aseparate app on the side what's a legacyrule redundancy right so check this outI've got another application up herethat I can use so in my inspections listI can actually wire up a view and itlooks like this you can see I've gotthis inspections list right here andit's got a sample uh workspace here withfire extinguishers and good things likethat so now we should be able to submitour own pictures back to vertex toevaluate them for safety so if you goback uh to your app view here we'regoing to go back to our app that's goodand perfect and working a cool corporateapp all right and then go and hit thatplus button let's see if we capture apicture and I see that we're going totake a picture so can we snap a selfieof us let's take a selfie the whole roomdoes that work oh that works awesome allright so take aphoto here we go everyone say app sheetABsheet awesome all right okay save let'shit yep let's hit save all right and nowif you pop open this card here okay it'sgoing to take a second for vertex AI toread this picture and I want us all tojust take a moment and enjoy this livedemo moment that we're in together isn'tthis wonderful the best just sit withthis for a minute don't feeluncomfortable feel comfortable here thisis a great place to be isn't it Aliceand look we got this a man and a womanare posing for a picture in front of ascreen that says broadcasting on itthat's not too bad it's not too badawesome and it says it looks safe sowe're in compliance amazing we are safeI love this because everything from thecloud function backwards can be owned byme the developer and my team but thisgives me the option to let some of ofthose business teams put together theirown dashboards and reports and so on andlets me focus on where I can provideunique value that's exactly right so injust a few minutes what did we do weshipped a web and mobile applicationprototype using natural language promptswe built an audio capture with duet aaiand we called out to other apis andmachine learning services on GoogleCloud all that is table Stakes now rightso that just means we get to think evenbigger always Alice Keeler thank you somuch for being so much for us was funthanks everybody appreciate youmy name is Anna be berenberg and I'vebeen engineer at Google since 2006 andnow I'm engineering fellow in GoogleCloud when I mov in cloud in 2015 towork on networking products I noticedthat some of our engineering teams werehaving trouble with development velocityso I ask a question how long does ittake to make a small change a shipping asingle bullet true or false for ourGlobal load balancer think about yourown products and and ask yourself thatquestion how many Engineers does it taketo Plum a bull through your stock whileyou're thinking about that let me showwhat our architecture look like this isa real microservice graph of the paththe bull had to travel from the timecustomer had to configure it to the timeit took effect on load balancer thisinvolved eight teams an API design amanagement Control Data plane teams uxUI Tech writers and more all these teamswere located in six offices reporting tothree VPS to sh r that bull I had toconvince all eight teams to make thefeature priority just thinking aboutthat makes me tired but even I succeededat that with the dependencies betweenthe team individual priorities andcompetition for resources it would takesix months to deliver the feature forone Boolean they had to speed this uphow do you build a platform whereproduct teams can develop fast the shortanswer is a combination of vertical andhorizontal ownership we had to empowereach vertical team to deliver a featurewithout this endless matrix ofdependencies and we had to buildextensible but still shared horizontalinfrastructure that everybody could usefirst we emphasize pluggability in ourhorizontal infrastructure second we'veadvocated the use of Open Source toolsand apis wherever possible forportability and third we doubled down onwhat I reuse of these extensible layersI call it one of everything effort onenetwork one workload identity oneartifact register over the next fewyears these principles inform theelements of our our modern managementcontrol and data ples and while we stillhave lots of work to do over time wemove faster and faster for example ourtraffic director team built on this newinfrastructure to cut their time ofshipping a new API from months to a fewweeks de deployed in all regions inproduction I believe that as adevelopers we need to think howplatforms and product architectureenables development and release velocitywhether it's through pluggabilityportability or reuse of shared servicesour goal is to deliver the bestfunctionality as quickly as possible onebullet a Time thankyou that sounds familiar doesn't doesn'tit that's a pretty common thing thathappensso thank you Anna she makes us think inplatforms every day which is a is aprivilege so look so far we've seen howfar duet Ai and app sheet can get youwhen you want to add new workflows toexisting systems but let's be real a lotof the things you might be working onstill involve a lot more traditionalCloud building blocks you're slingingcontainers you're tweaking releasepipelines and we want to build thoseplatforms as efficiently and reliably aspossible so to help us learn how to dothat please welcome Google CloudChampion innovator LucasCarlson[Applause][Music]hello hello hello great to have you herestoked to be here yeah I can tell you'repumped uh Lucas what is your kind ofbiggest Focus right now is you'rethinking about managing infrastructurefor cloud workloads well you know Iwould say the three main things that I'malways trying to improve first how ourapplications respond to scaling eventshow do we better handle surges intraffic sure second we want to make surethe INF structure is easy to maintainfor our platform engineering teams sothey can spend more time doing thingsthat add value rather than just keepingthe lights on and finally we always wantto make sure that we can buildexperiences that are more personalizedfor our customers nice well I happen tohave an existing workload here I wantyour thoughts on it is a dynamic pythonapp deployed to Cloud run so for anyoneto follow along not right now you'refocused on me but later uh I got thisfrom one of Google Cloud's jump startsolutions so these are guideddeployments for a bunch of of differentapplication scenarios you can check themout anytime it's an amazing way to totry the cloud so let's take a look whatI'm going to be showing you here is oneof the jumpstart Solutions this is adynamic web application I just deployedyou can see we show you the referencearchitecture there's tutorials built inand you can see it's prettystraightforward right I've got somecontainers in Cloud run I'm usingpostgress I'm even using Cloud build forCI and CD here and I see you gotFirebase for your CDN so sweet nothinggets past you yeah that's that's rightso look this is a great app for retailstore but let's say it was a V1 we'velearned some stuff right that's beenrunning in production a while we've seensome issues we want to improve so firstwe want to revisit some of theassumptions on scale functionality andeven deployment strategy so we'velearned we've got some spiky usage inneed to scale so what's my plan therewell you know there's been a lot of newfeatures released recently in Cloud runespecially and so maybe some of thosemight be useful here I like yourthinking let's start off with how wemight handle surges in traffic here inCloud Run Okay so the first thing youwant to do is check your minimum andmaximum instances all right let's seewhat we got so let's see yeah look I'mbeing cheap so it looks like you gotyour minimum instances set to zero solet's bump that one up to one it's fairgreat with your minimum inist set to oneyou'll always have at least onecontainer running ready to serve trafficnow we should probably keep an eye onutilization so let's check on those Maxinstances they might need to be raisedas well all right I'm not made of moneyso we just got to okay that limit thereso setting that minimum instances bitsolves that 0o to one problem but asthose instances scale up I still have acold start right indeed so there'sactually another really cool featurethat came out a preview recently thatyou might want to experiment with it'scalled CPUboost all right CPU boost allocates moreCPU at startup time specifically toreduce your cold starts so this canactually cut startup time in half forsome workloads but it's actuallylanguage and package dependent so youmight want to test it out for yourselfall right yeah it's just a single checkbox I feel so productive so look theinitial experiment proved that peoplelike the app we fix some of the scalingbut now we want to push it to moreplaces from just one region to maybemultiple this is where Cloud deploy cancome in it's one of my favorite Servicesmine too actually so Cloud deploy isfully managed so it works with gke andCloud run and it's actually also seen aton of upgrades since being uh shippedlast year right for our app we want tomake sure that we can move the app fromDev to test to prod okay perfect soCloud deploy also recently added theability to deploy to multiple Targets inthe single stage so for example imaginedeploying to three different regions atthe same time that's super useful that'ssuper dice yeah I love that so I cantrigger this Pipeline with a single CLIcommand I can even do it in the UI nowthey just added that in real life you'dprobably run this as the final step inyour CI process exactly all right solet's jump to the console and see thisin real life just deployed thisbackstage here we go okay so what Ireally like about this improved ux inthe cloud console here is you can seeall the things you need to see forexample you have your running pipelinehere you have all the dorom metrics andthen you can see all the informationabout each release yep and evenpromotion between environments is easyCanary deployments it's awesome so ifyou try one service after next try Clouddeploy so look we fixed the scalingneeds of our app but what about somefunctional improvements we got the easystuff but now let's actually kind of fixsome of the app we notice that it's aretail app right so we have someabandoned carts a little more than usualand we want to poke those customers goodidea I don't know let's see if duet Aiand Cloud workstations can uh help uswrite some code excellent you can't sayno to me all right so if we look at theapplication there we go okay so I'm abig fan of duet AI doing autoccompletion of code but also it cangenerate entire blocks of code here forexample you have a comment just fromthat we can generate all all the code weneed to talk to postgress database toLoop through the rows and then to emaileach customer that has an abandoned cardthat's right I like your confidencethough let's see there we go yeah sogenerate a ton of code for me in gr lookmy parents raised me right so I'm alsogoing to add some test coverage to thisand so right from the IDE I can pick theoperation or even do it right from chatbut I can pick the operation and saygenerate unit tests it'll jump over tothe do i chat right where we can askquestions but it'll also throw me someunit test which I can copy back into mycode run them and make good choices hereI love this feature so much I'm actuallytalking about this a little later sofeel free to come by to that nice um soin reality you wouldn't want thisbackground task that's going to beemailing people about Abandoned cards tobe like built into your web app youprobably want to run it as like ascheduled job or a Cron job inkubernetes or something like that nowfor me actually the way I prefer to dothis these days is using Cloud run jobswhich is a new run to completioncapability for background work it hasall the infrastructure complexity justlike everything else in Cloud runserverless love it serverless so let'sdeploy this new email reminder serviceto a cloud run via the job we can jumpback into theconsole and you can see look it's reallyeasy to build new jobs if you like Cloudrun it's the same sort of simple processpick a container pick how often it runsand you're good to go I can use the UIthe clii even terraform to deploy thisterraform so once I have the job runningwe can see that this email sender is setup to run on a schedule on a regularbasis and when it's not running cost menothing serverless serverless awesome solet's take a step back think about whatwe just did here in just a few minuteswe made our application more performantwith CPUboost and instance configuration we useparallel deploys to actually serve thisin more regions to different users andthen we're running running fully managedCloud run jobs without writing a wholeton of code that we have have tomaintain perfect yeah I would recommendthat if you're using Cloud run you mightwant to take a few minutes and check outsome of the recent feature announcementsand see what capabilities are availableto you that team moves pretty quickly soyou may be surprised at what you findthat's right well let's he for Lucasthat was awesome thanks bud thank you so[Applause]much and now it's time for anotherLegacy[Music]lawDecember 9th 2021 was a dark and stormynight okay it wasn't stormy we're inCalifornia we don't do that wholeweather thing I was living in a housewith two other senior Engineers who workon Google's technical IncidentManagement team and we knew somethinglike messy was going down wheneveryone's pager woke us up at 3: in themorning turns out there was a zerod dayvulnerability in a little open-sourceJava Library called log forJ my name is Adrien waler I've been atechnical program manager in Sr atGoogle for more more than 10 years and Iwork in Incident Management all right CUmusic that makes me sound cool log for Jis a popular logging framework for Javaapplications and this zero day announceda well publicized way that unauthorizedusers could execute code on yourcomputer asyou that's scary for one computermultiply that into the billions torepresent all the Production Servicesall the internal applications all thebuildtooling any customer compromise romiseisunacceptable and this zero dayannouncement kind of kicked off a raceagainst the clock to patch everythingbefore any malicious actor can tryanything our security lead immediatelysaid security folks we need a patch andwe want full forensics on any potentialexploits technical incident ResponseTeam tell affected folks what'shappening and roll out the patcheasyright well this is where Google's Legacyis kind of a double-edged sword Googlesearch was released in 1998 and eversince our product lineup has beenexpanding through Innovation andAcquisitions like Android YouTube lookeras folks from mandiant you heard fromyesterday this means that our systems donot have consistent back ends so how doyou determine who's calling the log forjLibrary who who's even responsible formanaging that we weren't just lookingfor a needle in a Hast stack we werelooking for a th000 needles in a millionhay stacks we don't know where the haystacks are located and some of themmight not evenbeave so how can we make thishappen super fast at Googlescale clear communication andcoordination were key so my team wentback to the basics breaking the problemsdown into smaller manageable chunks withold school classics like spreadsheetsdocumentation andflowcharts I love flowcharts so muchhere is the original chart that I drewto help our teams follow the rightprocess for patching logforj doesn't have ion steps it justcommunicates as directly and simply aspossible what every team needs to do nowwe never found any instance of asuccessful exploit of log forj atGoogle but aweek of round the-clock security updatesleft us feeling rough IncidentManagement is it's a human expensiveactivity and it really takes a toll onthe people ininvolved that week my household wentthrough like 2 lbs of coffee beans andzeroshowers not cute but if you were onGoogle Cloud that week you had one lastthing to worry about we were awell-organized force of caffeinatedbrain power so you didn't have to be nowmoving beyond our Back to Basicsapproach we've since established aspecialized Cloud technical IncidentManagement function to provide clearcommunication and coordinated responsesto Future incidents delivering that kindof cloud customer experience that ourpartners deserve may your ped staysilent thank you verymuchwow thank you Adrien well who hereremembers where they were the night thatthe log for vulnerability dropped yeahit was a sleepless night for a lot of usbut thankfully less than it could havebeen Thanks to Adrienne and her teamokay well hey it's great to be back withyou let me without further Ado introduceyou to our next Champion innovator MarkJohnson Mark come on up[Music][Applause]here Mark it's so great to have you herethank you for being here amazing I'vegot to ask you a question though youhave 14 Google Cloud certifications whywould someone do that to themselves wellfor us it's great to be here and let'ssay about those CTS I love learning butI love paying ah yeah well apparentlygiven that you also work on cloudmigrations in your day job is that rightabsolutely all the time and you knowworking with big Enterprises it's a lotof fun but change is always constantalways a constant and listen we'veexplored how some of the latest GoogleCloud features so far can help us buildapps in new ways right and how they canhelp us run them uh faster and easierbut in the real world in the Legacyworld we have even more things to thinkabout don't we so you know we got totalk about security got to talk aboutsecurity so take for example that littleCloud runback app that Richard and Lucaswere looking at a moment ago what do weneed to do to make an app like this andits deployment process safe forproduction so the first thing I wouldask is those Cloud run services that youwere deploying how are we going to vetwhat's packaged into those containerimages and what's our software supplychain security story ah yes the dreadeds3c so I like to think about s3c inthree pieces number one how are wesecuring our developer environmentnumber number two how are we ensuringthe Integrity of the build processitself and then finally how do weprotect that app once it's running inproduction so let's begin where all goodthings begin in Cloud workstations I'vegot a little python app here uh it'spretty small so that it will build fastbut it's still going to take a minute tobuild so I'm going to push it and whileit's building we'll dig into the s3cenhanced pipeline that you can see I'vebuilt here in my cloud build diagel andthen yet people like Cloud workstationsfor the convenience factor but Idefinitely think it's underratedsecurity tool you don't need to stop athopefully people are doing the rightthing we can actually create a policythat enforces leas privilege accessthat's exactly right so let me just kickoff the build of this app here and it'srunning and uh while that's runninglet's take a look at a previous runactually that succeeded so I've gotCloud buildup here and you can see I'vegot a couple successful runs and when wetake a look at this notice we've got abunch of steps let me pull this out soyou can see it a little bit better thatare leading us down to something calledbinary authorization and binaryauthorization is basically a policy wecan set at the org level that says yesthis container image has past oursecurity checks and you're allowed todeploy it that's exactly right so if Ijump over to Binary authorization herein the console you'll see that not onlydo I have the policy itself but next toit I have something called ATT testersyou say what are ATT testers let mescroll out so you can see those a littlebetter ATT testers I like to think ofthose kind of like cryptographic Pokemonall right and I'm going to collect thosealong the way in order to earn thatbinary off check mark at the end of mybuild process so the first one you seehere is called assur OSS now assured OSSis a repository of packages that Googlepreets to help make sure that my pythonpackages aren't malicious how do I makesure that I'm using Aur OSS well I getto decide in this case in my cloud. yamlI'm calling a script called assured OSSbin offz Dosh uh and that's actuallygoing to check these PES packages it'sjust doing a compare and uh if it findssome that aren't in assured osss it'sgoing to fail my build otherwise it'llupdate the a tester and we'll move onand this is why it's so important tohave a hosted Bill process all thosechecks running on the cloud buildt sideso if you have people pushing code thesetesters are not going to get signedthat's exactly right yeah so I also seeyou having s testation uh to validateour container structure as well y youcan see that right here and then I'vegot a third one that's actually uhmaking sure that if I've got anyvulnerabilities in my containers that Iflag the build and I'm using somethingcalled crus to do that that's an opensource security policy enforcer thatuses the Google Cloud container analysisAPI it's super cooland for those of you out there trying tobe systematic about how you put togethera software supply chain security flowlike this I do recommend you check outthe salsa levels at salsa. deev they canhelp you identify how mature yoursecurity checks are and what you may bemissing that's right so if I go to Cloudrun where again I have the most recentrevision of this app running and I moveover to the security tab uh we can seeIn This Cloud Run Security insights viewwhat all this looks like when the adeststations pass and the binaryauthorization succeeds I know it's a lotof metadata on each step but you do haveyour salsa build level for you here uhyou've got any fixes that you need tolook at and you've also got yourProvidence so I'll zoom in so you cansee that a little better uh you not outin how about that you can see you knowwhere this build came from where theimages were what time you last messedwith it all those things that can behard to find unless they're pulled intoone place which here they convenientlyare and it's also important to call outhere that all these insights are alsoavailable in the new gke Enterprise nowvia the fleet view that's right so ifyou haven't seen yet cuz I know it's newthis is what the fleet view looks likefor gke Enterprise I've got a couple ofgke clusters running in this environmentand you can see I've got this kind oftop level view that shows me any uhmisconfigurations or vulnerabilities inmy environment I like that it has Thisconcerns tab I want a concerns tab formy life that would be super cool haveall of those things stack ranked for mebut at least we have it in gke actuallylet me show you one other thing that'sreally cool we have this Advancedvulnerabilities section down here andthese are not just container levelvulnerabilities it's actually going downto the language package level so you seethese go vulnerabilities that it foundit's finding those and you're runningcontainers and I love how this isn'tjust some point in time assessment thathappens when you publish something toyour container registry which you canand should do by the way and artifactregistry can do it for you but you canactually use this to assess risk forcontainers that are currently running inproduction and the best thing is there'sno cost to run either of this so I tellall my clients who are using jke justturn on security posture in that Fleetview literally no downsides at all andit can come up big for you somedaythat's right so so let's get back tothat build uh I kind of feel like weshould break something make it real I Iagree with you I don't believesomething's working till I've seen itfail so this is where I I come clean Iconfess to you that before I push thatcode just now um I secretly took one ofthe cves out of the allow list in ourcontainer analysis step and so withoutthat we should see that our build hasfailed successfully and it has so that'sgood to know uh for as you double crossas you're playing games you know anInsider attack you got to watch out forthose too so we should also call thisout in certain situations if you chooseto buy pass binary authorizationenforcement and deploy or serve acontainer that violates the policy youcan click The Brak glass button alongwith a justification that's right so youcan see here all this scary Red textsaying that the binary authorizationfailed and I can click that break classbutton this will be captured in thecloud audit logs but of course thepermission to bypass that should beprovided very selectively if at alldon't make me get on or go on a tangentabout Le privilege access for us we gotto lock this down got to lock it down sowe've looked at how we safely get ourcode to production right now we've gotto look at how we keep it safe once it'sget there once once it gets there solet's go to another of my favoriteplaces in Google Cloud which is thesecurity Command Center and I want tojump into the vulnerabilities View andlet's just see if we have anything thatjumps out at us about our currentenvironment setup so you'll see there'sgoing to be a bunch of things that popup here some of them I'm more or lessconcerned about but it's this adminservice account that really jumps out tome so I'm going to drill into that forjust a second and you'll notice a coupleof things here uh number one if I jumpinto this what do we see something'sloading here forushopefully hey Google make it go fasterthere you go there you go awesome whatAI generated summary is actuallygenerated by duet AI that's right yeahyou may remember this from the mainkeynote yesterday but it's going to giveus some verbiage about how we why it'snot good that we haven't added serviceaccount with all these extra privilegesbut watch this we can actually go deeperthan just a summary if I click on theattack score itself these attackexposure scores you'll see next to thesevulnerabilities now and that's justbased on WE rank these vulnerabilitiesas high medium or low concern we have anumeric score assigned to those you canactually configure that if you want uhbut you know high score is bad low scoreis good it's like golf uh and if I clickon this number 21 here and select theorganization uh you should see somethingsuper cool which is our attack pathsimul a so let me zoom in on that so youcan see it a little bit better what doyou think aboutthat very nice there's a lot of boxeshonestly he making me a little dizzyyeah yeah yeah so the good news is anactually good old summary there too whoaanother AI doet summary AI summary weare killing this man anyway look at whatjet is doing here right it picked up anumber of things for us uh we've got asecure service account key that'savailable from the public internet Ilike these little red uh exclamationpoints here because it actually pointsto if we have other um related vulabilities there's kind of this fractallyintegrated set of problems in ouraccount we can kind of explore that inany dire it's like Choose Your OwnAdventure it's all mapped out for ushere in this nice little attack pathsimulation and it brings us all the waydown to our demo bucket which is wherewe have our build log stored so all thatbuild metadata we were creating beforeis actually potentially exposed rightnow and this is a good note that we needto fix it so uh yes that's uh that'swhere we're at and so let's think aboutfor a second what we did here uh youknow I've got my service accounts we'vepopped open these uh boxes to get duetAI summaries of the problem and ideallywe've pointed us toward steps that couldmaybe keep our environment safe I I'llbe honest I feel like my mind justmelted a little bit here one of mylongstanding forward wishing lookinglooking uh just goals for cloud overalljust say hey AI just tell me which ofthese containers have vulnerabilitieswhich policies are over permission andjust give me the steps to remediate themdon't make me guess don't make me puttogether a bunch of tools and it reallyfeels like we're starting to get there Ithink we Mark Johnson thank you somuch Security on Google appreciate[Applause]you you've gotlore here at Google we like to say thatthe best backin migrations are the onesnobody notices and since 2021 we've beenconducting a massive migration rightunder under your nose my name is sudevbahra and I'm an engineering manager onthe Google workspace team and thisspring my team wrapped up one of thebiggest data migrations in the historyof theplanet we moved every email and Gmailthat's billions of users trillions ofmessages and exabytes of data from ourLegacy Storage system to a more modernsystem on spanner and I bet you nevernoticed the thingexcept for maybe faster and better inboxsearch but behind the scenes thismigration was a very big deal you seeGmail doesn't close at 5:00 p.m. or on aSaturday night the whole migrationprocess had to be zero downtime and zeroCorruptions every bite of every emailhad to be preserved perfectly all whilebillions of new messages are flyingthrough the system every single day sohow do how do we do this we started offby building an API layer that abstractedaway the reads and writs from ourprevious database and spanner so wedidn't need to maintain two code basesand as part of this process spannerbecame sort of like our system of recordso all new transactions were firstwritten to spanner replicated and thenapplied back to the Legacy Storagesystem so this helped us bootstrap themigration and because spanner was nowour source of Truth the old systembecame sort of like a followerreplica I'm not even kidding when I saya third of the timeline was spentworking with spanner to run Gmail andspanner more efficiently leading toGlobal improvements like spanner moreefficient resiformat so in parallel uh with workingwith spanner we spent a few yearsbuilding and scaling a migrationpipeline that would rewrite all of ouremails since 2004 all all while we'restill using Gmail so one of the keytechnical decisions was allowing themigration to be a two-way ticket soaccounts could unmigrate if needed westarted off slow you know with our ownaccounts dog fooding as we call that andthen scaled up we'd migrate a batch ofaccounts find performancebottlenecks tune the pipeline unmigrateand then rinse and repeat so rememberthis is all happening in production inreal time it'sentirely possible that some of yourGmail accounts were zipping back andforth through our migration pipelinehundreds of times during this period younever noticed did you we worked reallyhard on that so by 2021 we had scaledthis migration pipeline to hundreds ofmillions of accounts and we were readyto start the mass migration and this iswhere we ran into thespanic spanic is a cute name we gave ouredgecases basically these Barnacles hangingonto the side of our spanner migrationso here's what it gets really weirdremember email is like an open protocolright so you can just fire up tnet andsend pretty much any characters you wantover SMTP so some of the emails thathave ended up in Gmail over the yearsare unique I'm talking you know subjectlines that are invalidutf8 extremely large attachment names wehad this message body completelyinnocuous and perfectly normal but thenthere was this header with thousands ofcharacters of someone's G commit in itdon't worry you can just put that in thebody we're charging you thesame so some of you have even scheduledemails to send like hundreds of years inthe future I don't know who you think isgoing to be reading these emails butthanks for almost breaking our migrationsystem you're veryclever so we knew we couldn't wait untilthe end you know to handle these spanicand edge cases so up front we builttools to fix them and in parallel withthe migration we went out and fixed allof these issues that finally thank Godhas enabled us to close the chapter onthe migration in May of 2023 and I'mproud to announce that Gmail is runningfully on spanner thanks to all the hardwork of theengineers thank you that wholerelational databases don't scale doesn'treally apply to spanner it's proven itshorizontal scalability you're all livingon it oh and we love that blazing fastsequel we're thrilled to be in a fullymanaged service we get to focus on thebusiness and features of Gmail andspanner continues to improve and deliverperformance gains allautomatically thank you to spanner andthank you all forlisteningthat was great I'm going to be usingspanic in casual conversation now it'sgoing to be super awkward uh who wantsthat shirt in the in the Google Storeshould we add that the spanic shirtthat's great thank you for that so lookwe've come a long way in this story aswe've talked about Legacy land andwhat's next in Cloud we looked at how AIcan reshape how we think about buildingsome of the apps we explored brand newfeatures for making our platforms moremaintainable and secure and now we'reready to see how the world of data ischanging I'm excited about this one tohelp us with that I'd like uh to inviteone of my friends on stage a legendaryGoogle Cloud Champion innovator miles[Applause]Warden good to see you man thanks forcoming thank you yeah uh I mean I waspretty excited about this I brought anelectric sus phone did you forget yoursor I didn't even know what the ssopphone was like 4 days ago uh I think thenext Devo is just you shredding on brassinstruments for like 60 minutes I willrock at least as hard as spanner rocksfor Gmail I mean s's got it yeah I'llbring my kazoo it'll be good so Milesyou help some of Google Cloud's biggestcustomers find new ways to Cloud on adaily basis I have to believe you'rehearing a lot about AI right now I meanonce or twice right occasionally uh it'slook it's not a buzz workor folks thisis an existential question for all of usas developers and businesses I I'mthinking about a project that we've donetogether with a customer ours they havenot tens not hundreds but thousands ofinternal distinct data sets of totallyunmaintained lineage wow it doesn'tmatter you could have hundreds ofanalysts nobody can clean that up byhand and we know that there's valuableinsights in there right that's that's atreasure Trove but we just don't I meanhow do you get at that so we we figuredthere are three big opportunities thatare present first we have to simplifydata operations and that's got toinclude securitywe've got to put all that data to workbe able to use it using the power of AIand uh we want our cake and to eat ittoo we want our choice of the best opensource tools and manage services so wedon't have to do so much work you askfor a lot but I will see if we can turnyour dreams into a reality right herelive on the demo stage so if you recallvery back in our very first demo withAlice we captured some unstructuredaudio right we want to get some insighton it we kind of handwaved away how wewould do that because that's how Forestworks but now miles it is time for us toget in let's dive in so I did spin up wejump to the screen a typical datainfrastructure using the analyticsLakehouse jump start solution rememberthese Solutions are available in theconsole today they're a great way to geta head start on Google cloud and figureout what's possible so these allow me tospin up in minutes what could have takena lot longer to do before I love thesePages yeah awesome which we'll show nowjust for the excitement that'sright so you can gu but just as beforesee the architecture we're using bigquery we're seeing using big leg dataproc all the things so to start off withfirst we actually populate a bunch ofthose more audio files in a cloudstorage bucket right a lot of incidentsknow what's going on here there a lot ofincidents we created so we're going tostart with these again these are justaudio files right we want to dosomething more interesting with them soto work with them I've gone ahead andcreated a new object table in BigLake so what this lets me do is it letsme manipulate unstructured data in sqlsjust as if I was working with data in atraditional schema so here I createdthat object table you can see when I runthe query I'll get some stuff back andwhat's cool is it's not just listing itin there it's actually refreshing thisit's constantly pulling in those mediafiles and now I have a reference to themin this table just take seconds I'm sucha huge fan of how this big lank model itsimplifies the security operations ofworking with data like this what whatRichard's showing is called accessdelegation so right now you only needpermission to query the Big L table inorder to work with data that means youdon't need direct access to the cloudstorage you can actually swap that outwith an underlying different storagelayer you could it could be anything itcould be S3 you could be on Azure blobstorage and all the permissions you needare just the access to data Big L I hopeeverybody caught that that's a big dealwhen I can be swapping out thatunderlying storage layer bring your ownblob as I I never say why am I sayingthat here but that's something you wouldsay so the first thing we want to dobefore we can actually transform thisdate is get this into a format let'strans describe it so we can actuallyaccess it more easily so I've got a bigquery function here that goes ahead youcan see next speech to text functionthis is actually transcribing the datafrom the audio file and putting it inbig query it uses the unified speech mlmodel to give us some high qualitymultilingual output so we can go aheadwe have that query down here just incase you don't believe me live live liveplease work right we don't have trustyet all right there we go so it's thereso let's go ahead and invoke that so Iwant to run this function so it's goingto go through everything in that objecttable listen to the audio and thentranscribe it forus I probably need some waiting musicgo thank you how you doing I meanseconds feel like minutes that'srelativity right there we go we didn'thave time for a dad joke there that wasgood so if we go ahead and and selectfrom here what we shouldhave is a bun of audio transcription sousing this model look we're we got allof the audio from those files now rightthere amazing so you don't need anycomplex code no ml there was no mlhacking done on stage today you don'teven need to leave the data warehouse uhdo you have duet AI enabled in this biggr project I'm here for you yeah Iabsolutely do okay so let's see if youcan get it to find like a specific typeof safety incident like maybe all thereports that say injury or somethingright cuz I'm terrible at writing SQL sowhen I can just give it a comment andhave it give me a query statement that'suh that's making everybody better it'llalso give me some options I might lookand say that's not the one I want or heythat looks close all right let's pickthat one run that and what it shouldgive me then I'm querying that I'mgetting only two records back because wehave in injury somewhere in that audiotranscription which is awesome slickslick slick yeah so notice how wefigured out the table structure I didn'ttell it anything right we went fromunstructured Blobs of audio data tosomething that we as quasi SQL develvelers can actually get real insight onjust a couple of minutes I mean we canset the bar higher than that Richard wecan get after it we should you know puton our analyst hats the hell's ananalyst hat is it like a fedora Cowboyor Carmen San Diego something like thatso let's see if we can transform thisdata into something more useful I wantto get out one of the big query studionotebooks for thisworkload yeah buckle up so in thisnotebook we can interact with structuredand unstructured data in a single dataframe using big query data frames thisprovides a pandas interface so and itpushes that work to Big query instead ofmaking us have a big large instancesitting around with tons of gigs ofmemory right so in this example we'regoing to use big query data frames butlook I could use sparkk data frames ifthat was a better fit back to your opensource thing it's just about using theright compute for the right workload Iget and I hope you are too so excitedabout this combination of Open Sourceand managed tooling like yep give mespark as the execution engine if that'swhat I want alongside big query as adata repository or if I want to finetune in llm and pytorch you know Cloudtpus now support that I mean I couldbring in data from Apache Iceberg now ifI want to simmer down big man I meanit's fun it's a lot super pumped I'mgonna make you even happier though whichis is troublesome I have some data inApache Iceberg right here and so what Iwant to do I've got this loaded in acloud storage bucket and I want to thengo ahead and take the output of our dataalso going back into aache Icebergformat to keep with our Lake principleshere so we have this managed tableterrific we've got some data in fromthat table if I pull out this data framereference we can actually see the datathat's in here it's a list ofSupervisors terrific let's go ahead andput that back in there stop breakingstuff we'll go ahead and run that loadthat into the data frame so there wehave our structured data we also havethat unstructured data right all thataudio stuff right and so we've got thatall together which is terrific and thenwe'd be able to join this later so Icould join this into information I couldfilter it down see which warehouses havewhich incidents and so forth and theneven identify the risky supervisors byfigure out which supervisors were inwhich ones of these facilities and lookat steuart and Kyle time for a littleextra training I always knew Kyle wasgoing to be a problem sketchy guy so bigL manage tables look we can enable thisand interact with this data just like abig query table which is awesome and asyou talked about before security is alsomanaged at the metadata layer so we cankeep row and column data access controlsconsistent across the data no matter theformatter type we have to keep the safepath the happy path people it is theonly way I think you actually do saythat yeah that's a thing say that so asyou saw we combined all the data heregot it got it processed and now it'senough information that we can work withnow so good so by joining this we havenew information new insight that'sterrific let's go ahead and then seethat next step how do we do a littlemore here sure so if I'm thinking abouthow to filter this information maybe wecould use python to send the list to ourtraining team get them enrolled y dothat as well it's it's not just aboutcosmetically improving the developerexperience this is this is time andmoney right it's time to First Insightis always our goal uh you know ifinformation is hard to find internallyokay everybody at home great hands upyou have all the information you needit's super easily accessible it's noproblem note there are no hands up inthe audience I mean making informationeasily accessible and useful that's likethe Google thing right so maybe weshould make it the easy way yeah yeah sothat's good we've had some funmanipulating that data but we reallywant to get a little more out of thishow do we get some more value maybe wewant to summarize these incidents aswell so we can find out what factorieshave which trouble spots things likethat take some action make sure peoplestay safe in there so here's where itgets fun look under the hood big querystudio notebooks are built on top ofcollab Enterprise this is the cloudready version of Google collab notebooksthat many of you have known and love foryears so when you're ready to take offyour analyst hat and put on your mlengineer hat what hat is thatuh we can switch over the vertexAI okay look at this this is the samenotebook so this is the same notebookwe're looking at same data frame samecode all of it but now I'm using collabEnterprise in one environmentseamless could you callPalm can you extend that with vertex niido summarization from there yeah solet's let's actually invoke the Palm APIso we can summarize maybe that lengthysummary there and get back a nice littledescription that we can figure out whichfactor are a hotmess oh there we go I think you showedme the little magic wand button beforelook at that I like the wand you know itdoesn't take a lot to please me there wego and so if we come back we see there'sa summary I'm getting a single sentencesummary of what might be a really longtranscription and I'm doing all this inthe data frame again I'm not leaving mytool set so everybody take a minute toappreciate what just happened we pulledin that vertex integration no containersor extra side cars we didn't stand upsome giant model or run it on a bespokemassive instance in order to get itclose to our data it's it's just rightthere it's waiting in the platform forus it's an API call away and you canmake that endpoint available in the appsheet app from Alice earlier rightthat's right Alice is excited we couldjust an API endpoint so using AI to putour data to work is the driving impulsebehind so many of the conversations thatI'm having right now and I I just can'ttell you I can't tell you how excited Iam to continue blowing people's mindwith these features this is what isgoing to change buses everywhere I loveit so I'm right there with you let'shave a big hand for Miles W all of ourChampions all right we got some morecoming[Applause]up and now the final Legacylaw hi I'm or hle and I work oninfrastructure but uh back in the darkdepths of the last Millennium my myfirst real job was to be a programmer onan IBM 370 Mainframe but then uh prettymuch in the first year uh of this jobIBM brought out their first business PCthe IBM PC it had just128 kilobytes of memory you knowkilobytes uh slow processor pretty thinsoftware stack but when I bench Marketit was actually the performance perdollar was really good and so um youknow 18 months uh 18 years later when Istarted as a search engine mechanic atthis little startup called Google um itwas natural to try and build it on topof PCS because their price performancewas still unbeatable and the softwarestack was still pretty bad but there wasthis thing called Linux which sort ofalmostworked now physical networking was stilla problem back then it took a while toget an affordfixed line between our first two datacenters in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale andso when it came to copying uh new webindex the new search index from oneplace to other to another it was reallyhard to beat the bandwidth of a Hondafull of hard drives and I'd like to tellmyself it's going to be okay uh in 2023we're going to have this awesome Globalbackbone where this index copy justtakes a few seconds but you know we haveto start small before we could grow intouh where we aretoday now the other you problem you getwith thousands of PCS with thousands ofdiscs is that it's kind of hard to keeptrack of where your data is and discsbreak all the time now two two decadesago one of the first things we did is webuilt a Distributive file system tomanage these discs and then 13 years agowe replaced it with a more resilientversion uh that's called Colossus and tothis day every single bite you store itGoogle Cloud uh in a vm's dis or in GCSor in a database or in a uh uh Googledrive file is still stored inColossus and now the other problem ofcourse with these thousands of PCS ishow to manage them and how to place uhworkloads on them in the beginning wehad had python config files and and alittle mySQL database to kind of keeptrack of them but then about 20 yearsago we built uh the first version ofBorg uh the system that uh to this dayschedules all your workloads in Googlecloud and then uh about a decade ago wereleased a open-source version built onthe same ideas uh you may have heard ofit you know what's it calledkubernetes that's right and just toclose the circle main frames are stillaround and today you run kubernetes onthem so in fact that's kind of the storyof almostevery software and Hardware uh projectand software and Hardware stack forsustainable success you need to learnthe lessons from the past and you knowso you can invent the future right andsome call that Legacy I call it buildingon the shoulders ofgiants and after 20 years in managementactually recently I returned to my rootsas an engineer and so I'm going to beworking with the Giants on our technicalinfrastructure team to continue shapingthe new way to cloud and all of us atGoogle are uh really looking forward toseeing what you will build next on thatcloud thankyou that was awesome so look what's inthe Legacy today we've seen that the waywe prototype our apps the way wemodernize our platform secure ourworkloads even the assumptions we haveabout our data they not choices that wehave to be trapped in in the past we canchallenge our assumptions even while wecelebrate what came before that's rightand now it's time for all of you to gobuild your next Legacy but don't go justyet until then our champion innovatorshave helped us see that taking the nextsteps toward that new way to Cloud itrequires more than just technologydoesn't it true it takes humancreativity it takes empathy right itrequires us working together in harmonywith a rhythm all right taking cues fromOur Roots even as we tune up a newLegacy what I feel like you're alludingto something specific here yeah listenwe started with music today we're goingto end with a little bit of music so tohelp us wrap things up today pleasewelcome our very special guests blackthought and Quest Love From The[Music]Roots thanks for coming out guys how'sit goinghey good to see you thanks for comingthanks for having us have you here Ihear you guys are having a computerproblems yeah we just turned it off andon again we're fine uh so Quest loveyou're on tour with L right now you'recelebrating 30 50 years of hip-hop how'sthe tour going um the tour is amazingsimply because like you know these arepeople that we vitalized since you knowwe were in high school so to be withthem every night and you know to bepeers like not Idols but like amongstthem is is probably the most incrediblething ever dream come true dream cometrue every night for us that's awesomeand the fact that it's uh you know thethe lineup changes daily is just youknow the icing on the cake so that'sfantastic well 50 years of hip-hopincredible we thought it might be fun toask Google Cloud's AI about some ofthose great moments in hip-hop historyyou all up for that sure oh yeah let'sdo it all right let's give it a try lookcan go so I'm going to pull upgenerative AI Studio here in Googlecloud and we're going to see uh if wecan maybe show a little summary of likesome of the greatest moments in hip-hophistory okay and
