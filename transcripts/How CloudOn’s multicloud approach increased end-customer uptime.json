executive here at Google Cloudtoday I'm joined by Sala tagani who isthe CEO of cloud1 and also Matt wurstaCEO of worsta thank you both so much forbeing here thank you Ronnieso today we'll be discussing how Cloudone helped their resource strap clientsincrease their overall performance aswell as Drive their productivity by 138percent as far as their download speedsfor their client applications reallyimpressive numbersbefore we jump into the discussion todayI'd love to ask a couple of questions tothe audience so first by our show ofhands how many people are currentlyleveraging a multi-cloud strategy withintheir businessall right and how many people areconsidering a multi-cloud strategy andlooking to learn more todayperfect I would assume that everybody inhere is looking to drive performance andhave a solution for that so let's DiveInto kick us off I would love to give theopportunity to our speakers to formallyintroduce themselves so if you wouldn'tmind sharing a bit about your backgroundas well as your business so we'll startwith you absolutely Ryland I would liketo just take a moment to thank everybodyfor showing up at 8am in the morning youknow some of you are you know travelingjet lagged uh barely had a breakfastright and here we are sitting at 8 A.Mdiscussing multi-cloud right it's it'snot an easy topic to tackle right sothank you so much for for showing uptoday to our sessionum my name is Salah tegani I'm the CEOand founder of cloud on we are amulti-cloud player focused on enablingcompute Mobility between Cloud providersright so that's our mission statement atleast as of two years and a half ago acompany was founded in 2010 and yeahthat's that's pretty much us thanks AlMatt over to youum thanks guys and that's all I agreeit's great to be here this early in themorning I love itum my name is Matt wursta of worst asyou might have guessed uh and we're aGoogle Cloud Premier partner and sowe've been partnered with Google forover 10 years for about 10 years nowhelping organizations make the most ofGoogle's technology both in thecollaboration space first because Clouddidn't exist you know 10 years ago andnow of course with Google Cloud as wellfantastic thank you MattSal open to you I would love to learn alittle bit more about Cloud one what'sit all aboutabsolutely so we we are your typicalConsulting shop for almost 11 years nowright maybe maybe more and Counting thethe opportunity came to us through oneof our clients and they wereexperiencing shortage with Talentthey were in multi-cloud deployment theywent through an m a acquisition and itjust didn't make sense or scale for themto keepa teamof specialized Talent facing Cloud aprovider and then another team facingCloud B these are not the same skillsets not the same experience Etc and uhthey they did try to keep the status quodidn't work for them and at some pointwe had to hammer something specializedfor them to enable them to move theirapplication back and forth Etc and atsome point we had to support it andthat's when we knew we have to move fromConsulting into productizing so it madesense for us since then to change ourmission statement for the company andjust be heads down on platformdevelopment sensemakes complete sense thank you Sal andwe actually have a brief overview ofcloud on and cloudhub so let's go aheadand share that with the audienceaccording to Gardner Enterprises areoverspending in public cloud withaverage waste figure of 30 to 40 percentpublic Cloud promises enormous costsavings infinite scalability increasedbusiness agility and the ability todigitally transform organizations thoughgenerally true but companies often lackthe tools and expertise in Cloudarchitecture Cloud cost models to fullyoptimize their Cloud spend and facefrequent cost spikesonce companies pick a cloud provider andmove their infrastructure and data tothe cloud prohibitive data egress costmakes it hard to change providers thereare many Cloud cost management Tools inservice in the market who provide costdata dashboard but not the ability toact on that dataintroducing cloudhuba solution that will help you takecontrol over your Cloud costs withinstant notification and track sourcesof cloud cost spikescloudhub uses AI ml to get actionableinsights on cloud cost patternsrecommendations on cost savingopportunities and automated remediationof waste over subscription of cloudresourceswith cloudhub our customer sees anaverage savings of 68 based on MSRPpricewith effortless mobility of your dataand application across multiple Cloudproviders move your workloads and datato the best provider without any penaltyas many times as you want and get thebest public Cloud price it's your timeto do cloud smartly with Cloud onwow so it really seems like Cloud on andcloudhub is an innovator in the space ifyou wouldn't mind sharing a bit aboutsome of the problems that you're solvingfor your clients absolutely so I thinkif you are in the multi-cloud or maybeum the common joke is how to die by aThousand Cuts right so we identified thetop six challenges that anyone in themulti-cloud space have to address atsome point we start with complexityum Cloud operations as it is in a singlecloud provider is already a very complexoperation I to give an example Cloud agot more than 177 services and Countingright and that's just one cloud providerright so imagine if you have on-premplus multiple of the others as wellright so inherently complex operationand that only increases with themulti-cloud deployments you have ashortage of talent we spoke about thatwas actually the reason why thisplatform was put together in the firstplace is that we don't want to Silo theengineering right so it made sense tojust put one platform forward it'sconsistent interface for the people whoare going to be flying this systemum so if you spend any time with theengineers they will tell you that theapis are different the GUI is differentthe consoles are different the sdks aredifferent rightum so it's it's complexsilent Talent just those two challengeswill drive your cost up significantlyright so now you got three on the leftside these are very logicalthen you have on the right side threemore problems that comes from flying amulti-cloud operation observabilitybecomes a real problem how do I look atall the resources in my Enterprise endto end that's gone right you're toolingwhich worked for cloud a might not workfor Cloud B it might not work for youron-prem right so right there yourlicenses model could be different yourspending models could be different yourtroubleshooting skills will have to bedifferent right you might in some casescomprise or put together a team that'smulti-cloud that connects to singleteams facing single Cloud providers soit's it's notoriousum and it makes sense that we have therise of observability as a businessright today you have people like I don'twant to name names right but the entirecompany is out out there now all they dois observability right so it's it's thatum that kind of challenge you still havecapacity Your Capacity won't multiplyright whether it's capacity planningthat's still a problem in themulti-cloudum how do I make sure that by the time Iexhausted my resources in Cloud a CloudB is not suffering right that thecoordination becomes a problem you'realso dealing with enormous amount ofdata being sent at you for multiplesources uh questions likethe the source of Truth which uh whichstory should I believe right if I'mlooking at different dashboards and eachcloud provider is giving me a differentstory right uh of course your outagesare going to be extended yourtroubleshooting is far more complex whatyou used to fix in an hour now couldtake a day rightum and the last one is energy when weput this platform together we we werethe same folks that used to dodeployment after deployment consultationafter the other and we knew that not alldata centers are born the same right soyour headquarter could be a differentsize from yourum Dr by the time you fail over youcould very much discover that I don'thave enough capacity in that particularcabinet in terms ofenergy right sorry in terms ofhydro in terms of cooling right soenergy becomes a focus when when you'reunify The View and the operation youmight send something to the cloud easilybut to bring it back on-prem maybe yourcabinets are exhausted already so weknew from from the beginning that uhthese six challenges need to beaddressed in the platform we didn't wantthe clients to haveour platform and then piecemeal all theother uh big challenges so we thought wehave done a pretty good job addressingthe top six and it doesn't end there forthe multi-cloud but this is as far aswe're able to push so farit makes sense and that sounds like somevery Hefty problems to try to tackle soif you wouldn't mind sharing a bit aboutwhere does cloud owning cloudhub come inas far as solving for some of thesechallengeswell we we built a flat from the fromthe view from inside out on four pillarsor four big compartments first we had tocentralize the operation itself you musthave a consistent interface to deployand to tear down these resources rightand of course sending them back andforth between the cloud providers andon-prem right you can do Cloud to Cloudyou can do Cloud to on-prem and viceversa you could use the platform to failover between the clouds on outages onschedule if you enable a policy likefollow the night we will send theworkload to whichever time zone that thedata center is experiencing off peakhours right so that's for non-criticalworkloads of course for tier oneworkloadsthe mobility might have to be limited tooutages and not scheduled rightso you can you can use the platform uhfrom that point of view it's it's asingle interface that controls more than20 different Cloud providers so far thatwe integrated with the underlyingtechnology we have Giants who give usthe fiber required for the capacity wehave Equinox and we have console connectconstant connect for example they have17 of the internet traffic flows throughtheir backbones right so we have we haveenough for the logical ring to stay upno matter how the capacity would changeyou have Equinox of course the NASDAQ isa tenant for for these folks so we'revery pleased that they even consider towork with us but we're in a good placeinfrastructure wise so that's thecentralizedinfrastructure interface after thatpillar 2 we know thatwith with all the troubleshootingobservability and enormous amount ofdata being sent to you you needanalytics rightso we didn't want our our SMB clients toto acquire the platform and then getstuck with the analytics so the platforminclude a built-in analytics we arebased on a looker Google Cloud right ifyou're wondering but you also have twomore options so coming from a backgroundof Consulting at our shop we knew thatyou have an Roi in place you have aninvestment in place so if that happenedto be the case you still have Splunkright so if your team is comfortableflying a Splunk analytics then we justplug into that right we just put themodule in a in aa pass throughand we will pass all the data over to tothe Splunk engine right you also havegraphano for the lower tierand the non-mission critical for Missioncritical you need to be on lookerthen we havepillar number three we also need tocentralize security right your IMcredentials in Cloud a Cloud B Cloud Cand so on need to be consistent rightyour policies need to be consistentespecially when you move a workload overhey what happened to my firewall ruleswhat what happens to my you know therbac the um all the permissions thatneed to go and follow that workload isum is taken care by by the platform sothe platform had to have built-insecurity we are lucky enough toum have full integration with acheckpoint security they are the largestr dSecurity operation on the planet so thefact that again we're lucky thatthey they decided that this is this is aplatform they would like to integratewith so so that's that's that now that'son the technology side uh we could havenever been able to do this without thesupport from Arista I mean we're we'renot a massive organization soumthank you Matt for for the support sothat that puts the wrapping One supportcontract around the whole operationum and that put hopefully some morechoices in your hands as far asacquiring the technology and acquiringthe infrastructure behind it soum if your local Telco is giving youtrouble with your circuits maybe give usa call and we'll Bridge you into ourlogical ring and we'll give you accessto all of these Cloud providersman off to you so these are the yeah bigfour I'm sorry did I stretched thin noit's good and it makes a lot of senseand a great segue so Matt I would loveto hear from you as well you work with alot of organizations and I'd love tounderstand are these problems and eventhe solution that cloud on is providingare they Universal to what you're seeingwith a lot of the customers that youengage withyes and so folks he's way too kind thisis a really really smart man right hereuh and and we were excited when we firstmet Alan we heard about the the cloud onproduct becauseincreasingly for all of the reasons he'smentioned and many more we findourselves in situations where ourcustomers and yourselves right havemulti-cloud challenges right you'veended up whether it's because ofdeveloper sprawl or it's a Dr strategyor an emerging acquisition or whateverthe your workload span multipleproviders or even on-prem and othervarious areasand we we find increasingly over thelast 18 months that people are thinkingmore and more about how to make surethat their Disaster Recovery or theirresilience plans include a multi-cloudapproach so that they can be especiallyfor tier one workloads right as youmight imagine in regulated Industriesthings like Finance how can you makesure that you have the highestresilience and the lowest RTO that youcan possibly have for your applicationsand so across the customer base and whatwe see in the market right now this is athis is a big needum I would almost I would almost want topull anybody anybody else feel the samepain you guys want to be able to moveworkloads back and forth and andgoodabsolutely perfect thank you for sharingyour experience Matt and Sal I'd like toturn it back over to you so could youshare a bit about how you got startedwith Google cloud and where's the howdid we get here right soum given our size we did not have astrategy to work with the cloudproviders directly and we didn't want todo that actually we wedidn't want to lose or compromise on ourneutrality to the cloud providers and weknew that some Cloud providers if if weengage directly with them they would belike you developed for us and us onlyright and we just we just didn't see thepoint you're going to develop amulti-cloud platform only to work withone Cloud I mean it doesn't make senserightso we engage directly with the with theclients right most of what you see andwhat you experience every day with theplatform is directly driven by customerfeedback and not the cloud providersuntilwe had a touch point withum with Google cloud and they suggestedthat we we get engaged directly withsome of their product managers andRyland here have beenabsolutely driving that effort thank youvery much Rylan and it was a pleasantsurprise we found a cloud providerfinally that understand our missionstatement our value proposition andready to cater to our needs it's not theother way around right sogiven their size we walk in and it'slike the candy store right I mean it's amassive catalog so many Lego pieces thatwe can use to build with and to solveall our problemsum they've been very very kind andsupportive of the whole effort and theresults speaks for themselves wedeveloped more than six modules forGoogle cloudand I kid you not and what used to takea six months in our own maybe was waswas cut down to one month uh indevelopment effort right and again wecould have not done it without thesupport of Arista uh behind the sceneso yeah it's absolutely massive now onthe architectural side uh one of thethings that also cut back ourdevelopment time is the easyarchitecture from the get-go to give oneexample for the technical folks in thein the in the in the crowdthe fact that the vpcs at Google areGlobal resource isum is huge impact on our architecturewe knew it from the outside so of coursewe sat with their teams and the Insightis isjust made it more easy for uscompared to the other Cloud providerswhere they have the VPC provisionedregionally and then you still have to douh appearing between the differentregions and you still have to take careof routing you still have to take careof a whole bunch of stuffjust a simple decision like that in theoverall architecture could affect theentire stack all the way up to the layer7 the actual application right that'sdelay that's complexity that'sa harder troubleshooting and harderfixes right sometimes you fix oneproblem only to introduce anotherso we founded a very very intuitive toto develop the modules for Google it wasa lot faster for usthe other thing that we noticewith with Google cloud from the insideoutwe are right for the Simplicity and thesupport on the development cycle but wealso saw a significant uptick for theperformance right we are in the businessof moving application back and forth andit's the same code that we run over onthe other cloud and all of a sudden youhave this this uptick in performanceright so the platform covers you as faras the app time but the infrastructureis far more responsive and in my opinionit's it's the it's the genius in thedesign of the infrastructure and all theeffort that went into making sure thatthe design makes sense for thedevelopers and the architect later onum so these are I I believe my two bigumexperience as a developer of a platformwith Google cloud and of course againum when you're short staffed in terms oftalent you can always rely on folks likeForesta math team here absolutelyphenomenal they can come in and argumentthose gaps for you if you if you need toabsolutely it takes a village to besuccessful and it sounds like it'simperative to have a strong partneralongside of you so Matt back to you Iwould love to learn a little bit moreabout what exactly does working with apartner at Google Cloud what does Intelthanks everyone yeah and and solitelydescribed it really well I'll try to sumit up into a few list words the thepartner experience our job as partnersin the ecosystem both for folksdeveloping a platform like like Sal andCloud on or for teams that are trying tomanage their Google Cloud footprint oreven workspace is tocontain all of the knowledge youpossibly can to be the experts aboutGoogle and their Cloud products so thatyou don't have to have that full-timeexpertise on staff right in manyorganizations just don't have a centerof excellence entirely dedicated onGoogle's cloud and their products that'swhat we do right and so in finding andfinding a great partneryou should you should experience twothings very specifically you should seethat there's a acceleration in theamount of time or the I guess a decreasein the amount of time that it takes youto bring your product to marketer tochange the thing that you're doinginside your infrastructure to optimizeto become better to get your workloadsin the in the place that they need to beand you should experience decreased riskright the role of the partner is to helpyou Ensurethat you're deploying expertisein the specific product area so that youyou can lower your risk for yourworkload or for your particular projectand so from a from a worser perspectiveand frankly from any of the partnershere right you'll see many partnersdownstairs in the Expo floor they'rethey're all you know specificspecialized and excited and very umspecifically oriented towards differentthings but their goal is to help you asorganizations make sure that you have anacceleration of what you want to getdone and a decrease in the risk whiledoing it and I think that's reallyimportant sometimes the partner stigmahangs out there right if your partner'snot doing that you have the wrongpartner but that's the experience thatyou should have that's what you shouldsee inside your your organization as youpartner upabsolutely thank you Mattthat brings us to one of our finalquestions for our speakers today so I'dlove to understand as you've beenworking with Google Cloud across the fewmonths of our journey what are some ofthe things that stood out as far as theoutcomes that you've been able to driveand what results have you been able toachievewell from development point of view ourdevelopment time was cut down at leastby 50 percent and that's a realisticnumber right the the actual numbers areactually more than that right our endclients do see the performancedifference the Delta is positive and insome cases it doubled the performance byrunning the same code over on the GoogleCloud right so I think these are theseare tangible measurable outcomes thatcontributes hopefully to the value ofthe business whether for us or for ourend clients rightabsolutelyamazing and Matt anything else that youwant to add for us it's been anincredible journey with Sal and his teamand trying to ensure thatum you know to my point earlier he'she's got the right expertise to deployand and support Google Cloud as part ofthe cloud on and cloudhub platform andas you mentioned earlier in thepresentation you know we continue tomake that platform better thanleveraging Google's technology so we'vepartnered on things like looker right toensure that the analytics are there andthe observability is there so it's beengreatthanks Matt thank you Sal absolutely andI'm sure all of you all in the audienceare wondering is this true can I reallymigrate my workload to my applicationthis effectively and efficiently thegood news is that Sal and Cloud on haveput together a special offer for you allin the audience so you all will be ableto have the product in your hands forone year and so I would love to hear ifthere's anything else that you wouldlike to share with the audience aboutthis exclusive offer oh absolutelyRyland so um if you go to our websiteour tagline is multi-cloud for busyteams so it didn't make sense for us todo the typical 30 daysand put it in the hands of an alreadybusy team they're already doingsomething right so it doesn't make sensethat they test on 30 days and arrive ata crucial decision like that so it's wethought let the end clients uh live withthe product for one year in theenvironment work on the pace of the endclient again we're the same folks thatwe used to do deployments right for morethan 10 years so we understand all theheavy lifting that happens inside any ofthese organizations right we don't wantto become a burden by bringing theplatform over we want you to deploy itand we would work at your pace one yearis we believe is sufficient to testdrive the technology and measure foryourself the the uptick in in efficiencyaround the multi-cloud operation rightso um one year I thought it's it's fairenough for everybody to arrive at a fairdecision aboutwhat is this platform and how could itbe utilized best within yourorganizationabsolutely making it very easy for youall to see these performance games thatwe talked about here on this stagethanks again for the time if you couldwe really appreciate your feedback and Ihope that you all enjoy the rest of yourtime here at next[Applause]"
