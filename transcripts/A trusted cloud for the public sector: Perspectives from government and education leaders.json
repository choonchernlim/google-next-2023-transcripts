but uh just want tomake sure you're here for the trustedCloud for the public sector a lot ofgreat discussions that we intend to havebut I'm I'm very excited to be here andI'm glad that you're here tooum so let's uh let's let's get startedum so firstI want to ask the folks some lightninground questions to get to know youbetter before we do these these thesethings so the first one isbetweencomic strips and movies and the MarvelUniverse ones which one do you prefer soKevin we'll start with you which one doyou preferableMarvel okay Marvel marble that was easybecause mine's Marvel too so that was apretty easy one there right okay uh nextlightning round questionum Moon shots or minimal viable productsKevinminimum minimal valuable product minimumvaluable files okay all right MVP allrightI'm going to go with a hybrid betweenthe two the hybrid does that work okayno that's cool and I'm an MVP guy eventhough I work at Google and then we'resupposed to talk about boom shots but Itry to be pretty uh pretty fair abouttrying to get things done so we can moveforwardum okay and then the the next questionis uh Beyonce or Taylor SwiftBeyonce Beyonce oh I'll go with TaylorSwift but back in the day when she wasmore country More Country okay so youall know Beyonce's uh at the LeviStadium tonight yeahand Taylor Swift was at least Levi'sStadium at the end of July and why do Iknow that because my three kids went tothe Taylor Swift concert so I'mobviously on the Taylor Swift side and Iwould tell you those ticket concerts atleast from my perspective are reallyexpensiveum and then they really get you on themerch so even though the concert was ona Thursday uh sorry on a Friday theycalled me up and said hey Dad you gottabring us to the uh the stadium Thursdayso we could stand in line for threehours to buy merchandise for the concertthat starts the next day so Taylor Swifthas her own economic ability to do thesethings so so thereum all right and the last lightninground one is if you could have anysuperpowerany superpower in the future what wouldit be and why okayI got to fly fly okay that's pretty coolyeah I just I don't know why I just hadto fly okay all rightuh teleportationteleportation and whyis being able to like blink and getanywhere with you know save save on somecommute timeall right cool all right all right greatI actually don't have a superpower thatI would like to have because I'm prettyhappy with my lifebut but those are all really goodanswers all right so let's get goingum so I'm here with uh some great folkswe're going to do a little bit ofintroductions but I also want to talk abit aboutum what we're going to be doing today soKevin Haynes is from is the CEO ofcybrary and he does a lot of great stuffin the Cyber training Worldum he's been a CEO of other companiesand I'll let you talk about that when weget to you and then uh Chad's gonna is achat Bratton is from uh the Californiaoffice of data and Innovation and he'sgoing to talk about the empowerment thathe's doing for the State of Californiaso this is really great and I'm thankfulfor both both of you to be here andwe're gonna have a have a greatdiscussion todayso here's our our little agenda whatwe're going to go through we'll do ourwelcoming and then uh Kevin will talkand then Channel talk and then we'regonna have a panel discussion of somequestions that we can hopefullyum bring some some thought leadership towhat's going on uh todayall right so welcome everybodyum and then let me talk a little aboutmyself right so I did a number of yearsin the Army between the Army Reservesand active duty and my last assignmentwas at U.S cyber command and I talkedabout two things that we did thereum we gathered information which isanother way for saying hey we collectintelligence and we collect intelligenceor gather information on all the threatsout there and then we utilize that thesecond thing we do is we utilize thatintelligence to help us enable defensenow most of my time because I worked asa title 10 army officer was takingactivities done overseas but our mainmission was to defend our criticalinfrastructure in the United Statesum and so today I'm the first Sizzle atGoogle public sector and it's uh mymission changed a little bit but I liketo talk about how we're doing verysimilar things right Google has a greatNetwork and they have brilliantintelligence that they have to helpenable defense and that's exactly what Ithink is most importantum when I did my my previous missions inuniform so I'm really happy to be ableto come to Google and do these thingsand when I think about the type ofintelligence that we have to enableNetwork defense I'm really excited thatwe now have integrated Mandy into to ourour team because they have some of theother best intelligent agents that's notonly on the Google network but outsidethe Google Network and we use that tohelp defend ourour Network and our data and and soforth um the other thing I think isreally important is that umwe look at a lot of thingsthat are that are with technologybut I think the human capital element isvery very important right so we're doinga lot of great things in technology butone of the reasons I came to Google wasI'm surrounded by brilliant brilliantpeople so that human capital element isvery very key to to my journey about whywe're doing these types of thingsum so I think aboutthe the inflection points that we havetoday right with artificial intelligencemachine learning and if you've been tothe conference you've seen a lot of thegreat things that that Google's doingwith our third party vendors and I thinkhow do we bring that to the publicsector to enable us to support ourconstituents is very very important andso you know we often talk abouthuman capitalwe talk about artificial intelligenceand there's this view that hey AI isgoing to take away jobs and my view isAI is not going to take my job butsomebody who understands how to use AIis going to take my job so it's allincumbent on us to understand where thetechnology is going and how we canutilize the tools to enable our humancapital to be much better at what you'redoing and then the third thing I like tosay is you know to me Cyber is always ateam sport right uh 24 7 doing all kindsof cool things and you can't do it byyourself and so my one thing to the tothe the folks out there is when youthink about the team you want to workwith if you want to gather really goodintelligence most people don't havenation-state budgets to gatherintelligence so you need a team with theright government agencies like sizza orFBI and then if you're going to choose acloud service provider you want to makesure you have one that has a globalfootprint that's doing similar things sothey can help you enable uh defense ofyour data as you go through the digitaltransformation so I like to talk aboutthat and I say cyber is a team sportand it's importantthat we have those team members on boardum before there's a crisis so when youhit a crisis you can rely on them tohelp you do your thingsum someone Google we talk about how wedo Cloud security there's a number ofthings that are really important to usfrom our architecture design right fromthe very base level where we havetrusted compute systems it's importantto understand how Google really wants tomake sure that the images that you'rerunning the executables that you'rerunning are the right ones that youchose to runum and from there we talk about all thecool things that we can do when we talkabout the methodologies of how Googleapplies securityum to to our platform to do these thingsso with that I'm going to hand it overand I'll let you do a bit of anintroduction about yourself because youhave a lot of great things that you wantto talk about cool and I'm going to goto yeah go to that one slideso cybrary is a um a skills developmentplatform for practitioners and thenpeople who want to be practitionerscyber security practitioners so um youmay be familiar with other tools likethat do more security awareness trainingfor sort of everybody in the companythat's not what we do so we we veryspecifically focus on the practitionerso the security team and thepractitioners there so we think about itis is how do we help people get into theindustry remove the barriers get themskilled up help them measure and thenimprove and then people that are alreadyin the space already working in thespace how do we help them progress andcontinue so that's more or less what wedo and if you'll go forward uh Steve oneit's kind of three things the firstreally isum over on that left hand side recentand relevant so we we do everythingeverything we do is really tied to sortof the work role ultimately my goal andour goal is to get people to the fightto help and we need more people to thefight to help and so the the only wayyou can really do that is to make itwhere it's it's job applicable right soum everything we do is is sort of tiedto a career path or to a work roleum like a framework like a nist or amiter for example uh or some examplesand we focus a lot on threat actortactics techniques and procedures in ourtraining so that hopefully when you comeout of uh and do that you put somethinginto it you can actually go put it toworkum you know in a job so ultimately forus I mean we do haveum we want it to be fun and engaging butit's also about really helping peopleyou know performing a job so that's kindof that one and the middle one is reallyaboutwe think of this as a spectrum fromgetting people into uh the the industryto help so this is really aboutonboarding baselining trying to get ameasurement of where people are a lot oftimes people are coming maybe withcertifications but they don't reallyhave the skills and sometimes they havethe skills but maybe not the they needsome certs so it's it's getting aBaseline and help helping people onboardproperly to whatever that organizationfeels like is needed for those roles andthen also retention so we know for afactum the NATO proves it out which is ifyou invest in your people and you tietheir sort of career pathing to sort oftraining you tend to get people whoretain better you have and we know thatit costs a lot to go higher expensivecyber people especially when you'rehaving to poach them from othercompanies we think it makes a lot ofsense to develop and invest in your ownteam and and grow those resourcesinternally so that's sort of what thatone is about and then the third one hereon the right is kind of Boss mode sothere is a there is a mode for sort ofthe management and admins to be able toassign these things and and sort ofJudge you know and help progress to makesure that everybody's sort of moving anddeveloping their skill set in the waythat the organization wants so that'swhat we do we're passionate about thisum you know there's a big problem as youmentioned at the human capital piece ofthis and that's what we want to go makea big Dentongreat thanks Kevin I appreciate thatoverview of what you're doing and I knowthat there's a big opportunity there andappreciate you your your company's goingover there and going after that problemset and trying to solve that so so ChadI'm going to hand it off to you nowawesome thank you yeah you can go to thenext slide too okayokay thank you all for having me heretodayum just a quick intro on ODI and what wedo our mission is really to deliverservices that are betterum to Californians through the use ofdata human-centered design andtechnology and we reallydo that by focusing on not making anyassumptions doing the user research andanalyzing the data to make informedtechnology decisions and not justum skipping to a solutionumif you go ahead and no you can stay onthe slide I'm sorryuh the first uh bullet point there isthe data and Innovation fund we have afund where our department directly fundshigh impact initiatives across the stateof Californiawe do that by working with departmentsand doing a discovery Sprint and tryingto really determine what is the problemthat your user is going through or whatis the root cause of that problem rightand through those Discovery Sprints wemake those informed technology decisionsit's gives other state departments achance to experiment a little bit morebecause we're directly funding thoseinitiatives we can kind of act as apunching bag and take more risks thatmight not be there typically with theirstandard funding and really allow us toprototype and focus on the user needsand making those informed decisions thesecond pieceis really around the Cal secure roadmapthat's the governor's multi-year roadmapto a secure State Workforce and bringingin more Security Professionals into theState Workforce focusing on the peopleand the infrastructure reallywe're also doing a lot around generativeAI building out use cases for the stateand just seeing how it could improveServices across the state and lastly weare really involved in the CaliforniaStatewide data strategy I'll get moreinto that in another slide here in asecondI can't really see what that's like ohthe next slide please oh next slide yeahthat's the panel discussionthis is the initiatives yeah this one'sdone okay we're good all right nice soso I'm very interested in Californiabeing a native Californian and a lot offolks here from Google and I think thatwhat you're doing is is tremendous I'mvery glad that Governor Newsom is tryingto come up with uh when you say secureyou know a safe and secureinfrastructure and and tooling for ourour state employees so we get to thepanel discussion we can talk a littlebit more about that sure okay so we'regoing to go to the panel discussionthat's the both I got about 30 minutesleftand so we'll talk a bit about uh thefirst one this is for both of our our uhour panelists there so so why GoogleCloudall right so we'll start with youum chatsureum there's a lot of reasons why GoogleCloud one of them is really to modernizeuh the State Workforce and Google cloudand Google workspace have a very highadoption and and higher education rightA lot of people coming out of schoolthey're using Gmail they're using Googleworkspace they're very familiar withGoogle and there's a trust there's atrust Factor there rightum so part of that is really to helpattract talent and modernize the StateWorkforce through the use of moderntools and modern platforms such asGoogle cloud and Google workspaceanother piece is just the ease of usearound Google Cloud for exampleumallowing your Google workspace users tosync directly into Google Cloud youdon't have to have another Enterprisesingle sign-on tool it's directly fromGoogle workspace into Google Cloudplatform right so that was anotherreason we choseum and use Google Cloud as the ease ofuse anduma another reason isum really the reliability of some of theservices one in in particular is theuptime check services in Google Cloudwhere we use it to monitor uptime forall of our websites and I'm notifiedwithin you know five ten seconds of anoutage and can can begin to look into toremediation so just a follow on thatbefore I I get to Kevin so when it comesto your Workforce are they able to workremotely or they ask do they have to goto the office and does Google workspacehelp them work uh remotely and be muchmore efficient or is it still atraditional hey I gotta show up theoffice every day to do these types ofthingsour office is mostly remote and Googleworkspace definitely enables that driveyou know we collaborate a lot in driveandum you know we're doing other stuff thatI'll mention later with vertex Ai andother things in gcp so yeah we do workremotely and it enables us to do thatokay cool so I think from the workforceperspective that's great to give me thatMobility option yeah so Kevin why whyGoogle Cloud yeah why Google Cloud so weuh we're always a Google shop so we'reum you know still in the startup phase Imean I guess we're 2019 soum we were at Google shop but we wereusing a different cloud providerum and uh so we're a migration story uhand so why why sort of Google Cloud ymigrateum there were a number of reasonssimilar to like Chad so I'd start outwith the first one which wasumI would say the relationship with in inthe support of the team because withoutthat we wouldn't have probably you knowgone with the other ones and so I justsaw Google being more proactive withthis honestly about you know support andget you know it was super proactive andeasy to engage Engineers Architects onwhat we were trying to do what we wereyou know the nature of our work meansthat the you know what we were trying todo is probably a little different than alot of use cases out there soum having the having that support in theaccess was great and the relationshipwas greatum uh it didn't hurt that Google becamea customer a virus so that was like okaygreat but so you know like that thatsaid somethingum uh in terms of how Google thinksabout you know the investment of cybersecurity training for their own teamright and I'll tell you not all do thatum and then uh you know the the otherpiece of This was[Music]umI'll call kind of the the technicaldetails so as we kind of crawled out wedidn't know this as but as we got moreinto it what we found is that um withGoogle we had more finite controls downat the kind of the raw level and so youknow we've got four million people onour platform and we're cyber securityyou know skills providers so think aboutlots of labs with lots of bad you knowstuff in it people trying to do crazystuff soum we really needed to make sure wecould control down at the network packetlevel not just the subnet level but atthe network packet level so how to beable to do that with you know finitecontrols and be able to control our usecase with that kind of volume we anyparticular day may have a hundredthousand people come in and launch Labsrightum it's pretty special kind of use caseso the ability for us to be able to havethe controls at that level not all notall the you can't do that with everybodyso that's why so so I'll follow up onthat sounds like you scale right whenyou have lots of people versus maybe nota lot of people or is it a very constantthing no I wish it was constant you knowbut now it's pretty bursty so you canimagine like you know and it kind offollows the sun through a little bit isyou know people coming waking up andgetting online and doing stuff but um ifit it's yeah it's pretty bursty and likeI said we've got four million people onplatform soyou know um if something happens in theworld that people need to learn about ityou know we'll see a huge bike you knowum or I don't know just at randomTuesday night and there's nothing to douh it's it's I wish I could predict itbetter okay good but the the thearchitecture that Google has is able youhaven't had any limitations right now atfirst yeah okay okay greatI'm going to the next uh panel questionthereumso I think we'll start with Chad andthere the question is uh how is securitywoven throughout your daythere's many different ways it can bewoven throughout my day um hopefullyit's not with a bunch of alerts firingoff right in the morningum so that is that is one thing that Ido when I wake up is you know check myinbox andumwe have we do have more sophisticatedalerts for more criticalum critical outages right where I wouldget notified via my phone and even if Iwas sleeping but umI mentioned earlier the uptime checkservice from gcp soumthat is something that we've beenexpanding recently and it can be used tomonitor really the uptime of any Statewebsite and that's something that we usealmost on a weekly basis maybe on adaily basisum one key point of it's not just theuptime checks it's any alerting ormonitoring or logging right is we don'thave enough staff to monitor that 24 7looking at all the logsso we're relying on our automations andour tools to alert us when we when wehave an issueit's just a simple fact that we have toaccept we don't have you know we'reeight to five we don't have staffworking uh five toeight the next day just like someprivate sector companies might haveactual you know security operationscenters running all night the state doeshave a security operations center aswell butum relying on tools and On Tools likethe uptime checks and other alerts inGoogle really gives us that instantfeedback as opposed to waiting for acall from a security operations centerthat they've identified an issue so it'sgetting that instant feedback relying onyour automations toinform kind of some of the securitypriorities of that dayso that also ties back to the humancapital part right so obviously youdon't have a 24 7 uh under yourorganization but utilizing the righttools with all the alerts and sensorsgoing off you have to triage that andyou can use Ai and tooling to help youknow find the needle in the haystackthat something is you actually have totake action on and then if it's a highpriority thing you might get a call andso forth right correct yeah so securityis a pretty well woven into your dayit's not I assume that new day is thesame you have lots of stats you'relooking at and doing the things that uhevery every operator does right yeah onelast point I would make on that isum we're also using gcp for isolatedbackups of other services so things likeour code that we're storing in otherplaces we're also storing in gcp as anisolated backup repository and you knowthat gives usreally the ability to recover fromoutages and other services as well sothat's we're always checking on ourbackups making sure that they're comingin on time and that they're updatedregularly and that everything is kind ofas we expect yeah okaygreat Uh Kevin from your perspective Imean you're not running a stateoperation yeahyou're running so yeah I was thinkingabout how to answer I I think that forus it's kind of like what else is woveninto cyber security because cybersecurity is our daily I mean it's all wedo right soum yeah I I think for us it's it'sthinking about what our at the end ofthe day again our mission is to getpeople into the fight and and you knowto help the Defenders help organizationsout thereum public-private Everybodyum and it's you know it's it's there's alot of work to do and it never stops youknow and like a lot of problems it'sit'syou can't just put out one solve andthen all of a sudden you're done you canjust go home right you know becauseyou've got an adversary on the other endof the keyboard figuring out how to goaround what you just did so you knowit's it's it's never ending so we'realways thinking about uh all right howdo we how do we try to you know helppeople into this and it can be a hardfield a challenging industry to get intoand it can beI you know we turn away too many peoplejust by some of the acronyms and thingsthat we use so we try to make it justreally approachable because we've got toget more people in and so how do we dothat but yet at the same time reallymake it where you build build skills andnot just base skills but you have theability to go in and and uh you knowdefend your organization okay and sowe're just thinking about how do we dothat and do that constantly given thatthe adversary is changing all of theirtactics so so just to follow on onquestion is so if there's a publicizedevent that happens and there's a bunchof AAR after Action reviews of how ithappened how do youum integrate that into your curriculumso that folks are honestly completely upto date but understand you know thelatest trends yeah well Kevin Mandy ison our boardum if Randy and police are reallypleased to have him uh you know the asyou mentioned earlier the threat andtell there is amazing you guys have agreat a great thing there here but youhave to think about all right first ofallum at what point can you actually putcurriculum around an evolving threatright because the first report's alwayswrong as you know right and soum you got to kind of think about whereis the thing where are things going toshape up enough that I can actually thenstart start using this for you know on amassive scale so that's part of theproblem but we we have something calledum uh common vulnerabilities andexploits content and so this is one ofthe things we try to get that out48 to 72 hours you know once somethingis is is publicly known so that meansfor us to do that and create contentwe're working on it before it's publiclyknown and that's where Partnerships kindof come into playum but yeah and we don't do it foreverything of course there's a millionof those but we try to take the sort ofthe tier ones if you think about thatway and put those out there so that youhave the training but you also have theenvironment so this is where like a labwould come into play where you can go inand see that exploit you know andpotentially try to mitigate it as wellbut we try to do that really timelybecause again at the end of the daythose are the things that practitionersneed to protect the organization yeahgreat great great great great answerthere I appreciate that because I knowthat the timeliness of reacting to amalicious cyber actor it's it's finitefor what they do yeah right they'regoing to go in and uh exploit somethingand then the Defenders are going tolearn how to do it so they're going tomake the actor move on forward uh tolook at new techniques unless you're notunless you don't have good cyber hygieneso there's a lot of folks out there havereally bad cyber genes and they're stillgetting hacked by pretty old techniquesbut the goal here is to raise the Cyberhygiene so that we're only going afterthe uh the only ones who are really ableto be successful are pretty high-endnation-state actors and so forth so allright let's go on to the next uh panelquestion hereum okay so uh this one's for you uh uhChad and I'm going to read it there canyou tell us a little bit more about howyou learnum sorry how your team was able tosupport facilitate and launch theCalifornia data strategyyeah definitelyumso I'll try to summarize it the best Ican there is a 21 page data strategydocument for anyone who's interested Iwill email it to you it's publicum so uh in July 2022 the office ofdigital Innovation merged with the Caldata team which was under governmentoperations agency and we changed ourname to the office of data andInnovation so no longer the office ofdigital Innovation so it's been a littleover over a year now since we changedour name andum as part of thatmerger the Cal data team brought withthem this the office of the StatewideChief data officer who is the uh thehighest data officer in state governmentand so that positions ODI as a leader indata strategy and that we have theoffice of the Statewide Chief dataofficer within ODI and it really allowedus to move forward with developing thestate's data strategy today we'reimplementing a lot of different dataservices we have our data and Innovationfund as I mentioned before there's thedata science accelerator that's focusedon Advanced analytics there's the I'msorry it focuses the data scienceaccelerator is focused on Advancedanalytics and statistics there's theanalytics accelerator focused on justanalytics and the modern data stackaccelerator is focused on theinfrastructure so that was a lot ofwords really it's focused on theinfrastructure the processes in thepeople to improve and empower the use ofdata across the state government andreally giving State Department agenciesand modern platform to play with thatdata and rearrange it and query it andallow them to do that much more quicklythan they have been able to in the pastare there other any pilot products orprojects you would like to talk aboutfor any of us that live in Californiaand like how we would as a Citizen Mayview you know our interactions with thestate government be improved or any whendo you yeah definitelyumso there's asome prototype sites that we're workingon right now like a next kind of a nextversion of ca.gov the state's mainwebsitethat builds apis between all of thesedifferent uh State departments agenciesCountyum like water districts for examplethere's a version where all you have todo is type in your zip code and it willtell you what your water quality is inyour in your ZIP code righttype in your where's the nearest foodbank and it will tell you where is thenearest food bank to get resources orcreating an actual profile where youvolunteer certain information and thenthe state can can say okay theseServices might be better for you withoutthe user having to know okay I need togo to cdss or DMV or EDD or or it takesaway all of those acronyms one platformreallyumand that's through in connecting all theright data sources under one platformand giving people that one platform thatthey can use to to search and get whatthey needpeople are defaulting to google.com alot for that right now right and thestate should be able to also provide aninternal search platform that reallygives people what they need for Stateresources and and being in California Iknow that there's multiple languagesthat you have to support to get to theentire citizens or anything special thatyou guys are dealing with thatyeah the translations is activelyevolvingumour our website is translated into sevenor eight languages don't quote me on theexact number but we'd like to get tomore and and hopefully do out and duetor Google might be able to help uspartner with that in the in the futureso okay great I appreciate that I knowthat uh we're reaching out to thisindustry citizenry it's very veryimportant California very large isdiverse State and I think uh what you'redoing is just tremendous there so greatall rightum so this next one there is uhas for for you and um when I what I kindof want to ask you iswhat are the biggest challenges facingthe cyber security industry today yeahum well for me at least the way I answerthis is it's it's it's a people problemit's a it's a human problemumfor a number of years I thought cybersecurity was kind of a technologyproblemum and then I just realized that it'sactually a people problem it's peopleusing technology against other peopleand organizations and is it just it justevolves right and soumI'll tell you a little story stuff butbefore my current companyum I was running a large cyber programand we had uh 300 billion events a daysecurity events a day on averageum that was uh that was uh you got tothink about the the what we had to do interms of technology to do that and Iwould I would walk down into the sock inone of our Global socks uh pretty oftenand sit there watch the team and what uhwhat I realized is in those in thosewalking around you know is thatthe nastiest hardest most complicatedstuff was going to the people it was itwas being served up to the to the humanasset there to make a decision make acall and they didn't have a lot of timeand they they sometimes didn't have allthe information they really needed andso it sort of dawned on me thatum you know I knew what we were doing Iknew what my budget was I knew what Iwas spending on technology I knew what Iwas doing in terms of sort of ourprocesses but I was like man what how amI thinking about the people part of thishow am I investing how to get morepeople like this and you know it's kindof a a fuzzy answer it's like well youcan bring somebody and then you kind ofsit them sit them next to Joe or Sue andlet them kind of you know sit there andpercolate for a couple months and thenmaybe you know maybe they'll pop out onthe other side with with these skillsand I thought man at the rate this isgoing that's not gonna that's not gonnaworkum and that got me really sort ofthinking about you know cyber area andhow to go do this at scale so I thinkthe biggest problem is is is still oneof of having the right people you knowenough people with the right skills andI think about this as a global problemnot just U.S problem uh there are enoughpeople with the right skills to be ableto deploy defense and keep up justkeeping up and it's getting harder tokeep up I thinkdo you think that um with the humancapital that artificial intelligence canhelp be an assistant to enable the thehuman capital to be more efficient orhandle more tasks I think so uh I youknow I saw it myself right we couldn'thave handled those many that manysecurity events and try to you knowseparate signal from noise at that scaleso we would have been Dead on Arrival uhbut so we so yes it helpsum I think it can help like I saidseparate a little bit the signal fromnoise and get get what you need to getto the right peoplebut at the end of the day so that'sstill getting to the right people andthey have to have the right skill I alsoworry a little bit aboutum you know the technology that we thatwe build is is not going to just be usedby US that technology is going to beused by the adversary right and theylove sort of hiding in the things thatwe don't know how they work right or weforget how they work or you know um so Ithink about that a lot yeah and that issomething that Google worries about toois that uh and that's why we try to havea responsible artificial intelligenceand you know for those of you know thatwe've you know developed a modelspecifically for security to help usdetect malicious activity the model'sstill learning on a lot of the greatstuff that we have out there with youknow virus total and all these otherthingsum but I think you know we need toreally pivot and say Hey how do weharness human capital and our advantagewith uh AIML to help defend our networksbetter and go after malicious cyberactors all right I want to follow onthis question with you still and do alittle bit pivot aboutum retention yeah right so we talkedabout hey we don't have enough humancapital training is really reallyimportant and you alluded to the factthat if I'm investing in my humancapital then they'll generally stickaround but are there any other tangiblethings because we know that theworkforce that does this is small theyget burned out because there's so muchgoing on they often can get uh you knowrecruited away is there things that youthinkum like government agencies can do tohelp retain this talent because I hateto say it I I'm not working at Googleum yeah we often can pay better salariesif you are is there some kind of viewthat you have from your person yeah Imean I saw that quite a bit you know Icould hire anybody we want it rightum and we couldn't hire the ones thathadum sort of a passion or Mission burnedinto them rightum and so that would be one thing whichis you know like for Chad like you knowyou got a great Mission there and Ithink just beating the drum on that andhow it helps you know everybody is isyou're gonna find people that that'sjust they work every day and that's whatthey want to do and go help that missionuh 71 I think the the second isum a lot of people who get into cybersecurity they they do it not necessarilyfor sort ofum I mean they they would do this on theweekends they'd probably do right theydo it on the weekends at night becausethey're sort of passionate about this sogive them outlets right back to kind ofinvest in themum but also give them sort of paths andsoumdo they love to do different so givepeople maybe an opportunity to go domaybe some uh offensive stuff right umif they're if they're you know if you'reif you're doing packet analysis you know12 hours a day eventually you're goingto get a fork and poke your eye outum because you're gonna you're gonna bejust you're you're done with that sogive people some opportunity to dodifferent thingsum and and I think that that's a littlebit harder to do sometimes in in otherlike you know like a like a Googleexample because you might want to haveI'm going to hire somebody that has youknow really good at that skill so like achat might be able to say well I'm gonnagrow you in that area right and thatmight they may not be able to get thatelsewhere good retention oh great yeahMission so so Chad same question likeretention right so you're you're at theCalifornia state government you knowthere's uh you're surrounded by Techsector opportunities how do you retainthe talent that you've invested in andhired and so forth what kind of thingsare you looking at doingyeah that can be really challenging inthis stateum especially competing with you knowprivate sector hiring andum just the state hiring process ingeneral is a little bit more complexwith exams and and different things thatyou have to go throughum so for us uh part of what I mentionedearlier on retention is the just usingthe tools and platforms that people wantto useumlots of times developers in softwareengineers and researchers will get youknow a firm no from the iso Shopper fromthe CIO shop on on new technology in thestateum but we're trying to kind of changethat mentality and that's why we'readopting these more modern platforms isreally to focus on retention and thenumtraining opportunities is huge you knowplatforms like like cybrary would behuge for for the state to adopt to thestate does have a pretty good trainingprogram but I've seen it gounderutilized at times and I thinkthat's something that we can work onimproving is really making sure that wemake training available for for oursecurity Workforce in the state andshowing that like we invest in that intheir skills and care about growingtheir skillsandumyeah those are the main ones really isjust showing our staff that we careabout them and and we can make modernplatforms available for them to use Ithink that's great I think that you knowpart of human capital is also having thepolicies and procedures uh and theintent to invest in them and Icompletely resonate when when somebodywants to bring in a new technology andthe sizzo says no uh there's often areason and at least if they'retransparent about why they have to sayno uh that discussion can go a lotfarther I think I think transparency isvery important to to a Workforce and andI really I really like the the conceptof hey Mission focused is is where we'regoing to be able to retain people yeahum okayum let's see this next one is is also isalso for youum Kevinwe talked about some of this yeah yeahthe skill gaps rightum I don't know depending on whatresearch research paper you read there'sdifferent numbers but they're all bigum in terms of what the Gap looks likeum and I think when you step back andlook at that just across the not justthe US I think we're you know we've beenat this a little longer so we weprobably don't have I mean we still havea problem but not I mean it's morepervasive outside the US I thinkum number one is you have to get peoplewho are different into this field likeyou knowum we got to go to places that are notyour typical sort of place I think weneed more diversity of every kind uhinto the field we need to be more opento that and more like like looking forthat and and bringing that inumsome of the yeah there's that go on on asoapbox about this but we don't havetime but some of the things that we doand say and the way we label things andthe way that we sort of have acronymsabout certain things it sort of turnspeople off rightum a lot of it's actually film themilitary too so some of the terms uhkill chain and you know adversary andstuff I've been saying here todayum but you know like if you're not usedto that it's like well maybe this isn'tfor me right maybe I have to go be inthe military for it that's not trueright there's all these kind of thingsthat we do so I think we got to make itmore inclusive bring more in and yeahI'll tell you some of the best analystsI've ever had uh were firemen uh theywere police officers they came fromplaces that you wouldn't expect so Ithink we've got to get much better atthat generally uh you know and uh andthen I do think that we need to turn thepage and just kind of ask a questionabout you know I'd love for scissors tostart thinking about this okay becauseyou usually say Okayum well what am I doing to protect myorganization you're gonna you're gonnaget a bunch of Technology answers I I'dlove to say hey what are we doing tosort of invest and prepare people that'dbe that'd be an awesome question to askyeah I just want to dovet a little biton that so so I'm probably as guilty asanyone else when we try to bring cyberinto a military formationum you know we're all indoctrinated totalk about war Fighters and so we haveto use terms that the war fighter willunderstandum and I 100 acknowledge that sometimesthe terminology uh is not the bestanalogy but that's unfortunately how theway the military operates and then asthe military has created a warfightingdomain called cyberum a lot of that Doctrine from the landsea air and traditional warfightingdomains got migrated to the Cyber domainbut I remember as we were going throughuh those definitions as a technologyperson I'm like that that doesn't youknow that doesn't make a lot of sensewhy are we saying these types of thingsbut from the military perspective itmade sense to the non-cyber people yeahum and having hearing you say that I'mlike yeah we might have proliferated alittle bit too far because there are alot of uh military folks that you we usea lot of acronyms there but uh but thatwas a good appreciate thatall right this next one is uh is is foryou Chad on the on the sense there uhwhat's our biggest challenges that youface in hiring your cyber SecurityProfessionals we talked a little bitabout that but anything uh you want toreiterate on thatumyeah just quickly since we did alreadytalk on this briefly uh really it'shaving enough skilled workers investingin the people there'sa roughly 25 Gap in um State cybersecurity Workforce right now for forState Physicians and that'sthat's a lot of work that's 25 of thework that goes uh without being lookedat right or someone is overworked andhaving to look at too much work soum just creating those pipelines I thinkwe need to get into more school systemsand talk about State Employment that'spersonally how I got a job with thestate uh that one Department came to SacState when I was a student at Sac Stateand I got interested in and I appliedfor them and I got a job there so I Idon't see that happening often andreally just trying to adjust address theworkforce shortage and the skills Gap Ithink is is part of it and reducing thecomplexity around the state hiringprocess will help too which is somethingwe're working on yeah is that whereautomation can help taking all those uhthings you have to fill out and maybestreamlining in a bit yeah we don't havelike the the one click to apply fromLinkedIn right that private sector usesa lot um it's like take this exam andyou know apply on this date and show upon this day it's a lot more complex sotrying to make that simplerI think we got theone more question there and I'm going toask you guys to answer it very quicklyhow can organizations build a culture ofsecurity awareness near and dear to myheart as this is a what's how do webuild security awareness in our cultureI like to augment the question a littlebit I would I would say we ought to bethinking about security literacyum I think awareness is good I thinkwe're sort of Beyond I think I thinkwe're kind of beyond that I think weought to be looking for a notch abovethat which is security literacy I thinkreally everybody ought to know a littlebit more about cyber security not justyou know a select group of people in thecompanyum so yeah that's how I think about itJefffor me one of the most important partsfor that is making sure that you haveexecutive buy-in and support and thatExecutives lead by example you can'thave the you know the exceptions whereum you have a shorter training programfor the executive team or something likethatum so having that executive buy-in andleading by example typically the staffwill also see that andand really see that the executives careabout security and andum will follow in those footsteps andthen just um you know backing upyour program with policy and procedureand training your staff yeah okay greatwell thank you everybody that is thelast question that we have I just wantto make sure everybody has a chance toknow what Google public sector does andthere's a little link for you if youhave any other questions about what uhGoogle public sector does but againthank you for uh for attending and thiswill close out the session today thankyou thank youforeign"
