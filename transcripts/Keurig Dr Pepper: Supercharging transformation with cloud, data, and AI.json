excitedum that you're joining us today I'm sikiJunta and let's get um straight to theto the presentation I work for HCL TechHCL Tech is a leading system integrationprovider of services for our clients andhelp in their cloud enabledtransformation we have very largecorporation we have hyper growth and atremendous engaged client baseum I run as well the um we are at Googlenext year so we I run as well the cloudsmartteam Cloud smart is really theumbrella strategy offering for for cloudmulti-cloud hybrid Cloudum with a product-centric approachindustrialized delivery and as part ofthat strategy I am very proud that I amtheum leader for the Google Business unitso the Google Business unit is theorganization that really organize andinteract with Google and at the sametimewe provide and engage together in thefield and the last and most important wecould develop a lot of solutions for ourclients we talked a lot aboutum you know Jen AI we'll talk about itlater on but that's probably ourstrongeremerging practice at the moment will behonored with the global expansionpartner as well something that we arevery very proud of the global socialimpact partner they are very strongsocially Centric organizations we havelarge communities we have a very strongsense of sustainability internal at HCLso what it is cloud smart Cloud smartreally is a platform of offeringtechnology strategy that we share withour clients we normally work on theirNorth Star in their uh you knowevolution of cloud-enabledtransformation we have a series ofmethodologiesum through we say a workshop that isboard to keyboard everything is verymuch keyboard Centric engineering is atthe heart of what we do that's why Ithink a platform like a Google Cloudmesh very well with our culture ofEngineers of innovatorsum all the time and as well we evolvewith a client in their business outcomeas you know a technology and people isgreat but if it doesn't bring a businessimpact a lot of time it gets abundantand not well implemented so that'sthrough our Cloud smart platform that'swhat we interact with our clientshere it's our booth but the concept isthat when you do cloud enabledtransformationyou have different Journeys that youthat you want to take and this is ourways and we call it the smart ways thereis a journey to cloud and that's notonly application actually lately withthe impact of AI a lot of data journeyto Cloud because the AI is as good asthe data that that you have availableand that you can use it in your modelin the cloud and a lot of innovationhappens in the cloud a lot ofmodernization a lot of you know5G everything that is built new tocreate capability for the business andwe have a last way that is thesupportingimplementations is when we look at theoperating model we know look at thestrategy and the ROI so I you know lookforward to meeting most of you at thebooth and show you thisthree-dimensional way that we engagewith our clients in their journey tocloud enabled transformationsso on that I would like to first of allconcentrate on our relationship withGoogle and the partnership that we havetoday together so I want to invite Sonia5 to come and join meum on stage Sonia please come throughso Sonia will really get into theumyou know why we are here the client andwhy cpg and the technology that we dotogether thank you for the support forcoming and I give you the most importantitem on stage thank you Sonya thank yousiki it is indeed a pleasure to be heretoday with HCL Tech our luminary sponsorand for sure one of our leadingstrategic Partnersum that we have at Google cloud and Ialso look forward today to hearing fromKeurig Dr Pepper when I was speakingwith siki she asked me to make a coupleof comments about the retail andconsumer goods industry and the contextthat we're in and I have to say therecouldn't be a better time for us to betalking about the whole area ofsupercharging transformation in theretail and consumer goods industry we'rein a dynamic environment that we havereally never seen before in the industryand we know that on the retail side ofthe business transformation is really nolonger a choice it's a race and inconsumer goods where we've seen growthat a really steady cake of about fourpercent we begin to seeing some pressureand compression in margins and why arewe seeing that well if I talk to many ofyou our customers if I talk to leadersin the industry it's not long before Ihear terms like tight labor markets Ihear terms like Global inflationthe digitalizing consumerthe whole area of higher consumerexpectations personalization channellessshoppingthe importance of more productivityparticularly in areas of manufacturingand in the supply chain continueddisruption all of these areas have ciosand Business Leaders really focusing inon a few different areas where digitaltransformation and businesstransformation has become reallycritically important these four areashave been extremely important to ourcios and Business Leaders as they thinkabout transformation in the context ofthe industry the first is unlockingconsumer growth how you're able to dothat with more of the insights that youcan get from data we're at a time whenmarketing is certainly being reinventedand each consumer really wants to bereached in that personalized way we knowthat with data we can make that moreefficient for our consumers Innovationneeds to be more agile an understandingconsumers better in the changing contextis critical to be able to succeedleaders are focused on selling in thecpg context we know that's in anecosystem that really has becomechannelless frictionless shoppingexperiences are even more important andwith inflation areas like pricingoptimization Revenue growth managementare top of mind on how data can help aswe think about these changes in thecontext of our customers retailtransformation is focused onpersonalized experiences for consumersand customers and from that standpointthat personalization needs to be done ina context where the customer has betterexperiences but also the associate hasbetter experiences we know that there isnow a focus on an ecosystem of data andthe ability to connect consumer goodsdata and Retail data has never been moreimportantthere's also the need for moreimprovements in the areas of theoperations of the business from Supplychains being reinvented all the way intoother operations in manufacturing and inthe store operations as we look acrossretail and cpg and I'm thrilled to bemoving working also in a time where inthe area of sustainability the need tomove from talk to action in this area isincreasing dramaticallyso we know that we're in a time ofcontinued change and why we're thrilledis that we see AI as playing an excitingrole in a very very changing time in thecontext of how we're operating today AIis indeed the next big shift that we seehappening and with the shift that'staking place in Ai and I would add tothat the conversation will have evenmore later on generative AI we seeleading companies like KDP and othercustomers who are here really takingadvantage of AI to create incrementalvalue throughout the value chainspeeding up the pace of decision makingbecoming more efficient and creatinghigher levels of valuenow of course Google is an AI nativecompany and our AI Innovation is part ofthe transformational cloud and it'sfoundational to what we do moderninfrastructure with scalabilityperformance and at right cost andsecurity is critical to be able tosucceed in this environmentat Google we remain working to commit itto working with an ecosystem of Partnersincluding HCL as one of the largestpartners that we work with today I'mexcited to have the conversation thatwe're going to have today onsupercharging transformation with KeurigDr Pepperthank you Sonia so without further delaylet's have the star of the showcheap ones for kdpr[Applause][Music]all right so we are gonnaum take this as a question and answerssessions so that we can all get theexperience ofuhyou know of KDP so tell us a little bitabout you first of all yep so I uh spentmost of my career at Ernst young in theConsulting practice there and I was apartner in the security Consultingpractice and I came over to KDP in 2019as the Chief Information SecurityOfficerand about 18 months ago I also got thisrole VP of Technical Services and reallywhat that is isum the team that works for me we doeverything from infrastructure tohosting to network end user Computingcollaboration architecture andengineering and then application supportand development so awesome so I knowthat this project that we have beenworking together wasum created by the merger of the companytogether just let us a little bit let usknow a little bit why they came aboutand how this project helped yep whenwhen uhto start this we've got to go all theway back to 2018 that were there werereally two two sides of the businessum the the hot side of the business thecoffee side of the business and the sodaside of the business and so whenum Dr Pepper andum Keurig merged togetherumwe really had two different twodifferent companies that had that reallyhadumtwo differentumphilosophies with how they did thingsand so uh the the Dr Pepper shot of thebusiness reallyumsweated assets yes and they were theywere not used utilizing Cloud they had alot of Legacy technology and as part ofthatum it was working for the business sothey didn't really invest in it CurryGreen Mountain on the other sideum was a multi-cloud provider and theyreally were investing in technology totry to make the the experience for theconsumer better and so what the thecompany saw together was being able tobring uh really the two different sidesof the business together so that theycould transform uh the beverage industryhonestly so that they could provide theperfect beverage to the perfect personat the right time so awesome and andwhile doing that they created the thirdlargest Beverage Company in the world sothat was a pretty interesting exercisesoum when the team started workingtogether what were the first impacts andthat kicked off yeah really so I wouldsay that there were really threeobjectives three main objectives that westarted working with uh really it was uhsimplification stabilization andintegration and so around simplificationthe idea was really to transformum to a simpler faster and more flexibleinfrastructure right we had all thisLegacy uh environment from Dr Pepper wehad kind of a modernized environment atum at Green at Curry Green Mountainum and so there was really really acouple things it was really toprioritize a vendor consolidation sothat we could achieve some costreduction measures that we put forwardto the street we said by doing thiswe're gonna actually you know have somehave some cost savings come out of thebusiness so when we started this in 2018the goal was really to consolidate downfrom six data centers and four serviceproviders all right right and sowe took this step we utilized gcp as ourprimary hosting provider and uh HCL asour primary service provider you know aspart of this we didn't get rid ofeverything into the cloud and so part ofthe simplification uh allowed us toleverage a Colo facility so we left somethings in a Colo facility and that'sreally where we staged all of our misfittoys right there were things thatweren't ready to go to cloud and itreally provided us a uh holding place sothat we could refactor them and thenmove them when they were readyabsolutely that's a very sound strategyyeah and then let me dig it so and thenstabilization right we really wanted toutilize Cloud as our business platformuh really so that we could the businesswas talking about digit of initiativesat that pointum and we really needed to provide thisthe infrastructure so that we couldsupport the businesses it grew right KDPis one that that has typically grown wehave organic growth and inorganic growthand so we typically have a lot of uh uhmergers and Acquisitions or partnersthat we take on we've got over 125brands in the portfolio of own licensedor partner Brands and then withintegration really it was to selectpartners that could help us acceleratethis transition we couldn't do it on ourown we leverage uh providerssignificantly and we really wanted tominimize the risk to be able to supportthe new organization as we went forwardso in summary a great platform forscalability and a partner that can movethe pay ways of of the business to givethe ability to you for YouTube you knoworganically grow or acquire whatevercompany you need so take us a little bitback where we are today yeah which arethe project that you have in in place soinitially when we started thistransition uh the goal was to movethe the the servers from the from thesix data centers we had into the cloudwe picked them up and moved them wherethey were so we did not see the value inthe cloud right we really just moved theworkloads as they were uh into gcpum and over the past couple years reallythe goal has been around modernizationand taking advantage of cloud nativeServices things like moving things toCloud SQL kubernetes Auto scaling thingslike that right we we really now havethe ability to leverage fit for purposeworkloads and auto scale for things likewhen customers pound us on Black Fridaywe're able utilizing the cloud we'reable to Auto scale up and then when thatdemand goes away come back down as youknow things like that aren't uhavailable in traditional data centersand so it's really allowed us to to bemore Nimble and flexiblethat's a a great example goodum you know personal experiencesometimes just go to the cloud andinnovate in the cloud where you know youhave all the tools all the services yourpeople is familiar with that there areother clients that they just you knowmodernize and then move but I thinkum I agree with you it's hard to feelthe cloud when you're just taking yourold stuff there you say okay it's adifferent address but I don't feel a jobthe other thing I would tell you that ithas allowed us to do is to reallyrationalize and look at what we'rerunning and sobeing able toeliminate redundant Technologies orapplications that we have really goes tothat fit for purpose and get rid ofeverything versus just picking it up andusing it the hard part is the businessthat's a technology decision we make thebusiness still likes to hold ownershipto say it works why are we getting ridof this uh you know we've run a surveyat um HCL Tech they'll come out nextmonth and we'll see the two Dimensionthe business pooling or I.T pooling isjust as such a Evolution to to go to thecloud so let's talk a little bit aboutthe current situation and the you knowthe economic uncertaintyum has created the need for you to buildnew strategies can you share with withthe team yeah soumas with probably most companies in hereuh customers needs change significantlyduring the pandemic right for us uh howwhen and where they consumed orpurchased their beverages changesignificantly absolutely right our whatwe call is our away from home officesshut down and so that part of thebusiness went away Fountain FoodServices nobody was going to re uh tofast food chains yeah you couldn't buyit there everybody wanted their coffeeat home and their sodas and Waters athome and so it really changed had tochange the way that we did things andreally due to these changing demands wehad to continue to invest in technologyso that we could meet those customerdemands right we had to invest in thingslike supply chain efficiency how can weproduce more right to get the productout faster we had higher than everdemand for certain products right and sohow could we invest in technology to fixthatumlike I said a couple minutes ago movingmoving to Google Cloud really has helpedus consolidate some of these disparateproducts or technologies that we hadbetween the Dr Pepper side and the curryGreen Mountain Side really into a singlemanageable platform so it's reduced ourcost of ownership yeah uh and hasallowed us to really function moreefficientlyand also address the risk of LegacysystemsLegacy systems if I put my CSO hat onare a big pain for me because sometimesthey can't be patched they can't beupdated things like that also with everincreasing demand capacity management iskey and so that auto scaling the abilityto go up and down being on cloud reallygives us the ability to manage capacityoverall and then really you utilizingautomation right yes one of the thingsthat we really preach over and over iseliminate human error yes or or mistakesthat can be preventable and so the moreand more that we can use automation todo simple routine tasks helps useliminate some of those errors that areout there right and then like I saidearlier when systems requirements changewhether it's up or down this gives usthe ability to scale up or scale down toaddress those those Peak volumes withouthaving to be to be locked into aperpetual capex charge right moving thecloud really moves you from capex toOpex and so it depends on what you wantto do from a financial perspectivesince I took over 18 months ago thisrole one of the things that was alsocritical was the formation of a phenopsgroup so so we saw our Cloud costscontinuing to increase but it wasbecause of how we had deployed it rightand so we really we really enabled thisphenops group and having a team focus onright sizing workloads really allows ustwo things one meeting the needs of thebusiness and the function but alsoallows us to buy what we need when weneed it without having to lock into along-term commitment or infrastructurethat we don't really need and mychallenge to all of you guys are withouta strong fin Ops group you willabsolutely see your cost escalate rightand so this has allowed us to reallymaintain our cost structure or evenreduce it in some aspects for work fromwhere we were and really what thatprovides us the ability to do is usethose savings for growth yeah somodernization so now let's listen thethe point of view of the cloud providerSonia yeah what's your point of viewwell you know the question of Perpetualvolatility it's an interesting one and Icompletely agree with the comment ofcourse in the area of finops to be ableto manage that you know stepping back Ithink we see broadly across cpg exactlywhat you mentioned for KDP becauseum with the pandemic that was that firstpoint of inflection where you know allof a sudden Supply chains were beingreinvented they were originally builtfor cost and cost and efficiency and nowall of a sudden you're trying to drivethat flexibility to be able to managefor the changes about what we seehappening broadly the digital consumerwhere they're shopping and as you'vesaid the changes that took place inconsumer shopping habits through thepandemic so from the peak of thepandemic I think the general thinkingwas we'd get into this new normal butthat has not happened right where inthis period of Perpetual volatilitythat's been taking place and to be ableto manage that volatility the importanceof just being able to accelerate thattransformation and modernization hasbeen critical for cpgs to transform andand to your point that transformationhas now been continuing you know beforethe pandemic you know retailing consumergoods and in particular consumer goodswas not at the front of the line indigital transformation but today inanswer to that question we're number oneor two and seventy percent of cpgs areeither beginning to put in place thatdigital transformation or beginning toaccelerate it and those businessdecisions are being made faster you knowone of the studies that we've done withMIT says that decisions are taking placenow at 2x array in terms of data-drivendecisions and that the speed of decisionmaking is something like 5x faster andall of that is enabled by moving to thatstep of modernization but doing it in avery cost effective in a very costeffective way and I was going to ask youchip are you seeing for KDP thatadopting the cloud has helped to drivefaster strategic decision making for youat kvp yeah absolutely right the theneed really for real-time data analyticsto make those critical businessdecisions has become more and moreimportant right are we producing theright product at the right time to beable to ship it to those customers rightand soadopting cloud has really allowed us torun all of our strategics insightsplatforms so we've put all of our datain analytics into a strategic Insightplatforms for all of our systems reallyinto a cloud native platform running ongcp that's available when and where it'sneeded right and is able to process thetransactions and the analysis Quickenenough so those Business Leaders youknow instead of getting a flash reportcan really see based on yesterday cansee where we are today and so it reallyallows our Business Leaders to makebetter real-time decisions yes and andthat is so critical I think it is a partof digital transformation that reallyhelps to drive and accelerate those typeof results but KDP has also pulled inmigrated its compute infrastructure andmigrated its data footprint to GoogleCloud how has that investment in cloudand in data and AI really help totransform the overall customerexperience the consumer experience so sotheconsumer experience is key for us rightso sopre-merger right you had somebody buyingcoffee and somebody buying soda that'sone person right and we want to see wewant to be able to provide that customerexperience across our portfolio and soreally uh I really I really see a newtransformed experienceum in a couple of areas so first uh wehave connected products so we haveconnected Brewers that provide usreal-time data we're actually able tochange the flavor profile of of coffeesas they're produced based on theconnected uh abilities of the Brewersnow uh we also uh like shopping thingsumwe know when you're running out of whatyou bought right and so we can suggestuh orders we can also suggest hey basedon these other things that you've boughtmaybe you want these products right andsoum how we engage with the customer rightreally gives us an approach to real-timedata so that we can provide a unifiedand consistentoffering to them across our portfoliothe newoptimal Supply Chain management andclient relationship now it all soundsgood but there must have been someproblem someplace because it's thisthing don't happen by Magic sure you hada great partner with you that is buttell us a little bit The Challenge intoyou and your your people encounter yesso I would be remiss if I didn't put myseesaw hat on first so security isalways key and I think our customersreally expect uh one availability andthen two security of their data rightand so the other thing I would say thatwe've seen a significant whether it'ssustainability or what whether it'sother things we really see theregulatory landscape continuing toevolve with higher and higherexpectations right and we need to makesure that we meet or exceed thoserequirements because the customerexpectations continue to change rightand so they expect things faster betterquicker in a secure fashion right theyexpect new varieties of products rightfaster than ever right why does it takeso long to come out with a new flavor ofX right we have to provide technology tothe business so that they can respond tothose demands and soum that that's really what I would sayis the the thewe've got to provide security but wehave to provide it in a way that wedon't lock the business down so that wecan provide those insights to meet theneeds of the business and I completelyagree with what you're saying I thinkthat you know as we meet with ourcustomers more broadly really Meetingthose changing consumer expectationscontinues to be a big challengeparticularly the need for morepersonalized experiences you know thefirst step is really always integratingthat data it has to be in a privacy safeplatform and particularly when it comesto first party data properly consentedthis becomes critical to be able todeliver the personalizations thatconsumers both want and they expecttoday and that data is coming from avariety of sources you know connectedBrewers being a great example here atKDP but it could be your online sales oryour loyalty programs and bringing allof that data togetherapplying the level of AI to be able todrive those personalized experiences iscritical to be winning and we see thatdefinitely in today's environment we'realso helping to improve thatpersonalization when it comes to thearea of Commerce by areas like applyingour capabilities and search andrecommendations into the Enterprisespacethis is a space where again consumersexpect this experience and that onlyincreased significantly coming out ofthe changes that took placeum in the context of the pandemic and asyou said Security in this context isnothing but critical it's nothing butcritical critical so we really thinkabout how we are helping to transformsecurity process and people with ourleading security portfolio because it'sso important to be able to secure yourdata and becomes increasingly importanteven in the context of generative AIand here's the magic word you know youcan't talk about data and how today andnot talk aboutum you know gen AI That's you know somepeople think is a buzzum we at HCL Tech we have over 130projects going on from our software soit isn't it is um aum a trend that is going to change thebusiness but what's your point of viewchip and Sonia do you want to share withusyeah well maybe I'll jump in and say Ithink in retailing consumer goods youknow generative AI is going to benothing short of transformative right itis going to create and open up a muchbroader use of AI really across theEnterprise and and even to today overthe next few days we'll see a cloud nextthat you'll hear from many customers whoare really beginning that transformationJourney with us you know our newpartnership with HCL is going to allowcustomers to get to that generative AIvalue even quicker but really one of thefirst things that our customers talk tous about even before we can get to theway that generative AI May transform theindustry and I'll talk about that in aminute is really governance really theimportance of making sure that your dataremains your data and this is critical Ithink particularly in the rcg areabecause you know impacts not onlycompany reputation but in consumer goodswe're talking about hugely valuablebrand equities and also being able toensure that you're securing a high levelof just brand trust so security of dataand IP is just one of the areas where weat Google Cloud are very focused to makesure that that remains intact and inplace you know but we are excited I'mparticularly excited as a past cpgpractitioner of the transformativenature of generative AI I think in theindustry some of the areas that we seevery clearly and are beginning to workon are first of all assisting in thearea of advertising advertising creativeand content generation with naturallanguage you can just prompt theGeneration Now of text image andultimately video and actually activatethat across channels and that's going tosignificantly reduce development timefrom months into days you know anotherarea is generative AI is going to reallyhelp to create those personalizedcontent and to be able to do that atscale again significantly increasingvalue by impacting levels of conversionand helping that to happen faster in oneof my favorite areas I used to work inthe area of product Innovation now inproduct Innovation you're going to havethat assistant both in terms of beingable to synthesize and summarizeinsights in concept generation in areasof product design and you can do thatwith a prompt so this is going tosignificantly reduce cost and time fordevelopmenttransforming conversational Commercewill be another area where we see asignificant impact and that will drivejust new levels of consumer connectionengagement and satisfactionbut interestingly while customers arestarting in this area they're alsoimmediately starting in the areas ofEnterprise search and that's helpingbroadly functions like HR Finance legalreally across the Enterprise reallyagain be able to assist knowledgeworkers in every area with justsynthesis and summarizationso the opportunities we see here arevery significant and this is real todayas you've said seeking we're workingwith customers in many of these areastodayWe Believe at Google with the Decades ofresearch that we have and ourinvestments in AI the completetechnology stack that's so critical tobe able to execute on this end to endand really a robust ecosystem ofPartners including hvl we're providingthe tools and services that really isall about empowering customers like KDPreally to be able to build and really beable to execute regenerative AI in botha meaningful but also a very responsibleway so this is going to be a a newunlocking of opportunity that we see inthe industry for sure absolutely yeahand I see uh you know I'll start withyour story of Enterprise search and soand and talk about a couple things thatyou said right it's as we started withthe governance at KDP right we've talkedabout keeping our data secure yes wellas we talk about starting withEnterprise searchokay so it's locked down in a containeror in models that's only relevant to KDPbut if I don't again see so hat on if Idon't have the security right when I godo that Enterprise search just say findthisif the file permissions or permissionsare not right somebody would think KDPcan get the information that theyshouldn't have access to and so it'sit's not only locking it down with acontained instance it's also making sureyour security permissions internally areright so that only the right people haveaccess to the right data right so reallywhere we're looking internally I thinkis really across four different areasand so uh employee Employee Engagementis one of the areas that we're lookingat how can we help our employees get thedata fastergen AI around supply chain enhancementsright how can we how can we do things tospeed up supply chain uh document reviewI think we talked about it this morningin the uhin the keynote right uh being able tofor legal or somebody like that to beable to do document review withincontracts or whatever it may be to getto An Answer fasterand then it back office enhancementsright how are we using gym AI to dosecurity or other things within itoperations to make our jobs easier sothat we're focused on the right thingsso it's absolutely therekey and critical to start withgovernance in my opinion and then andthenum roll out from there yeah Google isextremely focused as you know on thegovernance aspect of this and keepingyour data your data secure and separatedso that it's not the public area thatyou want to have this setup in it'sdefinitely in the Enterprise space andwe do a lot of work in this area todrive that level of security andpermissions that are so critical so atHCL Tech we've sealed the moment wheregen AI great technology our clients withchallenges how our employees that arevery curious technically prepared andour engineering all coming together thatwe for the first time probably are goingto be able to solve some of the majorissue obviously in a safe manner becausesecurity and governance but it's uh it'sa it's a momentum that we we feel wefill it in on our people they're verycurious and we feel it on the demand ofour client and obviously the Googleplatform is perfectly suited to solvingthis issue so thank you very much foryour contributionsso we are going toum run a video first and then we willopen for some questionstoday's digital world has unlocked Richopportunities for the cpg industry tobring value
