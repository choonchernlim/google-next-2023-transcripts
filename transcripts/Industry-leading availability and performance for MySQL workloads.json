lot of content to cover a lotof interesting content to coverI hope you're having a great time atCloud next as most of you are awareMySQL is a widely popular database kindof an older open source database and weknow a lot of you are running largefleets of my sequel DB engines rankingsays that MySQL is the second mostpopular database and who doesn't like acute dolphin what do you say so withthat I'm excited to be able to talkabout Cloud SQL for MySQL and all thelatest innovations that you have addedto the servicemy name is sujata mandawa and I lead theproduct for cloud SQL and we'll talkabout Cloud SQL a little bit along withmySQL I am joined by Jeff Sosa who'ssitting right here he's a productmanager for MySQL and also funnymolapudi who is the principal SRE fromPalo Alto networks who's a gcp customeras well as a cloud SQL customerquick look at the agendaI'll start off by giving you an overviewof cloud SQL all the services it managesthe operational burden that it reducesfor youI will give you an introduction intoEnterprise Plus this is the latestlaunch that we had you know more than alittle more than a month ago Cloud SQLEnterprise Plus that gives you improvedperformance and availability uhcapabilities Sosa will dig deeperinto these capabilities showing you someperformance benchmarks and how we areachieving thisfinally we'll end with funny and pleasedon't miss this because this isextremely interesting where funny isgoing to walk through Palo alto'snetworks Journey from managedself-managed MySQL to Cloud SQL forMySQL so definitely a lot of contenthere finally we will have q a so we hopeto carve out some time there's a mic upfront here you can walk over to the micand ask us questions or if you don'thave enough time at the end will Jeffand I and funny will hang out and youguys can come forward and ask usquestions so really looking forward topresenting to youso let's do a quick overview of cloudSQLCloud SQL is a fully managed service forthree engines the open source MySQL opensource postgres as well as Microsoft SQLServer what does fully managed meanCloud SQL makes it extremely easy to setup install and operate and scale withjust a few clicks you can actuallycreate a highly available instanceyou can create multi-regional backups sothat if you have a global applicationand that's needed you can also createreplicas so that you can scale yourreads across regionsno more managing infrastructure databaseversions upgrades you know also worryingabout scaling issues as your applicationgrowswhen it comes to security I think havinga trusted platform is extremelyimportant so Cloud SQL makes it easy totrack control review what data accessyour users have by being using toolslike IM Authenticationit has database audit it supports accesstransparency justification and many manymore featureson the developer front extremelyimportant persona for us with an APIfirst approach we are able to have usersquickly deploy and configure at scalewith the observability features theinsights that we provide we are able toprovide app-specific troubleshootingPerformance Tuning that are actuallyimportant for you to be able to run wellavailable applications it is one of thefastest growing services in gcpwe are excited that top night more than95 percent of the top 100 gcp customersuse cloud SQL and with that I have aquick question for the audience how manyof you already are customers of cloudSQLawesome that's really good to hearawesome thank you and so we really thankyou for your support and for the folkswho haven't tried our Cloud SQL I havejust a quick slide on the benefits ofwhat the manage service Cloud SQLprovidesCloud SQL provides the best TCO so thatyou have capabilities like performancescale availability security governanceout of the boxyou are able to reduce costs reduce youroperational burden so you can focus oninnovating with the applicationsthemselves focus on the applicationrather than running a managed serviceand all the different tasks that you seethat includes you know running a managedservice so we make it extremely easy foryou to be able to innovate on yourapplicationsso what did we hear from you as youstarted deploying we have feedback fromyou but you need a destination for yourmost critical business criticalworkloads and there were three aspectsthat came out you wanted higherperformance for these workloads higherread and write performanceyou wanted higher availability both interms of slas as well as reducing thedowntime for maintenance eventsand finally having extended dataprotection for your business criticalworkloadsbased on this feedback we in July launchCloud SQL Enterprise Plus the existingCloud SQLstays the same no change in features nochange in pricing just a new offeringcalled Cloud SQL Enterprise PlusCloud SQL Enterprise Plus has benefitsin two areas and I'll dig a littledeeper into this performance as well asbusiness continuity in performance wenow have better compute and memoryoptions what does that mean we havehigher memory ratios for CPU to memorywe actually use the latest processorfamilyand finally based on the underlyingHardware we have actually made softwareoptimizations to improve the performanceon this boxand one more thing we do have anoptional data cache that actually speedsup your most Access Data therebyreducing the latency for reads with allof these improvements we are now gettingbased on our internal benchmarks 3x toread performance compared to theexisting Cloud SQL offering the existingCloud SQL offering is now called CloudSQL Enterprise and the new offering iscalled Cloud SQL Enterprise Plusnow let's talk a little bit about theavailability and Jeff will do a demodemonstrating some of these capabilitieson availability but we want to talkabout four lines of SLA so we actuallyhave with Cloud SQL Enterprise plus fournines of SLA including maintenancewe also have less than 10 seconds ofMaintenance downtime if you are anexisting Cloud SQL user you know thatthe current maintenance downtime is lessthan 60 seconds so it's a hugeimprovement over the current cloud SQLEnterprise you get a less than 10seconds of Maintenance downtime andyou'll watch a demo you know talkingabout thatand on the business continuity side thelast thing I wanted to add was logretention we now Support 35-day logretention and hence 35 dpitr a kind ofan important requirement for yourregulated Industries as well as youfolks know your SAS customers you knowthis is your contractual obligation toyour end users as well so two aspectsSuperior performance enhancedavailability extended data protectionthat's what cloud SQL Enterprise Plusentailshow many of you before I go into thenext slide have tried Cloud SQLEnterprise Pluswe have to change thatwe are definitely invite you to come andtry out Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus giveus feedback we are seeing a lot ofinterest from customers and we'd love tohear from you how well that testing isgoingall right with that I want to get to mylast slide which is essentially partnerecosystem you know that buildingapplications is not just about databasesis being able to think beyond thedatabases that's why we're in workingwith an ecosystem of Partners you cansee that the partners are in differentcategories whether it's observabilitywhether it's migration Partners whetherit's analytics Partners securitypartners and many more we're workingwith these ecosystem of Partners to beable to test compatibility to fine-tunesome of the functionality and alsooptimize the Integrations so you spendless time on making sure theapplications work this really reducesyour time and the costs that arerequired to certify these applicationsand make them work well for cloud SQL asyou can see here this is a programthat's been launched and we hope to beadding more Partners over timewith that I am actually going to hand itover to Jeff to talk a little bit moreabout the performance and availabilityfeatures of Enterprise Plusthanks sujathahey everybodyall right yeah so I'm going to dig intothe availability and performanceimprovements in Enterprise Plus in alittle more detailso first let's talk about availabilitywe've made several availabilityenhancements in Enterprise Plusthat really help you to maximize yourbusiness continuity when you're runningyour MySQL applicationsand the first one that I want tohighlight is the four nines SLA so thisis up from three and a half nines thatwe offer in the Enterprise Editionand it's a really class leading SLA forthis kind of productand it's also the other bonus is thatthere's no more maintenance carve out sothe maintenance any outage due tomaintenance that's that's on us rightand it counts against the SLA unlike theEnterprise Editionso that's really important the reason wecan actually eliminate the maintenancecarve out is because we can now do whatwe're calling near zero downtimemaintenance upgrades so sujatha alreadymentioned we can now do a maintenance orupgrade a patch in under 10 secondsbasically single digit seconds so thatallows us to um uh offer that SLAwithout the maintenance carve outmaximizing uh your your businesscontinuity and then also sujatha justmentioned we we've extended theretention for point in time recovery outto 35 daysas well and this little graph is justshowing the comparing the the downtimebetween say the Enterprise Edition andthe Enterprise Plus Edition when we dopatching it could have been up to 60seconds with the Enterprise Edition andnow you can see it's it's in singledigit seconds in Enterprise Plusnow I'm just going to run through aquick demo that shows this upgradetimingand it's a video and I'm going to playit in a minute but let me just set it upso what you're going to see here iswe've got a Enterprise Plus instancethat's provisioned sitting there it'sconfigured for high availabilitywe're going to run a client which iseffectively this shell on the rightwhere it's going to connectand retrieve a timestamp from theinstance basically in a loop over andover again right so you can see that theinstance is healthy it's responding torequests then in the middle we're goingto apply a patch and you'll see in theconsole we're going to go and tell it toupdate the instance and then you'llstart seeing some errors on the rightwhile the patch is being applied andthen it'll recover again and you'll beable to see how much time it actuallytook so that's effectively what yourapplication would see so I'm going to goahead and play itand I'll try to talk through while it'sgoing so here's your your uh your Mightyuh instance Enterprise Plus instanceready to take on your workload uh youcan see here we're highlighting in theattributes that it's Enterprise PlusEdition and that it's configured forhigh availability and then on the rightuh we're gonna run this script and likeI said it's going to connectget this time stamp and then just keepdoing this in a loop and you'll see theoutput of it when we run itso there you go instance is up andrunning it's responding to requests theworld is happy right now we're going toapply a a patch update over on the leftin our consoleand here you can see we have to add inthe instance detailsand then there's gonna we're gonna fastforward a little bit because it takes awhile till you have the outage right sowe're going to fast forward to the pointwhere we actually start seeing theinterruptionand there you go okay so all of a suddennow we're getting some failures theinstance is busy getting updatedbutit recovers pretty fast so you can seeit's a total of about eight seconds inthe demo soso that's why we call it near zerodowntime updates there's still a fewseconds outage but your application canreconnect right awayall rightnow I'm going to turn attention toPerformance and we've made a ton ofperformance improvements in EnterprisePlus and we made some very specificthings also for MySQL in particular I'mgoing to talk about the performanceimprovements come from several areas ofchanges that we've made in EnterprisePlus and the the foundational piece iswe're running on a new instance platformthat we didn't support before it's aperformance optimized instance it's gotthe latest CPU technology and it has ahigher memory ratio so now you can getto an eight to one memory ratio eightgigabytes of memory for per every vcpuso that in and of itself is going toimprove performance right out of the boxjust having a more powerful platformrunning underneath usumfor any kind of workload read write ormixed in addition there's there'ssoftware changes we've made on top sosome of the software changes areoptimizations uh or tuning we've done toleverage the new platform moreeffectively other changes are just justoptimizations in our either in our i opath or in other areas of the productand then finallyfor MySQL we have an optional data cacheproduct that further accelerates readsand I'm going to go into more detail onthat uh in the subsequent slidesso let's just look at write performanceinitiallywe're seeing some pretty dramaticimprovements in right performance withEnterprise Plus because of a combinationof a couple things I talked about on theon the slide before so first is this newinstance platforma lot more horsepower available now forus also we've made optimizations in thesoftware like I said to tune and then inparticular for my SQL we've made a bunchof optimizations in the log commit pathto really cut down on Commit latenciesand as a result we're getting aboutdouble the right throughput in in someof these benchmarks and you get aninverse benefit on latency like youwould expect so we're about half thelatency on a commit in these cases as aresult of all these changes so somepretty dramatic Improvement in rideperformance we run these The Benchmarkwe're running is suspense uh prettystandard you know off-the-shelfbenchmark and a lot of our customershave tested Enterprise Plus themselvesand run their own benchmarks and they'veproven out the same results as well soso that's right performance big bigImprovement up to 2x more throughputhalf the latency typically first forcommit latencyand then on readuh in particular soread performances improved just from thenew instance platform and the tuning andthe other optimizations we've madesimilar to right performance right youdo get read performance boost just fromthat but with for MySQL we've added ananother extra capability on top tofurther boost read performance andthat's called Data cacheso when you enable data cacheyou can get up to three times thethroughput for reads on my SQL workloadsand again running the same benchmarksit's the standard suspense benchmarks uhvery easy to reproduce this I'll talkmore about data cache and how it workson the next slideumbut what data cache does is it allows usto start leveragingflash memory in an instance as a cachinglayer in addition to just having memoryso that's that's the that's the bigdifference but I'll talk a little moreabout how we use it on the next slideso again dramatic Improvement inre-performance is really class leadingperformance for a product like thisall right let's talk about the datacacheso it's an optional feature anEnterprise Plus that you can enable onlyfor MySQL todayand what we're doing I talked about howwe Leverageflash memory now as a caching layer inaddition to your main memory typicallywith mySQL you're going to get the bestperformance obviously if say your entireworking set is in memory right and youdon't ever have to go out to instantstorage because you're going to incurlatency doing that well what we've doneis we're using this locally attachedflash memory as more of a middle tiercache now so it effectively expands theamount oflocal media that you can store yourbuffer pool on so with mySQL typicallywhat you're doing is you have a bufferpool that fits in memory and that'swhere a lot of the query results getserviced out of if possible and if notyou have to go to disk what we're doingis extending the buffer pool to actuallyleverage a local SSD in the instance sowe call it internally a buffer poolextension this is unique to Cloud SQLfor my SQL and uh what we what we'realso doing is when we service a query wehave metadata that effectively canaddress all the data that's in eitherlevel of so we automatically know whereto find the data to service a querywhether it's in memory whether it's onthe local SSD so we can instantly justretrieve itso this is going to work best if you dohave a working set that is big largerthan the memory in the instance so thatbrings maybe some other possibilitiesright when you think about how toprovision sizingEtc we've got a lot of customers who areover provisioned maybe on computebecause they were trying to grow a bigmemory footprint at to to host all theirdata well maybe you have other choicesnow you don't have to over provisioncompute as much maybe you can have amaybe a smaller instance but you canleverage this data cache and still getgood performance from for readsso these are some things that nowcustomers other options now customerscan start considering balancing priceperformance when provisioning Cloud SQLor provisioning for my for my SQL in thecloud in generala couple other details about how this isused you you it's just a it's verysimple as far as the user's concernedyou just turn it on or off that's it wedon't have knobs and things to adjustanything like that you just turn it onwe manage it automatically for you andwhat we're doing is we're provisioning afixed size of of local SSD based on thesize of the instance when you do enablethisand yeah I think I covered everything onthis again it's manually enabled anddisabled at any point you don't have toyou don't have to decide you want to useit when you're creating or provisioningthe instance up front you can have aninstance sitting there and then laterdecide you're going to turn this on orturn this offsoall right and I've also listed on theslide some what sizes that we actuallyprovision for this based on the numberof vcpus on the in the right hand columnsowhich you can also find in all of ourdocumentation obviously soall right and then I'm gonna so so thoseare the big improvements in EnterprisePlus for my SQL that I wanted tohighlight and make everybody aware oflike I said we're we have a bunch ofcustomers that have that are using thisalready and are instantly seeing thebenefitsum again it's opening up newpossibilities when it comes toprovisioning for Price performance aswell as business continuity andavailability uh so I encourage everybodyif you're a MySQL user uh check it outandbut beyond Enterprise plus we have otherenhancements we've made to mice to CloudSQL from isql over the past say sixmonths that I just want to highlight sothese are things that are available uhfor both Enterprise Edition as well asEnterprise Plus edition first one is wenow support up to 500k tables we've gota bunch of customers that are pushingthose kinds of limits uh with the tablecounts that they have to support in aninstance so we've rolled out support forthat doesn't affect your SLA there's nouser surface there's no user controlsfor it it just it's just there we dohave some operational recommendations asfar as instant sizing Etc that wedocument so you know you're going toscale to that level pay attention tothatto get at least you know the bestexperienceand then also a lot of work has beendone on migration for my Sequel and I'msuper thrilled about this because it'sjust making it much easier for people toadopt the product so the first thing Iwant to highlight is our databasemigration serviceas uh addeda large amount of acceleration formigrating MySQL workloadsand so if you tried to use say ourdatabase migration service to migrate onmy SQL workload say six months ago andthen you tried it now it should be aboutfour times faster now to migrate thedataso huge Improvement it's it's it'sproviding a ton of benefit and then wehave some customers with just reallyreally large databases that so sodatabase migration service it does alogical migrationum but it's very automated and easy touse so you point to the old instance itmigrates it creates this other instanceand it migrates all your data and thenyou can promote and switch over at theendumand but what we've also now rolled outsupport for is per Kona extra backupbased migration for MySQL and this is inpreview right now this is a physicalmigration so in this case what we do iswhat you would do is you do a backupwith percona extra backup you put yourbackup files in a bucket and then whatwe'll do is create the instance fromthat bucket for youand that is I call it a physicalmigration because we're taking thesethese database files basically and andimporting them and ingesting them foryou but that's even three times fasterthan a logical based migration withdatabase migration service for reallylarge databases and actually we have acustomer here who's funny is going totalk next they they fall in thatcategory where they have databases bigenough where they want to try usingextra backup as wellokay so a lot of improvements onmigrationum for MySQL we have a really fulltoolkit now if you want to migrate toCloud SQL for MySQL and then finallysome other items that I put under theflexibility category one is we addedsupport for our uh over a hundred newmySQL database Flags which will make iteasier for you to migrate and then alsoallow you to control some things likereplication and performance etc etcand then finally we also store recoverylogs for the point in time recoveryfeature we can store them now in GCS sothis helps you to balance your costbecause we're not using the instantstorage anymore we can put them in outin a bucket and also free up more ofyour instant storage for you know yourdata soso that wraps up my sectionum and now I'm going to turn it over tofonnie for the best part of the wholepresentation this is one of ourcustomers and he's beenmigrating to Cloud SQL at Palo Altonetworks and we've been working withthem really close and he's going to tellyou all about his journey and uh whathe's been up to here you go funnythank you JeffI think sujata and Jeff made you to keepawake after the lunch I know it's not agreat time to do this presentation butI'll also try to keep itawakeso I work for Palo also networks as aprincipal asari I hope you guys knowPalo Alto networks is cyber securityleader I primarily work inthreat prevention and malware detectionteam as a principal asari and we do alot of footprint and Club in gcpespecially we have thousands of databaseclusterswhich runs on MySQL with variousversions and all that stuff we have withthe self-managed running on scent wiresUbuntu and all what not in the centroidSuccess Center site Ubuntu 10 to whereasin the versionsso I joined Palo Alto like a year backand was surprised to see these guys arerunning thousands of clustersself-managed with a veryumvery short footprint of DBS and thecouple of I don't give the foot headcount but it's very very minimal if youhave running a thousand clusters youneed an army of DBS and all that stuffso that's where we start okay so this isnot running a databases on a VM is not aright business if you have to scalefurther and you have to be much muchsmarter that's how we started and evenif you look at umthe regions and all that stuff you knowwe are in like 15 regions and we are allover the world Palo Alto is all over theworld they have like in Qatar everywhereand all this stuffum and our average database size is twoterabytes in average that's a leasesizing actually this average it's leastsize and we are extremely rightintensive you knowum we actually sometimes saturate thedisk if you look at iops of the disk wedo saturate many times and all thatstuff and we write a lot of data everytime and and sometimes it was prettyhard to convince engineering to even doan retention SLA you know you get aterabyte of data every day and youcannot trunk it you know you can imagineuh what kind of challenge we can runinto so these are these are ovary of howa database looks likeumand we do present on both cloud and datacenter we have some data centers we aretrying to migrate to gcp uh it's a lotof combination thereand coming to our influence challengesyou know when you when you run yourself-managedwe have problems of H and Dr we don'thave a very concrete hnd or you know tobe very honest if you do DNS failoverswhich is not very smart uhso we when a primary node goes down wehave to flip the DNS change and tell theapplication to go through the that DNSchange from instead of going to primarynode go to secondary node so that manualDNS changes is is pretty painful notpretty smart too and um when you whenyou run a VM you know it's it's it'sknown that you know if somebody'sthinking the VM is going to runcontinuously it's not it's not true VMis VM is meant to crash a VMS meant toreboot for patches or whatever it iswhen hypervisor underwise hyper has somesome kind of Maintenance the VM restartthat's how any any Cloud works so wehave VM crashes VM reboots and all thatstuff so this makes a business goes downuh and you know and we are out ofbusiness for like few minutes of thatoutage and all that stuffand um we do have some somechances of application data loss and allthis stuff we do handle it fromapplication Level but you know wheninstance goes down it's it's it has somekind of degree of impactum and growth and scalable as Iexplained were extremely right and stillwe saturate this many times again justrepeating the no retention policy andyou know and video actually we end up inincreasing our thisalmost once in a week and you imaginethe thousands of nodes and fifteenths ofregions and unless we automated we weget like a disk is reaching your 89 to190 we go and increase itthough we do some automation around itbut we keep increasing it and all thatstuffumno Auto scaling you know typically whenI say not to scaling you know when thereis a lot of research on certain dayswhen there is aduring a Christmas time or during somekind of promotion going or whatever itis you know we don't scale our instancesbased on the read throughput and allthat stuff you know it stays them youhave to either bring it back bring downupgrade instance or do something else oradd another read node so that's allpretty manualandand when coming to the standardizationand auto upgrades you know we wepossibly used I used to make fun with mymanagers that we possibly used everypossible replication topology it can beGully rightmulti-node multi multi-rite primaries orchain based replication Circle basedreplication we did all kind ofpossibilities that's how it's been builtso we have this all mix and match ofmultiple use cases we have multipleMySQL versions starting from five fiveyou can imagine five five is dead longback to 8.0 and all that stuff and thereason we are still here on five five iswe couldn't get downtime approved fromcustomers or engineering teams becausethey they're they're not ready to takean outage and all that stuffum and footprint has been said it'sspread overdata centers spread out Cloud be weakhop between data centers and Cloud wereplicate between data cents and Cloudbecause of use cases and all that stuffso that's how that's how our interestchallenges are you knowand again last not least in the Linuxversions you know we have Centos sixcenter seven centers eight Ubuntu 10 theconfiguration is not samefor example open file limits in Ubuntuis somewhere else and was it somewhereelse in Centos and people don't evenignore it and we have we ran into openfile limits people didn't even careabout you know open file limits 65 000536 they send it out uh somebody said of1024 and we end up in crashing becausethey didn't look at the right file sothis all kind of things and when you runa different OS you have to look atdifferent places different configs andall that stuffso um and then other things were talkingabout we had when we wanted to startconsidering Cloud SQL we ran in a coupleof challenges and that's how the parconacame into it because every database sizeis spanned overa two terabyte and you can imaginetaking a SQL dump of a two terabyte andimporting two terabyte would take Idon't know it would take a couple ofdays I don't know and it would takethree times of Despair the import isthree times slower than your export andyou can have thousands of such nodes youhave to migrate multiple shards multipleregions and all this stuff it's notpractical so it all okay it's the SQLtraditional SQL dump wouldn't not workand because that's not how it will scaleupand most of the service need zerodowntime you know for example assumingwe still take some kind of dump we runsfor multiple days and all that stuff andthen you they need zero downtime or nearzero down time we can we can convincethem for a few minutes and other stuffbecause they're mounted new new cloudprovider or something like Cloud SQLand umthe multi-node replication multi-sourcereplication and multiple primaries andall that stuff made things morecomplicatedum before I go so another thing was umeven if we if we can if we take a SQLdump for a couple of dayswe cannot store that binary logs forsuch a long time because we write aterabyte every day and you can imagineif I have to hold a terabyte of binarylogs and apply the boundary locks aftermigrations are going to happen so wegenerally don't we into our attention ofbinary locks is couple of days and allthat stuff so you have to take an exportwhich runs for over a week an importruns for another week or plus we cannothold that that might not binary log sowe thought okay a traditional MySQLwouldn't work and that's how we cameinto uh Park on extra backup becausesparkcon extra backup is oror or go to solution and that's how wetake backupsso um coming to the so why did we startconsidering Cloud SQL obviously the fastmigration is the first thing which we weworked with Jeff and sujata criticalsuccess factor of this product is howquickly can we migrate our serviceswithout impacting and all that stuff sothat's where uh the extra backup didcome into picture and high availabilitywe don't want to deal the outages usingDNS changes and all that stuff andobviously we want the cloud the gcphanded that outages and all that stuffand you know the high performance youknow high performance when coming cominginto like you know localized data cachesto see that's what he was saying thelocalized memory which is nothing but anSSD internally uh which can give youmore read throughput more rightthroughput and apparently uh we evenwant to decrease the footprint when Isay how does uhfaster instance can give it a lot ofdecreasing a footprint is when you whenyou're running an instance which iswhich is giving you a thousand iops youneed a 10 instance if you need 10 000iops and when you when you have SSDwhich you give hundred thousand iops wecan possibly consult it into smallerfootprint maybe a bigger instanceinstead of running 10 service I wouldrun one server or five servers so wewanted to even go back and sell that toengineering okay you don't need 10servers now because your throughput ispretty high we can we can consult it allyour database in single single thingmaybe logical database could bedifferent you can have shot one shot toshot three you don't need to have 10servers for that and because you'regiving a lot of proof and all that stuffso that's one other point you know youcan you can think of consolidating yourfootprint because you can betterthroughput and upgrade management youknow as I saidwe have every possible bicycle versionand you know we we we we get an end oflife issues and all that stuff you knowwe get we end up in uh we run multipleURLs for a lot of my secret versions andgetting them convinced to run upgradeitself is a lot of pain so that'sanother thing which pain is going totake off when we when you go to cloudandand I thinkI thinkI just had um one question for funny andthen we'll open it up for questionsum what do you think um and this isprobably for Jeff and funny since youguys have been working together what doyou think actually worked as part ofthis collaboration what are somelearnings what worked well anything youknow I think ofwe we start talking with Google almostevery week bringing out use case uh thecollaboration with Google was almostevery week I was and they're includingus with the engineering directly andtaking the requirements like for examplethe person extra backup is a clearexample of collaboration because thatwas one or six I was being saying that'sa critical sex effect for the product togo and you guys able to deliver and thathappened through giving us a requirementyou guys are delivering it on time andwe are able to test it out even during aa preview mode itself is a it's it'spretty pretty good thing that's what I Ireally appreciate it yeahJeff anythingyeah when there's a really complexsituation like this we found that directcommunication with the customer on aregular basis really makes a differencebecause we can take the requirements ifthey come up uh where there might be agap or something and try to address thempretty quick and answer a lot ofquestions I think that's the other keything is sometimes religious questionsyeah that you guys have about how do Ido this how do I do that and we cananswer pretty quick so we try to atleast be really responsive I thinkthat's helped a lot yeahso thank you again thank youum I think learnings from this as wellas hopefully that was useful to theaudience I just have a couple of moreslides and then I'll um you know we'lltake some questions so some moresessions some of them are finished butum some of them tomorrow we have a SQLServer session we have a best practicesfor cloud SQL we have some DMS sessionslater on today I apologize if I didn'tadd it but definitely please attendthose sessions and provide us feedbackum feedback is always appreciated youknow anything on features presentationwe would really appreciate thatthank youforeign"
