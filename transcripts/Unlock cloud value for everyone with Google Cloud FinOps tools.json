for showing up uh aftera Wednesday evening party with LL Cool Jwe're going to get into some prettyexciting product announcements sohopefully we'll make your timeworthwhile I always like to say you knowSave the Last uh The Best For Last soum that's what we're going to hope todeliver on this session so Milan andmyself are both responsible for all ofthe billing finops tooling and data thatyou hopefully use on a daily basis tomanage all your Cloud spendand we're going to focus thispresentation in the following threeareasso hopefully by the time we're donetoday you will have left with a greaterappreciation for how Google Cloudbilling is thinking about the phenopspaceAdditionally you will also hopefullyhave knowledge on some new productannouncements and stuff for you to beable to take advantage of and thenlastly we'll leave you with sometakeaways for you to get involved in theGoogle Cloud Community finopsorganization so there's always a way foryou to work with us and we'll talk alittle bit about how you can do that aswellso to start with within Cloud billingit's really interesting becausesometimessometimes it's kind of like a detectiveagency a little bit with our when ourcustomers call with mysterious Cloudspend questions so maybe do any of thesestories sound familiar we had and theseare true accounts obviously theiridentities are Anonymous we had onecustomer who overspent in just threedays actually because a development teamlaunched some new custom cores thatweren't currently covered by theircurrent resource-based committed usediscounts we had another customer whohad an R D team run some reallyinteresting experiments over the weekendand left that running and we also had aanother customer call in curious abouttheir spend and it turns out that theyhad resources that were being used bydevelopment that they weren't actuallyaware of and so these are just threeexamples but the spend that wasunallocated for was actually quitesubstantialso a show of hands I mean how many ofyou have actually faced the situationthat Salah explainedmany so clearly you're not alone rightin fact there was a survey conducted byphenops asking our Cloud customers onthe top challenges that they faceand what are the organization prioritiesthat they have to overcome them let'sstart with the challenges that wasshared and I'll just go through the topthree challengesone of the major things that havehappened with the onset of cloud is theshift in the procurement functionearlier in a non-promise environment theprocurement was all centralized drivenby a procurement Department with aparticular capex budget and and therewas no questions about managing thebudget in the middle of of the yearbut now with Cloud the procurementbuying function has more or less turnedtowards an engineer who can instantiatea resource whenever they wantthis change in the procurement processalso means that there is a need for usto empower the engineers so that theycan take the right decisions and theright actionsresponsibility for the costand there is a challenge to land thedata in Engineers path so that they canunderstand the cost and understand theeconomic impact because of the decisionsthat they take this also kind of tiesback with the third challenge that yousee over there which is how do you makesure that there is an adoption ofphenops process in the organizationwhere you can tie finance engineeringsand business teams togetherthe next key challenge that everycustomers shared was finding out theunit economics of what they are spendingthe total cost like for example it'sokay if you're cost has doubled but ifyour customer base has increased by 10timesit's mostly about the unit economicswhich is what is the cost that you arespending for serving a particularcustomer or processing a particulartransaction or serving a customerinquiry and how do we find the unit costso now let's see if those are the topthree challenges that the organizationshared what is that they require as apriority or what is that they requirethe the cloud operations to support themone they want to understand the crowdsthe cost at a more granular levelthrough the process of tagging labelshierarchy resources make sure they havethe right allocations so that they canget to the right unit costthey want to establish a phenops cultureso everybody is responsible for costit's just not the finance or procurementas it was earlierand then look at opportunities ofimproving resource utilization and rightsizing the resources and cutting downany waste cost so that they canultimately contribute to better uniteconomicsyou will see as we go along how we havefeatures and some of the features thatwe are going to announce today directlycontribute to these priorities that theorganizations want to achieveyou are aware of aware of pillars of ofphenobs you must have seen this thismany multiple times in the last two dayswhich is inform operate and optimizewhat we have here is how Google cloudhas productized this pillars and givenyou specific tools under each of thesepillars so thatyou can manage your Cloud business in amore efficient way so for example in theinform pillar we have tools that helpyou view your cost allocate your costcalculate the United economics in theoptimized pillar we have tools to helpyou estimate cost discover where youhave savings opportunities in theoperate pillar we have tools likebudgeting and forecasting that make surethat you're never surprised by the costelementin fact we want to enable a world inwhich hundred percent of cost arevisible allocated and your cloud isefficientand this you will see again a lot ofannouncements that will happen in thenext 20 25 minutes all contribute tothis particular philosophythanks melonall right so let's get into itwe'll start first with our inform pillarall around making sure that you havebasic cost allocation capabilities andthat you can power your unit economicsso we know that there are still primarychallenges here it's not easy and we'retrying to obviously show as a finopsorganization you know how is cloudmaking you money so we've really focusedwithin the product development side onensuring that you have the proper dataand tooling to support this by firstfocusing on making sure that you havethat timely granular cost data and youmight say well Sarah doesn't everyone dothis within the cloud service providercommunityand I would say that actually GoogleCloud billing does this a little bitdifferently we actually provide Richbigquery exports at the at one clickactually within the billing console soyou don't have to set up a big datapipeline orum or a data storage you also getupdates of granular costs up to eighttimes a day actually through thebigquery exports depending on theservice and fun fact within Cloudbilling we actually use bigquery as ourdata store we actually process billionsand billions of rows of data every dayandwe are currently increasing the level ofgranular cost data so I don't know ifyou've noticed quietly this year we'veactuallyincreased our coverage by 20 percent wenow have granular cost coverage for appengine at the instance level spanner atthe instance level firestore at theinstance level and now this month weactually have bigquery at the jobs anddata sets level so this is all availablewithin the detailed bigquery export soif you're not using it you should checkit out all of the granular cost eitheragain sub resource cost data all inthere all available you know all out ofthe boxand data in the bigquery export reallybecomes a centralized data store and itallows you to have those conversationswith other members within yourorganization aroundhow to do cost allocation and how thatdata actually supports the costoptimization activities that you maywant to have so again using that data isa really strong support to start thoseconversations with other stakeholderswithin your organizationnow once you have all of this datastored centrally in bigquerythe other thing isyou know we may not be the only cloudservice provider you're usingGoogle cloud is actually aFaber of the phenops foundation and thefinops open billing standards projectFocuswe're committed to driving open billingstandards and the version 0.5 release isa specification that allows customers tounify resource names across cloudservice providers and to understandtheir net cost Fields but this is justthe start there's a robust roadmap thatwe as Google Cloud are contributing tobut also our customers are and thelarger ecosystemwe want to make it easier for customersto understand their Cloud costs becausebeing open is really a part of Google'sDNA we have contributed to foundationalinternet Technologies over the past 20years this just Falls quite in line withour overall mission and purpose secondlywe don't want you spending a lot of timetrying to decipher your Cloud bills wewant you to be spending time oninnovating and leapfrogging yourcompetition and lastly we really believethat open high quality data isnon-negotiable and that also goes foryour cost datanow this wouldn't be Google next thisyear if we didn't talk about gen Ai andgen Ai and Cloud billing are nostrangers in fact we believe that llmshave the power to unlock the businessand Technical divide that sometimes canoccur when deciphering Google Cloudbills and what better place to use thistechnology than within billing so we'resuper excited to announce ourpartnership with do it AI to bring thepower of AI assistance to the GoogleCloud billing console now you can use doit AI to provide assistance withanswering questions on how to use theGoogle Cloud billing tools to theirfullest extentanother interesting activity that weworked with the do it AI team as well asthe cloudfinops foundationwas putting duet AI to the actualfinops IQ testwe worked with the phenops foundationand we actually had do it AI pass asimilar examto the phenop certified practitionerexam with flying colors in fact doing AIactually picked out a couple ofambiguities in a couple of the questionsquite quicklyGoogle cloud has a very robust roadmapfor unlocking the power of gen AI thatactually prioritizes accuracy first sothis is just the start of thiscollaboration and you will see usunlocking this technology further andfurther within the billing consoleall right that was the informed pillarnow let's get into another veryinteresting areaoptimization so once you haveestablished your cost transparency youunderstand what's driving your costs youunderstand how those costs are workingthen the next logical step is how areyou going to optimize those costsand optimization is clearly an area ofinterest and top of mind for ourcustomers right nowand it's a really rewarding area ofproduct development sometimes we getfrom our customers you know what's in itfor Google Cloud to actually save usmoney on our Cloud billand I'll tell you that within Cloudbilling you know we we don't want yourbad money we want your good money wewant to make sure that you're gettingthe most out of what you spend withGoogle Cloudand this is a really important area forus from an investment standpoint from atooling standpoint so we're super superexcited to talk to you about somedevelopment we've had Under Wraps thisyearumtoday we actually launched a liveproduct today which is super exciting solet's get into it on how to help youmore with your optimization Journeysso we've heard overwhelmingly from ourcustomers that the job of optimizing andensuring that your Cloud dollar is spentis notquite simple in fact reducing waste andensuring that your culture has anefficient spendstill continues to be a challengeso today we are excited to announce thelaunch of our new phenops Hub this isyour one Central pane of glass withinGoogle Cloud that is focused exclusivelyfor finops first I'm going to show youhopefully a trailer on all the excitingfeatures of this new phenops Hub andthen I'll dive into the details of thisspecific launch so let's see if ourvideowill play for ushow do you know if your cloud is runningefficiently the hardest thing aboutCloud optimization is knowing where tostart introducing the Google Cloudfinops Hub your one place for all Cloudcost optimization across Google Cloudexclusively for finops understand whereyou should be taking action on eventsthat may have an immediate cost impactlike an unattended project see whereyour biggest cost saving opportunitiesare across your Google Cloud landscapewithin seconds apply rate and usageoptimizations together the Google Cloudfinops Hub is backed by Google AI itprescribes a series of rate and usageoptimizations to take like right sizinga project and purchasing committed usediscounts together in harmony to gainthe most effective optimization butCloud optimization is not a one-timeexercise real Cloud efficiency isachieved through establishing a robustfin Ops practice that's also wherefinops Hub can help the Google Cloud finOps score provides an analysis of howwell you are using Google cloud data andtools to inform on costs optimized spendand day-to-day operate your Cloud learnhow you can improve your fin op scorethrough your very own personalizedreport additionally with Google Cloudpeer benchmarks you can now see how yourfin Ops practices and rate optimizationscompare with industry peers givingadditional context to your performancewith the ability to opt out at any timelastly the fin Ops Hub keeps track ofyour optimization records through atotal savings Ledger based on appliedoptimizations prove your optimizationbusiness case but most important don'tforget to celebrate all youroptimization wins the Google Cloudfinops Hub makes Cloud optimization easyregardless of where you are in yourfinops journey unlock maximum cloudvalue todaythere's a lot to unpack there so let'sdive into what we just watched first weheard from our customers that our rateoptimization specifically our committeduse discount rate optimizationsweren't relevant to their business needsbecausehow much you'd commit On Demand versusthrough a committed use discount isactually a very personal decision andit's dependent on variables that quitefrankly we don't have Insight or wecan't infer like your risk tolerance andwe heard you so now live as of Augustactually in public preview you can nowconfigure all of your committed usediscount recommendationsby specifying a usage threshold so youcan say how much of your coverage youwant to cover Through committed usediscounts through percentage and you canalso configurerecommendations by cud termthis is the start of our configurationJourney we're going to continueobviously to add differentpersonalization options as we grow thisfeature to make sure that the costoptimizations that you are getting arerelevant to your business needswe also heard from our customers thatthe optimization Journey today beforethe phenops Hub is fragmented youactually have to go into a lot of areaswithin the cloud console to figure outdifferentrate and usage optimizationsso you don't have to do that anymoreactually live as of today you can checkout the QR code think of this as yourlanding page this is going to be yourOne-Stop shop for optimizationfor the phenops communityso when you land on this page you shouldunderstand in seconds where your costsavings opportunities lie starting witha specific service or even a top-leveledoptimization suggestionin addition to optimization suggestionsthere's also quick actions you may wantto take that might have a cost impactsuch as an expired committed usediscount now all of these alerts arecentralized and you can take actionright awaybut anyone who's done any type ofoptimization knows that it's never a onetime and then you're finished it's along-term game and we've found thatfolks that have mature phenops practicesalso tend to be highly optimized that'swhy we've launched our own personalizedfinop score which is an advanced machinelearning score based on how you adhereto optimization best practices includinghow you monitor your spend how youoptimize your resources how you committo committed use discounts how you lookat automated practices through our apisor through the billing exportbut what good is the score withouttelling you pointers on how you mightimprove that score so that's where yourown personalized report comes in withsuggestions to help you improve thatscore such as setting budget alertsthrough certain areas to spend orpotentially giving view access tocertain team members so they can also beaware of their coststhis score also might change withoutyour team taking action that's okaybecause if you're resources are gettingfully utilized by other team membersthis score also automatically reflectsthat this is going to be your beacon forhow your cloud is optimal is optimizedthroughout your entire organization andwill help youteach you how to prioritize your phenopsactivitiesthe other thing that we've addedwith our finops score and with ourcommitted use discount coverage is theability for you to understand how youare comparing to perhaps other folkswithin your industry because we getasked this all the time is this a goodthing am I doing wellthis is exactly why we have developedour peer benchmarks for both The finopsHub and the committed use discountoptimization rate calculationsyour peer Benchmark is based on multipleDimensions with no one organizationinfluencing the score the score by morethan two percent ensuring completeanonymity of your dataif there aren't enough peers in TheBenchmark we simply won't calculate itcustomers are opted in by default but ofcourse you can opt out of these at anytime but more importantly you can nowunderstand whether your phenopspractices are on par for your industryif they're ahead you can celebrate or ifthey're potentially behind the data isthere to help you inform on your finoppractices prioritiesand along with providing a quick placefor you to understand where to optimizefirst now we are providing the fullpicture of how you should optimize yourentire Cloud it's no longer about doinga committed use discount or right sizingand in fact I think one I still rememberone customer conversation where he saidhey your your recommendation right-sizedme out of a committed use discountthat's no longer the case actually allof our recommendations are now contextaware of each other and we've moved themajority of our Rich AI driven costrecommendations into the finops Hub thisincludes all unattended projects rightsizing any type of idle costrecommendationsallocation recommenders those are allnow a part of this phenops huband while you as a phenops leader maynot be the one to necessarily takeaction on shutting down an instance orright-sizing instance you need to beaware of these optimizationopportunities and you need to be awareso you can work with the engineeringteams and know who the engineering teamsare to take action on thoserecommendations so the first stepobviously is a centralized finops teamis to be awareand when you're looking at certain rateoptimizations through committed usediscountswe now provide you with more details tounderstand what it is we arerecommending and why so remember how youconfigured your committed use discountcoverage well now these recommendationstake into account those preferencesand with rate optimizations that mightbe able to be used together such as FlexCuts with standard resource based Cutswe are now providing trade-off analysisrecommendationsall our cost recommendations are basedoff of your contractual pricing and theyare super accurate in some cases wecalculate up from the micro secondgranular data levelso please take a lookand notes that after you apply yourrecommendationsyou need a way to keep a ledger of yourwins this is also a new area that we areexpanding on within the phenops Hubkeeping track of optimizationrecommendations and how you're applyingthese optimizations can be tricky howcan you correlate an activity thatyou've taken as a finops team with anaction that someone from another teammight have already takenwell now this is where the savingsLedger can come in handy because we areCloud billing we are the source of Truthfor this data we compute this savingsbased on your last billing cycle and wesplit the savings by the optimizationopportunitythis is really really powerful and it'sjust the beginning of how we're going tostart to show you how your how youractions have impacted your organizationand your optimizationswe will start by further refining oursavings Ledger byhaving time series data andwe will expand this by also includingadditional optimization activities asthe finops Hub increases itscapabilities so you'll always have thissavings Ledger on hand to show how it isyour team is optimizing your cloudthat is the end of the optimizationbut we still have one more pillarwe have our operate filler the operatepillar is very much on ensuring thatonce you have your cost coverage inplace once you have your efficient spendyou know you also need governance andday-to-day tooling to help make surethat everything stays on trackand we know that empowering Engineers totake action has been a number onechallenge of our finops organizationsfor several years in factand we also know that while Engineersfocus on delivering Innovation and noweven at Breakneck speed the decisionsthat they make may also result insignificant cost overruns and can theycan run through your group budgets veryvery quicklyhowever if we empowered our Engineers toactually create their own budgets andget their own notificationsthen perhaps they can get ahead of thecost spend and this is exactly whatwe're doing now we are now helping ourcustomers to decentralize our costgovernance by letting project owners andeditors View and create budgets forsingle project scope projects and alsofor them to get email notifications andthe interesting thing with Google Cloudbudgets if you haven't used this tool isthat you can also not only get budgetalerts for actual spend but forforecasted spend amounts as wellthis feature is also available forpublic preview so again hopefully you'vebeen scanning the QR codes all along youcan take a look at this and again try itout I think it's a really powerful toolso lastly time runs very quickly We'veran through some of these productannouncements with our operate ouroptimize our informed pillars a lot ofthe times we get asked heyhow do I how do I work with you guys howdo I join the communitythere's a really great group that wehave and this is our Cloud billingcustomer cohort programyou if you join this you will getnotified on any new product releases aswell as you will get invited on theopportunity to participate in callswhere my team outlines all of these newfeatures in detail in addition you willbe invited to participate in some of ouruser studies product feedback againjoining the community of all of theGoogle Cloud phenops practitionerswe've alsostarted a new program tohighlight the great work that our GoogleCloud finops Community is doing andwe're calling this the phenops Visionaryseries we've just launched this and soif you're interested in participating inthis and you have a really interestingstory that you'd like to share with thecommunity you can scan this QR code tosign up and our writers will get intouch with you this is a full blogseries that is being featured on ourGoogle Cloudblog seriesthat's what we have for you today sohopefully some of this is strikes someinterest I'm gonna"
