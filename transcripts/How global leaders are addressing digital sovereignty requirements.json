    "transcript": "foreign[Music]I hope you all enjoyed the keynote Icertainly didand with that we'll start with aconversation about digital sovereigntyI'm archana Murthy product manager witha regulated Cloud organization and veryshortly I'm going to be joined togetherby cypri and falc CEO of sans to talkabout digital sovereigntyso over the course of the next 45minutes we're going to talk about whatdigital sovereignty is why is digitalsovereignty important to every one ofyou in this roomthe solutions that Google offers is tomeet your sovereignty needs and thenwe'll wrap up with some resourcesso when it comes to security and riskmanagementGoogle cloud has a very unique missionand vision and it brings together threekey factors you heard from Kevin mandiathis morning and he mentioned thesefactors as well number one is Frontlinethreat intelligence and expertise tohelp you be prepared before during andafter a security incidentsecond is security operations and notjust simple security operations but youwant a modern security operationsplatformthat actually helps you detectinvestigate and respond to cyber threatsusing the speed the scale and theintelligence of Google Cloudand the third aspect which I'm sure alot of you in this room are excitedabout is having a trusted platformand not just a simple trusted platformyou want to make sure that you have aplatform that's secure by Design andsecure by default and bringing togetherall of these key elements makes itpossible for us as Google to provide youwith the best Security Solutions to meetall of your needsso now when we think about trustedplatform a core part of a good trustedplatform is digital sovereigntyand what makes digital sovereigntycomplicated is I could go around thisroom ask each and every one of you whatdigital sovereignty means to you yourorganization or your country and I'msure I'll give different answers fromeach and every one of you in the roomso the consensus definition of digitalsovereignty is basically the ability fora country or an entity or anorganization to have complete controlover the software and Technologyoperationsof their data within their jurisdictionsso organizations around the world trulyunderstand the power of using Cloud TheInnovation that cloud provides peoplealso understand the security they getwith Cloud the sustainability the scalethat you get with Cloud but a lot oftimes customers ask me the question ofAshna how do I actually balance all ofthese benefits with the compliance needsand sovereignty needs that I have withinmy countryand why is sovereignty becoming a veryvery important factor so this is rootedin a number of concerns and a lot ofthem are not just technology related soif you look at what's on stage here thefirst is security and control socountries want to make sure that as alot of their data moves from on-premsolutions to the cloud that they havethe right regulations in place to makesure that that data is protected theright way by the entities that arehandling that dataso you can see in the European Unionwhere you know a lot of regulations arecoming up this there is gdpr there isskyx this technum cloud in France is BSIthat's looking at regulations in Germanythere's the upcoming UCS so that's thetrend we're seeingthe second aspect is economic obviouslythere is a desire to have local playersinvolved in a lot of these Cloudconversations and that's because ofvarious factors so first is for yourlocal economy to develop you want tomake sure that yourincentivizing local players to be partof this equation for cloudtransformationthe second is you want to make sure thatyou do not have lock in with anyprovider or vendor and third you want tomake sure that you have protectionagainst extra territorial accessand lastly there's a geopoliticalelementwe know that the one thing that's themost dynamic in the world is geopoliticsthings change every dayso companies want to make sure that whenthey have the most sensitive data thatneeds to operate even in the middle of ageographic crisis within their countrythat they still have access to that datathey're able to run their economiesthey're able to provide Citizen Servicesin those cases right so these are one ofsome of the reasons why companies wantto make sure that digital sovereignty ispart of their process and theirportfolionow what we've realized is digitalsovereignty as a concept is really hugeso we wanted to distill it down to threekey elements that help you sort ofanchor and understand the elements ofdigital sovereignty that you should becaring aboutstarting with data now data is the newoil everybody knows this and that'swhere the problem starts right as youbring that data on to the cloud youobviously need to make sure that thereare the right protections and controlsfor that data so we start with datasovereignty which is the ability for youas an organization to have completecontrol over your data at any givenpoint of time you should be able toDefine where the data should stay youshould have complete control over thecryptographic operations of that datathe second element is operationalsovereignty let's go One Step Beyondjust data and say you as an entityshould have complete control over howthe data or that cloud is actuallyoperated it could be as simple asdefining who should be actuallyproviding support could be local supportor it could go all the way to the otherside to say look I don't even want youas an entity to be operating my cloud Iwant somebody else to be doing thoseoperations somebody I trust in a localenvironmentthe last one is software sovereigntyso this is often referred to assurvivabilityso imagine a situation a geopoliticalsituation where a country is cut offfrom access for some reasonand there are certain workloads that arecritical for the intelligence agenciesin the government there are certainworkloads that are required to stayoperational in a disconnected mode inthose situations you want to make surethat there is software sovereigntyavailable for those workloadsnow we took this Mission and webasically built concrete products aroundthis mission that ground you and helpyou actually take your digitalsovereignty posture to the next levelsoclearly you've seen how complex thisconcept is so it would be it would beinteresting to think that one solutionis actually going to solve all of yourproblems I'm here to say I'm sorrythat's not the case unfortunately thisis one of those situations where youwant a portfolio of solutions so thatyou can better you equip yourself rightand why is that why do you need aportfolio of solutions number one notall of your data is equal I'm sure whenI go to my house my shoes are in oneplace but my jewelry is in a completelydifferent place similarly within yourEnterprise you have some data that'snon-sensitive you have other data that'ssensitive and you want to make sure thateach of these is handled in anappropriate fashion the second is yourbusiness growth is most important to youwhich means you determine the countrieswhere you want to expand your portfoliointo and each of these countries mighthave different regulations they mighthave different sovereignty requirementswhich means you have to make sure thatyour products and capabilities canfunction within the boundaries of thosecountries in the right way So within ourportfolio we have three key areas offocus the first one is Sovereigncontrols what we do with Sovereigncontrols is we take gcp as you know itand we make sure that there are theright controls and capabilities placedon top of gcp in order for you to haveclear control over your data and accessto that data within the platformthe second area of focus is hosted Cloudso for that survivable workloads thatyou have places where you need thatsoftware sovereignty we want to provideyou with a mechanism through which youcan host that data bring that to thecloud and use that within the constructsof an operational environment that youtrustand lastly supervised Cloud this is ourforthcoming offering this actuallyprovides the strongest data andoperational sovereignty needs inspecific countries such as France andGermanyso we'll talk a little bit about each ofthese Solutionsstarting with Sovereign controls nowwe've seen that in majority of theplaces around the world this solutioncan actually solve for majority of theproblems that we see and use cases thatwe see with our customersso diving into this as I said this isbuilt on top of gcp and the core goalwith Sovereign controls is it allows youto keep your core data in a givengeography so you can choose the EuropeanUnion you can use like France or Germanyor other locations using our dataresidency controls and the mostimportant part of this is we don't thinkthat data sovereignty can only beachieved by data location we go aboveand beyond to allow you with thecapabilities to operate yourcryptographic key material outside theConstructorso you can actually manage yourencryption keys outside of Googleand you can also go One Step Beyond thatand say you as a customereither directly or through a partner isable to approve or deny access to thatcryptographic key material by GoogleWhenever there is a transaction that'shappening so this means that you're notonly deciding the location where yourdata stays you're going One Step Beyondto say look I have complete control oversaying yes or no to any access requestsso very powerful and when we work withlocal partners for our Sovereigncontrols our local Partners help providemore inspectability and audits on top ofwhat Google provides so there's somebodyconstantly looking at what Google doeswithin the environment and apart fromthat they also help customers managethese encryption keys because you mightnot have the capability to do this onyour own or you might not want to investon those resources yourself and theyalso manage these access justificationson behalf of younow we truly believe that partners arecritical in this journey as we move intodifferent countries they understand theeconomy they understand the players theyunderstand the government theyunderstand the regulations so for ushaving strong Partnerships in differentparts of the world is critical we'veannounced more Partners than any otherproviders in the European Union andwe're actively expanding ourPartnerships outside of the EuropeanUnion as well now Sovereign controlsprotect like provides most popular cloudservices that you're very used to sowhether it's infrastructuremodernization app modernizationanalytics with bigquery you get all ofthat with Sovereign controls so it's thesame capabilities with furtherprotections and guarantees that you canget to meet your data sovereignty needsnow we're constantly adding moreservices we're adding more regions tothis we have upcoming launches coming upin Italy in Spain in Saudi Arabia inJapan and several other places to makesure that as your business expands youalso have gcp to use as part of yourpart of your expansion plansnow let's look at the hosted Cloudsolutionwe understand that not all workloads canmove to the public cloud and there maybe different factors for this therecould be very strict requirements tosupport air gapped or disconnectedoperations there could be compliance andsovereignty requirements for the highestlevels of government workloadsand these workloads may need to operatein limited or no connectivity to theinternet in some casesso for these cases in cases of nationalemergencies and such we actually providethe Google distributed Cloud offeringit's a portfolio of hardware andsoftware Solutions it extends ourinfrastructure to the edge basicallyinto your data centersand the unified gdch platform actuallylets you store your data where youactually need it and it lets you runmodern applications because of our opensource capabilities and ecosystem thatwe incorporate into GDCnow you all know this this is no secretbut Google has always embraced an openCloud strategy so this means that withthe gdch platform it makes it easier forDevelopers for isvs and others toactually build disconnected applicationson top of our platform and we alsoprovide familiar services likeelasticsearch mongodb EnterpriseAdvanced sap all of that on distributedCloud as part of our Marketplace so ithelps you with the expansion strategiesnow we'll look at supervised Cloud it'sour forthcoming product offering and ITaddresses the strongest data andoperational sovereignty requirementsthat we see in countries like France andGermanyand this actually this product bringstogether the scale and power of GoogleCloud's products with the operationalcontrols that our partners bring to thetablenow in this model what happens is Googleprovides the cloud services stack andthis is completely disconnected from therest of gcp and our partners that'slocal third partiesactually sell maintain operate andsupport the clubso now just taking that in what thismeans is that the partner actuallycontrols the physical infrastructurethe partner controls the roots of trustthey control the identity systems theaccess control systems and upgrades tothe softwareso you can think of this as getting samefunctionality as gcp in an isolatedCloud that's operated by partnersand we're partnering with sons in Franceand with T Systems in Germanyand this is to me the strictestrequirements of secnum cloud and Franceand the local BSI requirements inGermanyand we're also building this keeping thefuture in mind right we only see theregulations changing in every part ofthe world so we want to make sure thatas we're building these platforms we'reable to deploy this in other places sofor example the upcoming UCS regulationswhich we think will Land by the end ofthe year or beginning of next year theyhave different levels and for thehighest level of sovereignty needs witheucs this product should be able to meetitnow there's always this question of youknow achieving such high levels ofsovereignty comes with trade-offs that'sexactly what we wanted to avoid so we'vebeen investing very heavily insupervised Cloud to provide customerswith the same Google Cloud experience soif you use gcp supervised Cloud shouldlook and feel exactly the same so sameservice catalog same experience same APIcompatibility so it feels like you'reusing gcp but you're actually using itin an isolated environment justas the The Regulators in France andGermany would want so what this means iswe're taking the core Google cloudservices whether it's local services orGlobal Services and we're deploying theminto universesone for T Systems in Germanyand another one for sons in Franceeach of these universes contain familiarGoogle products that you're used to soit'll have the bigquery the cloudstorage and the compute engine thatyou're used to on a day-to-day basis soit means you're getting the powerfulsoftware that you're always used todelivering the hyperscale capabilitiesthat you expect from Googleand this also makes the developerexperience very easy right so you couldin this world use public Cloud you couldbe using software and controls you couldbe using supervised cloud and you canbring in the right workloads into theright platform and capabilities andbecause the experience is the same youdon't have to retrain any of yourengineers it also means you can use yourexisting terraform scripts and otherscripts that are used for bringing inworkloads so overall from an experiencestandpoint it allows you to actuallyhave a very seamless experience acrossgcp and other Sovereign productsand lastly this is one of ourforthcoming uh products we're working onthis very actively and we are lookingforward to bringing this and making thisavailable to you as soon as possiblenow with that background on differentSovereign products I would like toinvite Supreme the CEO of sans he's beenwith us in this journey of buildingsupervised clouds so let's talk to him alittle bit about his experiences andalso about sovereignty Supreme welcomeawesomeso Brian it's amazing to have you heremaybe you can take a moment to introduceyourselfI'm I'm also very excited to be here andto be discussing this very hot topic ofsovereignty togetheruh so very in a nutshell I have anengineering background studied by careerstrategy Consulting then I worked for acouple of years at meadowmundo which isin uh one of the hottest unicorns inFrance where I built and led theadvanced analytics team and I joinedtennis which is a global leader insecurity and cyber security four yearsago first to work on digitaltransformation topicsand actually I was asked two years agoto explore a knowledge stage opportunityof a partnership with Google Cloud tothe point to offer the French Market theequivalent of gcp but compliant with theFrench regulation and that's what becamesauce today and that's why I became theCEO of songs tooand I know you have an interestingupdate for us from the[Music]onepersonal side I just got my my third kidtwo months ago so yeah the days andnights are pretty busy actuallycongratulations and you know tell us alittle bit more about science and youknow Talus and Google have had a verylong relationship so maybe you couldtell us a little bit about how both thecompanies are related and you know whyscienceyeah indeed you're right therelationship between teles and GoogleCloud goes back a long way I thinkthat's what also facilitate ourpartnershipum so sense specifically is a substituteof Terrace a dedicated subsidiary forthe for this partnership on sovereigntyand he did the question is right why didwe need a dedicated brand and thededicated subsidiary for thispartnership because there are lots andlots of other kind of partnership withinternet and Google CloudI think there are two main reasons uhthe first one is uh that let's basicallysales and builds uh cyber securityproducts and solutions while songs willreally be a cloud service provider asyou said we will maintain and operatethe equivalent of gcp so I need to makeit clear to the market and to repositionsounds as a as a cloud service providerthe second reason is that it's alsoimportant to show the implication ofGoogle in the partnership I think thecustomers want as much The SovereignDimension brought by a kind of localcurrencies brought by teres then to makesure that they get the equivalent of gcpwith the compromise and that's whyhaving a dedicated branding providingThe Best of Both Worlds as you see herewe thought was the best optionEuropean entity which is also importantand essential to adapt to the specificcontextthe company the legal entity was createda year ago we are already 60 and we needto be almost 115 18 monthsand it's been a pleasure working withyou very closely on all of our offeringsSupreme and you know we're talking aboutthe interesting topic of digitalsovereignty and I initially mentioned toeverybody in this room you know if I askeach person what the definition ofsovereignty is it's going to be verydifferent so I'm gonna post thatquestion to you what is digitalsovereignty to you and why is itimportant for the French marketuh so you're right it's a vague term uhif I had to answer I would tell likekind of the most encompassing definitionwhich is all the different possibleoptions for customers to get additionalguarantees and on their data andworkloads uh having said that in Francethere are lots of public contrary hereon sovereignty since it's a vague termuh and I would say we have the thechance they like to to get anotherterminology that we rather use which istrusted Cloud it's been defined by theFrench government in 2021 associatedwith a dedicated certification calledsecond cloud with almost like 300criteria so very kind of rubbishrequirements that ensure that cloudservice solutionprotects is guaranteed againstextrateral accessum and so we rather talk about trustedcloud and I think this explicitdefinition uh is essential because itavoids a lot of debate andlong-lasting debate and discussion withthe customers it also created TheMastermind attraction I think we'll talkabout it later uh and it will be it hasalready unlocked a major obstacle tocollaboration for regulated Industriesand more important for friendsum when friends I think has been at theForefront of discussion and sovereigntyyou know when it comes about regulationwe're pretty good at friendsum so it's been a topic of interest forseveral years already we've had previousinstances for initiatives uh I mean it'snow very hard topic and one example forthat is that our minister of economy isnow minister of economy and Industrialand digital sovereigntyand and absolutely like France hasdefinitely been in the Forefront of allof these regulatory requirements and hasbeen working very clearly on settingthose up so that's actually been veryhelpful not just for us but for the restof the European Union as well so justmoving on a little bit like why did youwhy did you choose to partner withGoogle Cloudum there were several very severalreasons for that first we wanted to getthe best technologyum and especially when it comes to dataand AI uh we need to provide a richcatalog of services to customersum because that's what's lacking on theFrench market todayuh and I think what we've seen just likein the keynote this morning justconfirms of choice and going with Googleshout uh second uh what's also importantis to get a partner that has anambitious strategian sovereignty withsizable Investmentsand the winning list to make it thedifferentiatorumand also a partner that has theflexibility and willingness to kind ofadjust or work together on a newoperating model because of what you justshowed for supervised cloud is that weneed to we're really building together anew operating modeland that's really what we found with thewith Google CloudSerenity is one of one of the keydifferentiators for Isa for you andthat's really key when we see all thetechnical changes that we're facing andthat we're managing uh to have thisflexibility and openness uh and I wouldsay uh last uh we share the sameengineering mindset which means thatover the past three years we've had sometechnical challenges but every time wemanaged to sit around the tableunderstand each other and we've alwaysfound some solutions and that's what Ifind the most amazing in the partnershipthank you and and talking aboutcustomers rightare there certain customers thatactually come to you and talk aboutdigital sovereignty is there a certainsegment sector where you see more of aneed for sovereignty than others so themy shot answer would be it's it it'sless a matter of customers type ofcustomer interested then for eachcustomers which scope will they considersince it's even put in Surprise andsuffering cloudsumin terms of Q Series segments of coursewe think of public sector and that'sright and that we in France they will beforced to use Signum Cloud solutions forthe sensitive data but this goes waybeyond that uh and all the customerswe've talked to in all Industries areinterested in those suffering Solutionsand have some real cases top of mind uhso it's like some Finance customers somecustomers in automotive Aerospace anddefense energy and utilitiestelecommunication health of courseand we even have any friends and notionof uh essential operators defined by theFrench government and they are the mostdemanding on Sovereign Solutionsum so those are I mean mostly major bigcompanies that have that share someconcerns on General political aspects uhand the service companies already thatare already Google Cloud customers andsome that are not which is interestingbut our partnership opened them some newopportunitiesum so I would say what's very the mostimpressive also stack me is that everysingle customer we've talked to uh isinterested and has to use cases top ofmind and then as I said the use casesare different the Scopes are differentand that's what mostly there isand you know this there's this elephantin the room at all times which is isdigital sovereignty actually an enableror an inhibitor for acceleration ofcloud adoption what do you think aboutthatI think that I mean it's clearly been aan inhibitor for the past years becausethere were some solutions uh that gavethe same levels and public clouds I'moffering a public Cloud uh with the withthe software requirements uh so uh Iwould say in France globally almost allthe most sensitive data are still onpremise uh and it's often for goodreasons but we also see sometimes thatthis goes way too faror two extreme decisionsum I know that Finance for example inFrance uh until now has been very latein that cloud adoption compared to othercountriesumand this also creates some long longlasting time consuming internaldiscussions which like clearly slowsdown the cloud adoptionbut we really expect with our friends toaccelerate this to be an accelerator andto enable the regulated Industries tocatch up the pace of the move to cloudof like public Cloud Solutionsuh so we've noticed that in France butmore Global even in Europe you talkedabout UCS in the last month so it'sbecoming a Hot Topic in Europe as awholeand with the last it also includes uhindependent software vendors we see moreand more software vendors that come tous and basically they will have the sameSignum Cloud uh requirements for themtoo and so they come to us and arewilling also to offer their Solutions ina compliant environment got it and youknow let's maybe talk a little bit aboutwhat's actually in the market so whathave we launched today and what cancustomers useso what we've launched uh is what youcall Sovereign controls here which inFrance we call local controls with sensewhich are like in the naming aligns withthe market needs and branding requiredthe offering is available since earlyFebruary in GA and we already have likevery rich catalog of services with notonly infrastructure services but alsolike the major pass services likebigquery spanner big table Etcum as you already mentioned so veryquickly this solution providescontrols on The codita Residencytransparency and the access from anyoperations from Googleand the ability for sense to manage theencryptions key so basically since he'smanaging an external key managerum this enabled customers mostly liketwo different values for customers uhfirst uh it enables them to apply theappropriate set of controls for sometype of data and we often think and thebiggest use case is around like personaldata that are subject to uhregulation like gdpr for example andsecond uh it also enables them to startthe journey towards sovereignty withcells in the perspective of strategyCloud but to start it now and to winsome precious months in their move toCloudand and how are you know customers andthe Murraydo we have customers that are using thiscapability todayyeah so um we've uh as I said theproject has been lived for almost sixmonths we've already been signing a veryfair number of customers uh since therelease you see some of them here thatwe can announce today uh notably severalmajor actors in financeum so you hear it first before we canjointly announce our collaborations butwe have signed with uh Matt mood massivealso who are two major insurancesdifferencewhich is a Consortium of the six majorFrench banks in the finance industryall those customers came to us veryquickly because they were willing tomove to the cloud for the past yearsalready but were blocked and theycouldn't for different security reasonsso I mean as soon as we had the offeringthings went very quickly with them theuse cases cover I would say differentuse cases infrastructure but also datause cases that they couldn't develop inDeploy on premiseor even new application that requirescalability and high performance we'realso seeing a growing interest fromretail and services that are handlinglots of personal data and that wantssome time to apply a higher degree ofprotection for some sensitive personaldata and last we even have some industrycustomers tennis is one of them we havesome other one that are using localcontrols to prepare themselves to thestrategy Cluband supreme just Switching gears alittle bit right like we're makingtremendous amount of investment onsupervised Cloud so can you tell us alittle bit about what science is doingwith supervised cloud and Investmentsyes uh you're right that's massiveInvestments uh from both companies butaligned with like a very ambitious uhvision of the market uh several analystsexpect that between 15 to 30 percent ofthe French cut Market could be asovereign cloudsumso as a very short reminder uhsupervised cloud is where Google isbasically deliver the software softwarestack to songsI will then uh verify maintain andoperate the stack and then of coursesell the solution so in terms ofInvestments this means uh threededicated data centers so we're buildingthe equivalent of a public gcp regionbut dedicated for our service cloud ofcourse a dedicated company with songswith uh almost 200 people to maintainand operate the stackum and also in terms of engineeringwe're working collectively currentlytogether to building a new operatingmodel and those are also tremendousInvestments uh for both companiesAre there specific use cases that you'veheard specifically for supervised cloudfrom customersyeah lots of because as I said as I toldyou before every customers we talk aboutsupervised cloud has some use cases inminduhwhat's really stuck me again is it's notlike Niche or marginal new applicationsuh but Trader critical elements of theirI.T uhso some kind of fake examples of usecases can be connected Vehicles data uhstrategic and financial data digitalbanking digital banking yeah personalHealth Data new insurance offerings sothose are and of course new AI uhofferings so there are some examples ofthe many use cases we've talked aboutwith customers some other customers eventhink of some entire scope of their I.Tmoving to to songs it can be like ErpCRM SRM even some customers areconsidering closing some their own datacenters to move and migrate everythingto to sourceumsecond what's important also is thatthey won't migrate all their data to tosource and as you said uh they'll havedifferent offerings and we're activelyworking on providing like a Continuum ofofferings between public gcp localcontrols and the supervised cloudand most of customers are consideringare considering a Target State when theywhether using those different solutionsum they'll keep using a public gcp forsome non-sensitive use cases and somesupervised code for more sensitive onesfor example and some of them even thinkof hybrid use cases where uh one oneexample a good example is bi for examplebusiness intelligence they want to mixsome non-sensitive data with somesensitive data and so also like we'vebegun working with them and finding somesolutions for them to make the solutionswhile not altering the sensitivity ofthe and the sovereignty of the sensitivedatano I mean that totally makes sense andthere's always the question that comesabout what is unique about this solutionwhy this solution versus other Solutionsand how do you think this is going to beaccepted by the marketuh that's a very good question and Imean we've often uh asked the questionourselves because given the size of theInvestments we want to make sure it's uhI mean it will be like we will have a uhit will be successful uh first uh let meremind very shortly that teles wasinvolved in a an excessive anunsuccessful experience uh five to tenyears ago uhwere the idea was to kind of rebuildfrom scratch uh a French like kind ofsovereign cloud based on open sourcesoftware uh and as I said like I meanthe ICT failed uh I would say mostly fortwo reasons first uh the offering wastechnically too poor compared to publiccloud and customers were not willing toaccept this the Gap and the trade thetrade-off uh and second the match reachof the market was lowered to so now whatreally makes us unique and why I'm veryhighly confident it would be highlysuccessful uh is that we make we aremaking no compromise versus the publicclouds uh we're targeting the samecataract of services not only a subsetbut almost every Service uh same levelof performance and as I said we'll havethe equivalent of a gcp regionum and synchronous updates which meanslike let's say we're in 2025 bigquerywill be available in the supervisedCloud the an update on bigquery will beavailable at the same time on the publiccloud and on supervised cloud and giventhe hybrid use cases that I've talkedabout it's very important for customersso those are the different reasons whatI really think were unique and I'mhighly confident will do well because uhthere are tremendous expectationstremendous Market traction and by theway there is another initiative uhsimilar initiative with Microsoft whichshows the traction and Marketexpectations in Francewe think will be the first on the marketto provide like a rich a drug of servicewith the second Cloud certification andI would say compared to the current uhlocal French players will provide ahigher level of performance a higherresilience and above all all the managedservices for within gcp yeah and justeven thinking about the Frenchyou know situation the regulations andeverything else we talked about how alot of this is driven by regulations andyou know we've been working very closelywith ANSI on the Signum Cloudregulations and the needs for a productof the sort could you talk a little bitabout how that has been the experienceas well as what we've been doingthroughout this processyes we've worked with NC uh from thevery beginning from day one because wewanted to make sure that thearchitecture we put in place will becompliant so it's already been a verylong journey more than two years nowum and we built on the very goodrelationship between uh that is theexisting relationship between telescenceof courseum we're continuing to discuss with uhwith NC uh we're validating almost everysingle decision we're making to ensurewe get the certification in the endand I think this is a win-wincollaboration of course we need and seeas I said to ensure the compliance ofour model uh but I also think that NC isalso very interested in a sense I meanthey've definedum uha new certification that's pretty likedemandingand they want the most offerings to getthe certification and our promise todeliver the equivalent of the GoogleCloud platform offering with thecertification uh is like expected by thewhole market and I think that's why alsowant to see it really helping us on thisand thank you so much for all of thisinformation ciprian this has been reallyhelpful and I'm sure everybody agreeswith me could you you know for folksthat are just starting out on theirsovereignty Journeyum do you have any comments before youwrap up on what they could be doing inorder to make this journey a little bitsmoother for themanyways pleasureum I would say um first you shouldremember that this is a very longjourney so you should start now uh don'twait that the solutions are availablethere are lots of things to anticipatethere are some strategic decision tomake that are encompassing like someFinancial uh aspect some Investmentssome resources expect some technicaldecisions to make so this should beanticipated and you should start nowfirst it's also a topic that has to beaddressed at the highest level of thecompany is given the Strategic decisionsto make secondas we've discussed over the like thewhole uh session there's noone-size-fits-all solutionso uh taking back your example on theshoes and the jewelry you should startif that's not already the case byidentifying the different uh type ofdata and sensitivity you have andfinding the appropriate solutions foreach and think of a Target model whichwill be a hybrid model with differentsolutionsuh can I would say last don't forget theresource Dimension uh internal resourceswill need to be upskilled to be trainedthem this data if this takes time sorryuh and that's it to anticipate it nowthank you so much for joining us todayciprian it's been a pleasure having youherethank youall right folks Sabrina actually made myjob very easy because I was gonna do awrap up and give you some resources andthings to actually think about but hewas spot on he actually gave us the keythings for you to think about in thisjourneythe first part is obviously classifyingyour workloads as we've all repeatedover and over again same solution is notgoing to fit all of your needs so one ofthe first things to do as anorganization is think about thedifferent workloads that you're planningto sort of bringinto this Sovereign environment thesecond is being strategic right thinkingthrough which countries do you plan toexpand your business to over the nextfive years so these countries ordetermination of these countriesactually helps you in thinking about theregulations that actually apply in eachof these countriesand then lastly comes the process ofactually picking the solutions and wehope that we can make that process alittle bit easier for you because we'rethinking along the same lines ofthinking about the actual workloads theexpansion into different countries andthe regulations and we're closely payingattention to regulations in differentparts of the world to bring you the bestsolutions for your needs right and tomake this a little bit more easier wealso have additional sovereigntyExplorerum I promise this QR code is safe youcan click on it it actually takes you tothe Explorerum and this actually makes this journeya little bit easier for you so you canmap out exactly the kind of product thatyou might need to take inas part of your journey for additionalsovereignty"
