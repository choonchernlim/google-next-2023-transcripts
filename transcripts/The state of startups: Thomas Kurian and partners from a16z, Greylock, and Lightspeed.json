so very very delightedto have all of you herethis is a very very timely topic as uhwe're arguably going through one of thethe most significant Evolutions liketechnology that gen AI is certainlychanging the way business is being donetoday how we interact with our customerswith data you know things that were notpossible in the future and now with thewith the advance of gen AI have nowbecome possible and we continue to seehow companies are Reinventing how thingsare done and of course startups is a asa category or a very keyum you know stakeholder in all of thismany of you in the audience today areleading the charge when it comes todriving Innovation you know changing howthings are being done and to discuss thethis topic today I'm very very excitedto welcome our four panelists Thomascarrion who is the CEO of Google Clouduh Ravi Matra who is the foundingpartner of Life speed uh VenturePartners Sarah Wang who's a generalpartner of Andreessen Horowitz and ashimchattna who is the partner of GreylockPartners so uh welcome panelists andthank you for being here so withoutfurther Ado uhso without further Ado I wanted to jumpright in because we've got a lot of uhcontent to cover so maybe I'll startwith you Thomasum you you talk to a lot of differentcompanies large and small right youprobably meet with some of the mostpromising startups in the world can youmaybe just share with us some of theTechnologies or emerging trends thatyou're witnessingyou know we're seeing enormous interestfrom the startup ecosystem whether thatis people working to build products thatare consumer facing or people buildingproducts that are Enterprise facing inusing AI to redefine the category ofproduct they're in because if you're notdoing it somebody else iswe as Google want to help the startupecosystem today 70 of all AI unicornsrun on gcp and 50 of all ai-fundedstartups run on gcp and so we're whatwe're doing is taking every piece of thetechnology that we have you can start byjust saying I need accelerators becauseI'm building my own modelsor you can say no I really want to builda product I don't want to build afoundational model I want to start withyour models and so we give you aplatform to use our models or you caneven build on top of the integratedexperience we have called Duet and thereare lots of companies doing that thismorning we talked about how workday isdoing that for example and there aremany many other companies doing itrecognizing our startups we give youaccess to our technical people so thatthey can answer questions and show youhow to optimize the use of our models orof our platform we provide you go tomarket help so that you can as you buildyour product we can help you in themarket and we really think it's aprofound shift that's happening in theway that software products are beingdesigned and builtthank you ThomasRobbie maybe I'll just continue thatquestion with you Lightspeed is a VCthat's known for like to say seeingaround the corners we've been able toidentify a lot of early Trends andrecently I know you've also been youknow uhinvesting a lot in the Gaming'sverticals so maybe you can also sharewith us kind of what you're seeing themarket now in the startups communityyeahum I would uhEcho what Thomas said I think uh Ai andyou know if you really I'm sure all ofyou in the audience see it um it has aprofound ability todisrupt the product experience in almostall technology categoriesum and if you're not thinking about howto use AI to meaningfully evolve what aproduct experience is your competitorsor someone some other right person is sothat's an enormous opportunity forstartups and uh it's an enormous placewhere existing companies do need to seearound corners and one interesting thingyou know that we've noticed across Ithink at this point Lightspeed probablyhas invested in maybe 30 or 40 companiesrecently in AI that are really focusedon generative AI as the place that theywant to disrupt but that the if we thinkabout it as the cost structure of astartup company where if you werehistorically a software company even ifyou were assassin running in the cloudyou would think about the money that youraise what you needed to spend at least70 percent was on people highly skilledsoftware developers product managers Etcand there was a back end of the the costyou need to stay and on your on yourcloud back end to run your software bothin test Dev mode and then to deliver theexperience to the customers what we'veseen with our AI companies consistentlyit's a it is a material shift because ofthe need toum whether it's training on the data orinferencing from data whatever place youland in the stack you need to thinkabout the cost structure of your companyprobably being at least 50 percent up to70 percent compute data networkingstorage and then that residual balanceis a smaller set of exceptionallywell-trained and highly educated peoplewho know how to build the capabilityyou're trying to offer and the reasonthat's important I think one I thinkGoogle is probably established itself ifif that is going to be ultimately thecost structure of the business that youbuild you want a partner who has youknow extreme expertise at scale and youknow the cost effective ability mostcost effective ability to delivercompute and I think I think that's aplace where I think the world is goingto sort of ultimately see that Google isgoing to have a real distinctiveAdvantage so you know that is one thingthat we we think about a lot that thisjust structure of startup companies aregoing to look different and you're goingto have to think about really being akind of compute Factory and whatever itis the product that you deliver if ifit's an AI product sothank you Robbie you talked about coststructure right so it's actually a nicesegue into your question I have for youSarah which is uh you you recentlyco-authored an article about theeconomics of gen Ai and various languagemodels and in your article which is afascinating read you talked about thefact that hey this generation of gen AIis a little bit different from what wesaw as AI in the past right and it's nowarrived in a sense where it'ssustainable it's cost effective maybeyou can just talk a little bit aboutkind of your view on thatno absolutely and I think even just toFirst acknowledge I think the premiseimplicit in your question is that AI hasbeen around for for decadesum and you know I know a16z certainly isinvested in it for over a decade and umyou know I think we do believe that it'svery very different this time around anda big part of that does Center on theeconomicsum but you know I think before we getinto why that looks different this timearoundum I think actually the easiest way tosummarize the difference isthat the impact of AI in this timearound in nine short months has actuallybeen broader than it has been in thelast 20 yearsum the models that we're using today arenot just helping us play go at asupernatural level or slightly betterpredict our propensity to click on abanner ad no offense Google that's greatbusinessum but but really insteadcreating changing new user behaviors andthat's across art design games medicinecoding even the very core of HumanRelationships and how you think aboutinteracting withpeople or you know AI I should say isreally changing and we think it's thisthis broad nature of that impact thatcreates a really fertile ground forstartupsum and I think that broad nature of thatimpactsegues nicely into the economic valueright and um you know I think we talkabout the microchip bringing themarginal cost of compute to zero theinternet bringing the marginal cost ofdistribution to zero and if you thinkabout the businesses that respond fromthose two Dynamics we get very veryexcited about generative AI bringing themarginal cost of creation of zero and sowith this wave of AI we have seen a lotof more creative use cases taking offand sort of inherent in the wordgenerative in the first place but theseare use cases where correctness may notbeas important right they're not it's notself-driving cars where you really needto get that nth degree of correctness uhwhich is very very costly and sort ofsupports the incumbents exceeding andEndeavors such as that but it's reallyareas where creativity is King andum the reason that ties to economicvalue is that creativity is actuallyoften tied to white-collar roles wherethe cost of the human is very expensiveright and we you know in our articlethat James referenced we talk about acouple of examplesum a basic one would be generatingimages right that costs thousandth of adollar and a second with AI to generateand if you take a look at I hope there'sno graphic designers in the room but youknow having a graphic designer create animage in an hour and you know cost youat least a hundred dollars right that'sa hundred thousand X difference in thecost of creation and so if you thinkabout what that means for startups rightthat's that'sthat is your opportunity and that Deltais very different this timeum and then the third thing I just sayis uh it's not just Theory um what'sreally exciting about this wave is thatthere's actually proof in the puddingright uh speed to adoption and thenwillingness to pay also has looked verydifferent at least I'm sure you know forthe the VCS on this panel all of us haveseen companies get to an astoundingnumber of users you guys may have seenyou know on Twitter sort of that time toget to a million users right with withNetflix that was three and a half yearswith Facebook it dropped down to 10months chat gbt five days and you knowsince then I think a lot of startupshave actually broken chat gbt's recordandthat pairing I think just makes this areally exciting time to be a startupfounderthank you thank you Sarahumone of your colleagues at Greylockrecently coined this phrase AI or diewhich is a little a little dramatic butthere's a lot of truth truth behind it Itake it to mean that it doesn't matterwho you are where you are large or smallif you don't have the AI strategyspecifically a gen AI strategy you'renot going to survive in this new worldSo to that point maybe you can you cantalk a little bit about you know whichIndustriesdo you see or use cases are being mostdisruptive or being most disrupted ortransformed in this age of AIyeah no thanks I would say I mean justfundamentally just to Echo what you knowhas already been said and to add to thatI would say that uh I mean fundamentallywhat AI you know I think the promisesthat can improve productivity right andimprove productivity for white collarworkers blue collar workers and I thinkthe you know the impact of this is goingto be across Industries uh just take acouple of examples so Healthcare is avery large part of you know the USeconomy and of you know of just aworldwide GDP and you take somethinglike healthcare and you look at whatmight lie ahead right I mean AI can goacross the life cycle right all the wayfrom drug Discovery to you know clinicaldiagnosis to ongoing care you know toWellnessum you know or take another industrywhich you know um you know you know manyfolks here can probably relate moreclosely to is just technology and justtake software right uh it's uh you knowI think if you sit in this room 10 yearsfrom now you know the way computerscience has taught will likely be youknow quite different from the way it'sbeing taught today and under allcomputers play you know in in the waysoftware is driven uh you know it'sgoing to be completely different andwell you know and so in terms of what itdoes what is what does it really mean tobe a software engineer you know five orten years from now and you know it'svery likely you know the role ofsoftware engineer is going to change uhand uh you know people can be much moreproductive productive right not just inwriting software but in softwaredocumentation you know other thingsaround software uh maybe just to talklike you know functionally for a coupleof moments right for most businessessales and marketing is a significantpart of you know of uh you know ofoperating cost and you know for mostcompanies as they grow uh you know oneof the key ways the business getsoperating Leverage is they actually youknow become more efficient in sales andmarketing and so if you look at likesomething like Ai and the promise itholds right just across sales andmarketing uh you know all the way fromyou know lead generation the way leadgeneration is done if you look at theway you know customers are curated youlook at SEO then it's done today the wayit may be done in the future look atthings like you know a b testing thinklook at proactive Outreachuh and maybe just take one lastfunctional piece you know take customersupport or customer operations right andyou and again look at you know look atthe amount of money a business spends onthat today across Industriesand if you look at what may lie aheadand again how AI may be able to helpright both customer agents to become bemore effective and also in many casesyou know the AI itself right could be alevel one level two agent so I think Ithink what lies ahead I mean we're veryvery early in this journey and you knowwhat really lies ahead is taking thistechnology and then bringing it to avariety of use cases and in many casesyou know just driving productivityhigher and in other cases you knowthings are going to be possible thatwere not possible you know beforeexcellentso we talked a little bit about kind ofthe the macro Trend and opportunitiesright I want to kind of bring it down alot with you maybe something more microbecause I know many many of ouraudiences today here are startupFounders uh and you're probablywondering hey like how how do Icapitalize on this wave of gen AI rightso Thomas I wanted to come back to youand you know if I'm a if I'm a startupfounder today and I have all these likeAI tools you know models maybe I'mbuilding my own model or maybe I'mbuilding on top of the model with usecases how do I think about leveragingall these for my businessyou know having worked with a number ofstartups I think we suggest thinkingabout three dimensions one what's theproduct you want to build two how do youwant to build it third how do you takeit to Marketso what's the product you want to buildyou know today we showed how AI Powersall of our products in Cloud literallywe have woven AI into every singleproduct to redefine the experience wehave with it and the way that we talkabout it internally istoday when you think about if you thinkabout the complexity of the internet andwhat Google does all of you use Googleand you go and type search behind thescenes we've taken all the complexitythe internet and simplified it so thatyou can type into a search box you don'thave to enter IP addresses and hostnames and routing informationsame thing what we've done with ourproducts is taking the sophistication ofa language modeland then put it behind an interface sowe showed you you could chat with it andsay create an image and a slide deckand we're always looking Beyond where weare now to watch the eventual answer aperson wants so when we saidin when you look at analytics we're notjust translating English into SQLbut we're actually doing the analysisand we're saying not just what happenedbut why it happenedand when we showed that you couldactually create a slight deck out of itwe're narrating exactly what happenedand why it happened so that you don'thave to do all that work so the firstthing I would say is think about if youhad a domain in which you're building aproduct how do you think aboutredefining what that domain would be ifyou had AI capability that reallyunderstood the domain that's number onenumber two as Ravi saidyou know you need to change the way youthink about how you build products atGoogle for example we're using our modelour coding model to do all tasks andwhen we say all tasksgenerating codegenerating documentationsupervising check-ins so at Google youcan't just check in code you have tohave a peer review of the code often thepeer review are the experts and there'sonly so many of them around so peoplecomplain that they're waiting on theexpert to check in their code so we'retraining the model to actually superviseand find issues like whether there'ssecurity defects Etcwe're also working on something wherethere will never be a legacy codeanymoremeaning if a model can understand yourcode it can always migrate the code andso you never have a legacy system and sothe key is looking at what is the IPthat you want to own with humans andwhere can you use a system to hugelyimprove the productivity and Pace withwhich you build products that's numbertwonumber three you know how do you runyour company and where do you focus onthe you know the value of AI changingthe cost structure of your companywe've seen people use it in everyfunctionyou know Finance to track for examplewhich companies are going to pay youversus not accounts payableHR how do you most Engineers say heydon't want to waste time writing a jobpost can you have a generated job postfor youhow can you help you know train yourMarketing sales and most importantly wehave a huge number of people using itfor customer service and these systemscan be spun up super quickly when I saysuper quickly just to give an exampleorange which is a telecommunicationscompany in France set up a customerservice system two Engineers four daysin the first week it was answering 10000 questions a daywith 98 accuracyWhich is far more imagine hiring thenumber of people an average person evenif they did six calls a day uh six callsin an hour that's if you multiply themath that's an astonishing large numberof peopleand so we think think about what productyou want to build how do you want tobuild it how do you want to take it toMarket and where do you adjust the coststructure for your company so that youcan spend more money perfecting the AIwhich will be the basis of your productwhile shifting other costs to make spacefor itI wanted to maybe come to you nextbecauseum I think one of the things you talkedabout is a nice build up from whatThomas talked about is kind of buildingthis defensible mode right so Thomastalked about how you leverage businessmodel technology Etc you really builtthe business right I know we're still inthe early Innings of the the Gen AIcompetition like can you maybe talk alittle bit about like what what does ittake to to be ahead and stay aheadyeah I'll uh answer that question maybein two ways with the caveat that youmentioned uh that the space is stillvery early moats are evolving and andalso really depends on what what type ofbusiness You're Buildingum but the the first way I'll answer itis actually maybe through theanti-thesis um which is what is not amoat of the companies that we've seenum and how have those even started toplay out even though the space is veryearlythe first one is thin wrappers builtaround gpt4 or whichever model you'vechosen those companies often get earlysuccess maybe some first mover Advantagebut the ease of which AI is makingsoftware development means that yourcompetitors are coming much much fasteras well and the differentiation is justincredibly low and when I say thin Imean you're really a spot solution maybeone way of making copy editing a littlebit easier not to pick on any particularcompanies but that's an area where we'veseen a flood of companies look almostidentical to each other and when youdon't own the model you don't own toomuch of the workflow after someoneyou've gotten the customer in that justhas tended to be a bloodbath from acompetitive standpointum the second piece and I say thisactually because it's a good thing Ithink for startups is that a lot oftraditional moats are also eroding sopeople always talk about system ofrecord Being the most venerated businessmodel right high gross retention youthink about your sales forces your workdays your servicenows but the datagravity that comes with beingthat type of business is also no longerremote even you know the snowflakes ofthe world right with AI you can actuallymove data back and forth quite easilyand so I think that does create newopportunity for startups to come in sothat's probably a segue actually to whatwe have seen as signs of early moats andso I'll talk about maybe two types ofbusiness models again very different thefirst one is the vertically integratedfull stack app so that's where you buildthe build your own model you own the appso from Soup To Nuts you're owning thefull stackumthis is not a business model foreveryone so I'll put that out there thatbeing said the reason that we like itand it's one of the reasons I investedin a company named character.ai is itdoes give you this level of control frombuilding the model to collecting thedata and then being able to create thatfeedback loop where you're actuallyusing your data to make your modelbetter and your product betterum and you know I think a little storythat uh openai once shared when I thinkthis was back in December before chatGPT had come out they mentioned that youknow they they wanted to use it to youknow it was sort of uh hey let's let'sget human feedback right um we wantpeople using this it was sort ofaccidental that it actually exploded inthe way it didum and you know I think just thatanecdote in and of itself shows thepower at which hey this data is rare andhow can we get it to actually make ourunderlying model better that doesn'tmean I think everyone in the room shouldgo out and build their their own model Ido think it sort of depends on the teamthat you have uh and thenum you know there's been a lot of talkabout cost structure and why that'simportant but uh I also this is a casewhere um in my almost 15 years ofinvesting I think partnership with thefolks at gcp has never been actuallymore importantum and I was not paid to say that but uhyou know it's this is an area wherethere's tremendous you know capacityneeds and there's a lot of demand and somaking sure you you can actually buildthe model that you're trying to is uh isa competitive Advantage it's not emotein and of itself but it feeds into themoat that you build with a full stackapp the second type of business modelactually maybe I'll take a quick pollhow many uh in this room are foundersokay and how many of you guysfounded your businesses before 2023.okay great so so most of you um so thisis actually maybe even more targeted atyou guysum but I think where we get reallyexcited is when companies who arebuilding AI products actually do own thefull workflow and this is not by anymeans a new playbook right if you thinkabout a company like figma and what theydid to product design I remember callingtheir customers when we when we investin figma back in in 2020 and hearingthem sayI ripped out 10 pieces of software all Ineed is figma right and so what wereally get excited about and you know Ithink Thomas alluded to this in terms ofgetting into the domain and seeing howyou can reimagine how that domain is isreally created top down but are youreimagining the workflow for datascience for software developmentwhatever domain you've decided to founda company in are you really Mattreimagining that workflow because ifyou're just tagging on a light AIwrapper on your product I think thatgoes back to the anti-thesis of heyyou're just a light wrap around gpt4 oryou know whatever model you've pickedthat gets less defensibleif you're owning the entire workflow theway figma did right and changed forproduct design but using AI this iswhere it gets very very exciting and Iactually think there's a lot ofcompanies that are modern right thecompanies that many of you in the roomhave founded and are very wellpositioned to found these types ofcompanies because you'll probablyalready own a lot of that workflow rightyou've built a company Through BloodSweat and Tears and now you know there'sthis disruption but how do you harnessthat disruption and match it with youradvantage of owning the workflowwhatever distribution Advantage you'vebuilt and really create something fromyou know sort of re uh birth of TheRebirth of your company um we've seenthat with a with a bunch in our ownportfolio and I think there's a lot ofopportunity theregreat thank you thank you Sarah so we wetalked to we Thomas talked about thetechnology and tools to build thebusiness right Sarah talked about likehow to build a defensive defensive modeand strategy to be uh differentiated andyou know as Founders I'm sure you care alot about Capital right getting the thefunding to keep your business going andso a question that I have for you ashimis um obviously great looks at a ton ofcompanies right what what separates theones that you invest in is it is it thethe founding team is it particularbusiness model like what do you look forwhen you when you're investing yeah soum my starting part would probably beI've been at Great Rock now for 20 yearsyours has gone by fast the last yearfeels like it's AI by the minute rightso uh but I would say if there's onething I would say I would say you know Ifundamentally believe in the peoplebusiness uh and you know if I just lookover the years right extraordinarypeople have made extraordinary thingshappen generally the best teams winwhich sounds very simplistic to say thatbut so that'd be one point but thenmaybe just just you know going a littlebit more into AI specifically right it'sa very interesting moment in time rightjust given the the the activity leveland number of new things that are goingon uh you know we think of the space inthree at three levels so we think of thefoundation layer then we think of themiddle layer uh AI infrastructureenabling infrastructure and on the topwe think of applications right AIenabled applications and you know Ithink if we sit here 10 years from now alot of money is going to be made in allthese layers a lot of money is going tobe lost in all these layers as wellright and I would say you know justbeing on the VC side it is very hardright because uh you know I mean we meetyou know many companies every day and uhit's it's very hard to discern so whatdo we look for I think you know numberone you look for people the other pieceis I would say we're doing you knowthings at the foundational level byextreme exception we are in Adept andinflection we feel very fortunate to bein both those businesses uh I think onAI enabling infrastructure it's alsochallenging right because I think asTime Marches by once you should expectyou know if you take Google Cloud youknow it's gonna it should you know it'salready world class and amazing right interms of AI enabling infrastructure butlike by the hour it's going to be betterright so if you think of these companiesthat are out there you know what istheir Edge yet but I think yet therewill be some businesses that will growand you know will uh you know will uhexecute well and then I think on AIenabled apps right it comes down to youknow you know what's your real Advantagethere right and I think what many peoplebelieve is if you have a data advantageor if you have a workflow Advantageright those are things that maybe youcan have some durability I think one ofthe challenges there also is that thereare large incumbent vendors and todaymany of the incumbents are moving muchfaster than in the past right but Istill I I do believe like just in on theon the app side you know I think there'sa lot of opportunity to take workflowscustomer workflows understand thoseworkflows better than anybody else andthen over time you know build some uhyou know build you know build somedurability uh you know you know with adata Advantage so um yeah they willpause there very very valid pointsashamed that it feels like now now weknow the secret sauce you're gettinginvestment from GreylockI uh Ravi I reserve a particularlycontentious question for you because Iknow you're up to the task uh you knowwe we've talked a lot about the promisesof of AI and great startups Etc rightthere's a there's another group of ofpeople who are saying that this is justa big bubble right the valuations arecrazy right you got unicorns beingcreated every month right this thing isnot sustainable it's all going toexplode a spectacular fashionlove to get your thoughts right like isthis is this a bubble or somethingthanks for that questionI think to be fair I mean and Thomasactually all of us probably the gardenercoined the that the Enterprise sort ofadoption cycle of Technologies and youknow there's sort of a period of hypeand optimism before anyone actually hasto really make it work in the real worldand then you the next thing is calledthe trophic disillusionment and you knowlike I think I started in the investmentbusiness and technology and um what wasit uh yeah in 1994 so it's been a whilebut I mean I'm amazed that that kind ofpattern it plays out almost every timebecause I do think and AI you know at afundamental level I think it will rivalthe you know the sort of seminal pointwhere the internet became something thatwas used you know globally in in a waythat it wasn't just sort of a governmentdefense kind of infrastructure it'llrival what happened with you know mobileand the cloud I mean it is as profoundas that but with that you know the humanmind and the ability to imagine all theways in which ultimately this is goingto manifest that happens instantly andthen you know investors in capital flowsso we're certainly in a moment in timewhere I think you know as it seems thata lot of money will be made ultimatelybut a lot of money will ultimately belost and some of the money that's goingto be lost is a function of money that'sbeen put into the market in the past sixto eight months so I think you know whatwe'll see from here is it we've seen italready actually it's a bit of aSlowdown in the in the kind of justaspirational hopeful large amounts ofcapital in startups with the promise ofsomething in the future and now we'regoing to get to a period where you knowfor more money to flow into companiesyou really have to start seeing whereyou know I think it's both Sarah andHashim said you know this idea of a newworkflow uh you know of kind of traineddata something that's pretty special andunique about how you would take Ai andput it into a practical thing that aconsumer or a business operator is goingto use in a way where they just get alot better at whatever was they weredoing and it could be workflow it couldbe that there's unique Data Insights butwe're gonna only we're gonna start tosee capital in this sort of trough ofdisillusionment is going to be like heyall this money went into the promisewhat things are really working what arenew products that are fundamentallybetter and we'll we'll sort of hit thatperiod And I thinkit's the normal part of how Technologiesget absorbed into the market and then atsome point as we start to see thecompanies that are building realbusinesses come out on the other side Ithink I think the market will normalizeand from there I do think that it's justthey're going to be an enormous numberof opportunities to build real companieswith real products that are just they'refundamentally they allow differentthings to happen than the ways in whichpeople use technology todayum you know another point I would make Iguess just not to make people fearfulthat we're sort of riding at this kindof peak point and all of a sudden we'regoing to go like this you know I willsay that um we've been surprised withthe ability ofin teams whether it's thinking veryconcretely about a PRD that it says heyif the workflow could include generativeAI I mean in in creativity forbusinesses around you know whether it'simages or videos or or text copy a wayto be really concrete about here's sortof a new workflow versus how theworkflow exists today and we're going tocreate some very functional way to usethe generative aspect of AI to make theworkflow better we've seen that as a waythat the products get really tangiblereally quicklyum and I think it's been justinteresting to us the other piece thatagain I was I'm not sure if it wasmentioned but where very you know liketangible ways that AI can kind ofmanifest as a productyou know we're really we think that thekind of foundation models that will becompanies like Google if if you can bein a position to leverage because thistakes an enormous amount of money tokeep retraining and compute it's reallytough for a startup to be in a businesswhere you've got to be in that part ofthe stack however you know the abilityto train on the edge and and inEnterprise the ability to the systems ofrecord the you know oracle appsobviously were there the FCPS they'renot going away those are the drivechains of the business it's tooexpensive to rip them out so companiesthat want to use generate a generativeAI in an Enterprise context they lookfor really clever ways to take you knowit's maybe the foundation model thatGoogle or someone else has developed andthen they integrate to these systems ofrecord and they take data exhaust fromthem and to solve some you know problemmaybe maybe it's you know we're in acompany called Navan actually with withuh Andreessen Horowitz it's um they havean AI enabled way that you businessemployees can book their business travelbut you basically take data from youknow travel reservation systems and youuse it to enrich an underlying you knowFoundation model and all of a suddenyou've got a product where you've got anautomated travel agent and that is sortof a white collar job that you canautomate with AI without building yourown Foundation model and it's so sosomething to think about is hey you knowmaybe I don't have to be the world'sbest at you know just kind of generativeAI model training but how can I takesome data that may exist in theEnterprise let me integrate to somesystems and then let me solve a problemthat I can imagine you know generativeAI can solve with this sort of specialdata that I used in you know that Itrain with that makes the bottle justreally smart at one specific task inaddition to the sort of General smartsit gets from a foundation model andthat's been a I just see a recurrentpattern in some of the products thatseem like they're getting substantialTraction in the market now you knowbefore we hit this this trough ofdisillusionment and come out the otherside so I think word zerothank you"
