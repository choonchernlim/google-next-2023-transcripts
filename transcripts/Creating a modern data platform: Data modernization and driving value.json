interactive Iappreciate you being here and I'm reallyexcited to talk about what it takes tocreate a modern data platformmy name is Danielle Behringer that'sreally awkward with a huge picture upthere so I'm just going to go to thenext slide I am a managing director atKPMG in our data management andEngineering practiceprior to KPMG I was the chief dataofficer at a major Automotive for sixyears that's like dog years that's areally long time to be a chief dataofficer but my background is as a dataengineer and software engineer acrossindustry and really all that means isI'm a huge data nerd and I'm reallypassionate about how the market ischanging and the ways that we canreshape our future for people who wantto do more with dataI want to start with a definition ofdata modernization this is a definitionthat I believe is a huge change in howwe think about the way we use data forValue it's a strategic approach forInnovative use accessibility governanceoperations and doing more in a modernCloud architecture through peopletechnology and process transformationfirst things first by show of hands howmany of you are ready today for somedata therapyyeah I know it hurts unfortunately a lotof people aren't even self-aware thatthey need it so what I wanted to startwith because no presentation at thisconference would be complete withoutsaying the words generated AII want to start with what are the whatare the prerequisitesif we don't create a modern dataecosystem and go back to some of thebasics of the unsexy topics like dataqualitydata governance oh I know it's not agreat term but it really matters so thisjourney that I'm showing here Horizonone two and three is about starting withsome self-reflection which is why I callit data therapy how do you assess yourenvironment your portfolio the datamaturity of the folks that are workingevery day with data potentially inspreadsheets and they have no idea thatthere's a better way you're trying tobuild Cloud infrastructure deployapplication workloads and modernize yourdata warehouses and data Lakes butwithout doing it in Partnership betweenthe business and I.T it often failsmiserablyso if we return to some of the the heartof the matter as we prepare to dogenerative Ai and to get more businessvalue out of our data I want you tothink of this as a prerequisite thetopic of data modernizationchallenges everyone's got them I workfor a Professional Services firm ifpeople didn't have challenges we wouldhave some problems right so if we lookat the top challenges we're seeing inmany cases it's technology proliferationand the challenges for datamodernization are never about thetechnology at least not most of the timethey're about the people and the processthey're about the adoption I like to saythat the presence of Technology does notequal success but adoption does and ithas to be sustainable so when we look atthings like organizational resistancedata verification incorrect integrationsome people call this like theintegration hairball it's a real thingrighthow do we move past that how do we startto take people on the journey with us aswe're modernizing as they're maybe goingthrough a really long painful Erpmodernization or a financetransformation how do we find thoseopportunities with data to give themsomething satiating while they'rewaiting for a really long road map thattakes a lot of time and is very complexso there are six things here that we seeas success criteria when we work withour clientswhen we see them changing theirorganizations creating a data culturecreating data literacy but mostimportantly having some very hardpainful conversations about dataminimization and Technologysimplificationwe do not see organizations who haveGreenfield nothing they have a lot theyhave business intelligence tools visualanalytics tools data wrangling toolsdata science tools open source multiplecloudsand a lack of integration consistencyand certainly a lack of operationallysound sustained data ecosystemsso though I'm mentioning just in shortform business vision for data valueright do the business stakeholdersbelievethat the data ecosystem can supporttheir vision for what they want toaccomplish in the business whether it'sa sales and marketing division thatwants to do more and maybe insource somethings that they've given to agenciesand partners maybe it's a supply chainteam that has zero visibility to data intheir manufacturing plan or anythingthat's actually Ingress and egress outof that plant to be successful withsupply chaina modern layered architecture can beextremely intimidating to people thatare not in the immediate perimeter ofI.T so how do we show it to them in away show them a portfolio that is basedon business value not just technologicaldefinition or a bill of materials of 52cloud services that they have toassemble in order to make a widget rightdata governance and literacy of courseis extremely important I actually thinkdata quality and data governance arehaving a Renaissance because when peoplewent through gdpr and CCPA and theyrealized that 72 copies of theircustomer database lived around thecompany and Joe every Thursday wassending the customer database in anExcel spreadsheet to a group of peoplethey were horrified but what it did wasit uncovered an opportunity to spendmore time on metadata management andmore time on a data catalog definitionsa data dictionary and certainly somedata minimizationso now here we are we want to pursuegenerative AI everyone is supercomfortable with everything prompted theexpectation for clients is absolutelychanging they expect it to be easierthey expect to use natural language toaccomplish a task that previously beforerequired a lot of different steps indata wrangling so Envision in a moderndata architecture some of the thingsthat are on the right but fundamentallychanging how people work I like to sayif they were spending 30 hours a weekdata wrangling and cobbling thingstogether what would it do if that becametwo hoursa lot of people worry that they wouldlose their job they would be repurposedI like to think that they get 28 hoursback to work on things they wouldn'thave gotten to for two yearsthey are pulling ahead all of thosevaluable activities all thatvalue-driven consumption of data becauseof optimization of the environment adeeper understanding of the dataand an infrastructure and services thatmake it easy and self-service for thembut also protect privacy and risk andsecuritypart of the data therapy againself-awareness exercise it goes fromleft to right the Baseline activities onthe left I am absolutely certain most ofyou have this in place today in yourorganizations traditional dataarchitecture logical and physical datamodelingyou know standards reference data theseare the table Stakesto be doing data and analytics nowhow many of you have ever played SuperMario Brothers or have children orfamily that okay good yay okay this isjust like Super Mario Brothers you don'tget to go to level five all the way onthe right until you pass through thelevels priorit's very important so most people findthemselves somewhere in the middle theyhave visual analytics tools they maybehave a manually derived data catalogthey are starting to build a racywhether it they have a cloud center ofexcellence and maybe a data center ofexcellence maybe they have a hybridmodel where itis is providing certaindata services data engineering datascience is normally Federated and isfound in the lines of business andeveryone is starting to work togetherbut to get to the items on the rightreally takes a complete transformationin the way that people are workingtogether their understanding of data asa product and I'll talk a little bitabout that todayand then also taking full advantage ofthe cloud native Technologies youshouldn't really be building anythingthat you can do with the amazingchanging environment of the providerscertainly Google and others that havecapability that you can use and you needto really focus on making itprescriptive for your industry for yourdomain and then you can really lean intoData product life cycle datamonetizationprivacy engineering and consideringinteresting ways to you gen usegenerative AI like synthetic datageneration right those things require afoundation in the things that are on theleftso this is the first part this is theassessment on the bottom I've given justsome very simple examples inorganizations we've encountered wherethey have push and pull between a chieftechnology officer a chief data officerEtc I was fortunate to have Enterprisearchitecture and Cloud at the same timethat I was doing my role as a dataofficer and so in looking at that spanit all came down to the people businessstakeholders pilots who were willing togo first into the cloud environment whoare willing to go first into doing datascience and data explorationhaving a way in a venue for them to dothat in a physical environment in acloud environment and starting to changesome of the philosophy about it or howan organization would make dataaccessible to peoplenow the way that that can be done isit's often difficult if you have an itisorganization that is driving everythingaround technology and never connectingit to business valuethe business stakeholders say wellwhat's in it for me you're replacing myErp system you're making me new use newtools but I'm still stuck with the samedata that I'm wrangling in aninefficient way so we start theconversation now and say this is anexample of 10 business value leaversI would Advocate that every single dataprogram and project or product that youpursue you pick a primary business valuelever and a secondary one and youdirectly tie it to and have aconversation with business stakeholdersand say will you be a pilot I believe wecan help you support RegulatoryCompliance I believe we can help youhave faster speed to Market can wepartner up together and do thisinitiative seek fundinglook at the portfolio determine whataccelerators what code what assets wehave to actually make this a successfulprogram together instead of I.T tryingto entirely drive it or the businesswith Shadow I.T rightso the prompts on the right are intendedto give people a chance to really thinkabout the maturityof the organizational construct I knowyou're all tired of hearing peopleprocess technology these slides todayand my messages it's not just about thetechnology the other two are actuallywhat makes it sustainable the processand the peoplethis is also about making difficultchoices to Sunsetwe havea obligation to be stewards in ourorganizations for the financial rigor ofour portfolio Cloud costs often are veryunderestimatedso unless you have a phenops program ora budding phenops program or at CloudCenter of Excellence that's managingthat and you're resourcing your taggingit can be completely out of controlso when you look at it as a cost takeoutwhich is you know again part of thisvalue leverhow do you tie the return on investmentfor a data program and also at the sametime say hey we're going to Sunset thesesix thingsby putting in this new Cloudinfrastructure some new Servicesself-service apis microservices data isa product a data Marketplace you have totie the two together they can't beindependentand then I would say lastly Persona LEDdesign there is an explosion in the manytypes ofpersonas in an organization you havedata analysts data scientists dataEngineers software engineersdevops I mean there's manythe the biggest thing that matters iswhen you think about the capabilitymatching to the personas so if you wantto implement you know a new set ofsandboxes and data exploration you haveto really think about who's going tointeract with this what is a reasonableexpectation of skill Readiness riskcomplexity for a data analyst in abusiness division to log in start usingthe sandbox start doing data wranglingwith production datanow I don't know about you but there aresome security concerns you can't just becopying data and have you know it therehas to be some structure and so when youstart to make it persona-led designyou can be much more prescriptive youcan think about role-based accesscontrols and the things that arenecessary to convince your executiveleadership to convince your securityteams and your risk we will be fullycompliant giving people better access todata to do their jobhas to be governed and stewarded andshepherded through a process where youcompletely rethink how people operatearound data itselfso in talking about the business in itcoming together we did this illustrationto say where is this business andtechnology meeting point we call thisthe bridge now this was originallysketched on a cocktail napkin I'm reallyexcited at how lovely it looks right nowmaybe for fun I should include in mypresentations from now on so you guyscan see it but the point isthe data therapy extends to business andI.T not always seeing eye to eye notalways having a shared understanding ofthe value of a project and certainly thebusiness has far deeper context for theway data should be used so I want totalk about data utility for a secondforeignI want you to think of a grocery storeyou're in the grocery store you're goingshopping and you can take anything offthe shelf and you can look at theingredients you can look at where it wasmanufactured and you know exactlyhow it's to be used right you're notgoing to go down the dog food aisle ifyou're hungry and take a snack and openthe dog food like that's that's poorutility right you know exactly what thatproduct's for and how it's supposed tobe used so I want you to think of a dataproduct that way you have to know theprovenance and the lineage where didthat data product come from what are itscontents how is it supposed to be usedwho is supposed to consume it rightthen I want you to think about thepharmacyso the pharmacy you can't just walk upto the pharmacy and take something offthe shelves you have to have aprescriptionand so a data product that is privacyenabled that is security enabled that isgoverned is like your own personalprescriptionit's for specific individuals with aspecific utility in need rightso again when we talk about thisbusiness and technology meeting pointthere has to be a contextualunderstanding for the data itself thedata utility and all of the things thatgo with data management that I showed inthe data management Spectrumthe other thing is around time to valueand metricswe see many organizationsthat have great successin setting up multi-cloud environmentsstarting to move applications but theyoften set aside a few things to comeback to laterone is Mainframe that comes in secondmany times and then the other is theirdata and analytics ecosystem datawarehouses right and part of the reasonthat they have a challenge withimmediately doing that in the sameprioritized listis because data warehouses start as asource for people to secure data thatthey need to do their job to use somebusiness intelligence tools to do somevisual Analyticsto use that data for machine learningmodels to train machine learning modelsbut inevitably what happens is someonehas an idea and it's not a bad one tostart tethering restful services to thatdata warehouse and it starts with onelike we're just going to have oneserviceit's just going to use a little bit ofthat data warehouse and then you turnaround and there's 500.so you want to move your data warehouseto the cloud and you're like oh we haveoperationally valid live productionweb services that now depend on that sothen you've got a whole second set ofitems that you need to migrate nowbusiness stakeholders when they hearthisthey are not pleased they're like whatdo you mean why it's the data warehousemigrate the data warehouse but then theyrealize that they are actually theconsumers of the web services againtransparent to them they might just havea web interface they're doing their joband now they're like oh so we have sometechnical debtand so when I say there needs to be anagreement between the business and I.Tit is having full transparency of theportfolio of assets everythingapplication code everything in the dataecosystem data products that are reallyimportant for defining how businessshould be run and modernizingand that's when we see that projectportfolio data assets business contextthat's exactly what I mean the items inpinkand on the right this is all the funstuff that everyone wants to dowe want to do data Ops we want to justhave everything on autopilot so it'seasier for data Ops requires humans youall know that now the good news is dataobservabilitymetadata there is a proliferation of newservices that do make it easier but itstill requires resources to be dedicatedto change managementand to long-term care and feeding dataOps ml Ops finops I'm going to make ananalogy how many of you have dogs orcatsdogs cats birds anything okayI'm going to make an analogy thatdata Ops ml Ops finops it is like petownershipit's forever you get the puppy so cuteyou get the food and the cage it'sforever it's not I'm going to play withit for a day and then it's just going tofigure it out so anything Ops pleaseremember it's not just that let's sayyou do have the resources great we have15 people we're going to immediatelymake them our Cloud apps data Ops ml OpsTeambut there's upskilling there's obviouslya challenge to find Talent and it has tobe something that changes over timethere's new Services every day there arenew Integrations every day new dataproducts every day so the care andfeeding of that is pretty significant sojust like the puppy who grows to be anadult needs more foodthere is this process that has to occurin your executive leadership need toknow it because they may say to you wellif it's Ops and it's automated don't youneed less people well no we don'tbecause as you're automating there'sjust more work there's more there's moreresources there's more assets and youhave to make sure that the businessstakeholders and executive leadershipare all in for a road map that is notjust Innovation but also contains thechange management and the operationssoI'm going to get a little bit more intothe technical part of the contentsI'm going to start with overlysimplified what do we consider the fourpillars of a modern data platform it'svery simple Cloud native self-servicedata as a product API integrationI'm very certain that the majority ofyou already have these pillars in somesemblance within your environmentsand the example that I'm going to usehere iseverything that you do should tie backto the business valueeverything that you do should tie to thepersonas that will interact in thatparticular pillar or across theenvironmentand you should always think back to thebridge am I doing something that istechnologically important but I haven'ttold any business stakeholders of theimpact right there is always that dancebetween the business and I.T that iswhat sustains a modern native platformbecause the only way that yourtechnology teams are going to be able togrow and flourishis if they are delivering business valueand it's a very disconnectedthing that we see in most organizationsand it's not for lack of interest it'sjust not stitching it together andcreating a cohesive community that meetin the middle of that bridge the bridgeis made of dataso metadata the data itself anunderstanding of your systems andunderstanding of the portfolio all ofthose things it becomes aself-fulfilling prophecy when you canshow the value I had this challenge as Iwas building My Cloudand my EA team and our data engineeringand data science functions I had toprove the value we were delivering so wecreated a business value assessmentwhere you're measuring before during andafter any data program any Cloud programthe actual business value delivered andmaking it quantitative it's not fluffyit's not it has to be numbers use thedata to tell the data story to justifywhy you are again wanting to growwanting to innovate and have morecontrol and more opportunityso this is a overly simplified but Ithink important what you know what do weconsider to be part of a datamodernization ecosystem you're going tonotice right off the bat everything is aserviceum I'm not going to get into adissertation about data fabric versusdata Mash it's an and not an orso data fabric obviously deeply rootedin use of metadata knowledge graphs datamesh being Federated data governanceI'm giving you the simplest definitionI'm sure there's many more and you allknow that but when we look at itall of the people in the middle waslovely little picture is really aroundpeople all going in the same directionand agreeing on the priorities for theirorganization Enterprise organizationoffering things as a service when it'sappropriate and upskilling the workforcethrough digital fluency and dataliteracyso behind thisthere's a reference architectureI'm sure you'll recognize many of thethings that are in here obviouslyeverything from connectivity to datasources all the way through you knowingestion storage processing insightsand actions this is prescriptive to yourorganization you may not need all of thethings shown here in this referencearchitecture but a frameworkfor understanding when and where youwant to create an offering imagine aservice catalog okay think like you knowa shared services organization that hasall of these things in the toolkit weoften use this as a heat map and we givea maturity score to some of theindividual components here in thereference architecture and say you knowuntil you get to a certain maturitypoint we probably don't recommend you doyou know X or Y and so this can be a gutcheck for an individual business areathat's maybe very opportunistic andexcited to do data science but you sayto them and still you until you start tocertify your data and have you knowprofiling and understand the quality ofyour data you really shouldn't start toadvance into some of the other thingsyou also have to have agreementthere is only so much funding there isonly so much time in peopleand the modernization ecosystemit's always best suited if you have afew Pilots so I'm a big advocate forthat if you have areas that are ready togo and they want to lean in and they youknow yes we want to invest our time andenergy and be part of this modernizationeffort they become your biggest fanshands downthey don't want to hear I.T talkingabout how great the new Cloudenvironment is but you get two businesspeople that had a successful experiencestanding up a new Cloud environment andthey have access to data and analyticsin a sandbox and apis you can there isnot enough money in the world to getsomething that good because the businessstakeholders they get the momentuminside the organization to tell thestory about how this investment wasworth it why it's adding value and thenyou're giving them away with those 10value levers to quantify it yes we didsell X number of widgets yes we wereable to improve efficiency you know by acertain percentageand then what it comes down to is andyou're going to recognize all the logoson here having something that is thebest in classCloud native service catalogrightnow this also means interweaving into itand I use a very specific example herethose ml flow and accelerators you seeKPMG ignite that's our AIML like we'remaking and eating or in dog food hererightinsert your accelerators your code yourscripts the things that make you you inyour organization your assetslay those on top of your Clouddeployment planeput a wrapper around them have a teamdedicated to launching those you don'tneed to reinvent the wheel when it comesto the base Services because they'rethey're Best in Classregardless ofthe portfolio of services you chose yourEnterprise architecture to it you chosethe vendors you're working with yourpartners leverage those relationships docode development it's going to get youto Market much much faster and there arealso some things here that are reallyimportant like having a certificationprocess raw clean processing trustedwhatever you want to call it Medallionarchitecture gold silver bronzeeverybody's got a different name for ita tiered architecture around curatingyour data products is absolutelyessential but there has to be agreementwhat does it take to certifywhat is the criteria that has to be hitif you think about a data product and wego back to the grocery store examplewould you put something on the shelfthat isn't top qualitythink about the ingredients think aboutthe provenance of it will peopleunderstand it will they consume itproperlyforeign and then lastly the consumptionso I've given just a couple exam this isnot a comprehensivearchitectural diagram here this is justan example of use cloud native Servicesdetermine where you're missinganything specific maybe it's a policiescode tool maybe it's a generative AIsynthetic data generation tool perhapsit's some other industry specificservice that you require fordoing business insert those things makesure that everyone in the Enterpriseknows how to use those services and makesure that the integration includes allof the same criteria you would have foryour own data products and your ownassetsis there data observability is theremonitoring is there alerting is itsustainable is it scalableis it cost prohibitive right all ofthose things should be true whether it'syour internal solution your internalcode base whether it's Cloud native orwhether it comes through a systemintegrator a vendor Etcdata's a team sport so it's also aroundextending that community that we showedwith the bridge it's business I.T andthen there's like an asterisk on I.Tit's all your partners and all yourvendorsand those that you're interacting withthis is um just to return to the dataproduct lifecycle there's one item Iwant to call out here and I do want toreserve a few minutes for questionsthere is an entirely new category ofdata products I call them derived dataproducts they are anything that is theoutput of this certification process nowthis process will be very familiar andcomfortable to anyone that does thesoftware development lifecyclehowever for business stakeholdersknowledge workers partners and others ifthey're not actively in the softwaredevelopment life cycle this may feelvery uncomfortable to them they're likewhat do you mean I have to start doingproactive and reactive data governancesector what does that even mean I haveto do a data quality scorecard I have tocheck it into the data Marketplace theseare things that they won't be familiarwith so show them Graceand help people understand that the dataproduct life cycle or the datadevelopment life cycleit's going to be okayand just like they are accustomed toseeing applications development done andsoftware delivered to themshow that overlap show that then and saywe're going to follow a similar processwhether you are waterfall agile agilesomething else whatever the familiarityis for the methodology that you'refollowing for delivering applicationsand services start to intermingle thosedata product life cycle components andthen when you get to the point that youhave a derived data product and that istwo data products being used togetherthe output of an AIML model right a newdata product that didn't exist beforemaybe for the first time ever you'regiving a business division access todata that they were never able to havebefore and they take that and do someamazingly creative things with it wellthat derived data product can becertified and it can be put in a dataMarketplace and it can be shared thelevel of innovation and creativity isunlimited if you look at data productsthe right way and really getting intothat curation process you're alsoempowering data owners and data stewardsto finally understand that there's adefinition for for these jobs thatthey've been doing they didn't evenrealize how important it was to thecuration of data for the Enterpriseand then lastly because again we've gotto talk about AI a little bit I want toshare another exampleof something that's a Cornerstone forhow you operate in the future around amodern data ecosystem this is ourresponsible AI framework I thinkeveryone should have one hopefully youare thinking about and forming thetechnology people and processimperatives in your organizations to doresponsible AI I've listed some of themajor themes I hope this will be usefulto you but I've also listed at thebottomour accelerator categories again yourown code and your people or yourgreatest asset they have the knowledgeto create accelerators whether it becode Frameworks best practices run booksleverage those people turn some of thosethings into assets that are reusable soyou have one data science team thatisn't completely Reinventing the wheelwhen there's four other data scienceteams in the company that are producingexactly the same assets so it's reallygetting that portfolio concept theservice catalog concept intact don'tjust think of your service catalog asyour Cloud native service catalog likethink of it more comprehensively openthe aperture on what you would considerto be important and start to socializethatone of the last things I'll mention isdo a technology conference in-houseso many people don't ever get toexperience thisbusiness stakeholdersthey've never been to a Tech Conferencethey've never had conversations aboutexciting topics about how you canrenovate and transform bring it to themdo an in-house Expodo a data Expo where you inviteeverybody in the company to comevirtually or physically and you open upthe portfolio of all your data productsand all your assets and then you inviteyour partners and vendors to come in anddo trainingand you and you teach people thefundamentals of what is a modern dataecosystem look like how do we allparticipate in the team sportand then it really helps you becauseyou're going to have Advocates that aregoing to help you Lobby when you want toprioritize certain initiativesapplications development whatever it maybe because then you're going to have abusiness person that says I vote forthat too I'm ready to move my workloadsto the cloud I'm ready to get rid ofthis old Legacy data warehouse I want adata Lake I want to start usingservices that help me understand my databetter metadata is for everyoneit's not just for I.T people rightmetadata is itself a data product thatshould be shared leveraged consumedand so in closing we're going to haveabout 10 minutes for questionsthese are the things that I think aretop of mindum like I saidwe didn't have the luxury of going downthe rabbit hole on every singleGoogle cloud service I'm happy to speakwith any of you about themI think the goal that I wanted tocommunicate was please consider thepeople in process part of the moderndata ecosystembecause you can build the serviceseasily you can hook them upthat the data deployment plane is veryclearif you walk into the Expo there arehundreds of providers that have toolingbut you have to return it to what is thebusiness value does this simplify mytechnology portfolio does this help meLeapFrog some capability in theenvironment that delivers business valuedoes it help me reduce my costsdoes it simplify or provide somethingreally satiating while my company isgoing through a much longertransformation fill in the blank ofwhatever kindum but it also has to be driven ontrusted metrics and kpis if you don'thave a data scorecard that has metricsand kpis for how well you're deliveringdata whether it's being adopted consumedif you don't have metrics on what is theaverage time to Value what's the averagetime for people to acquire a data setwhat is the average time to insights howmany reports do we have have cobwebs onthem and skeletons hanging off the sidebecause nobody's touched the report in17 years right if you're not pruning andyou're not keeping yourselvesaccountable with data metrics and kpison a monthly basisI would suggest that there's anopportunity for improvement there andthen certainly organizational alignmentHR organizations are starting to partnermuch more closely with itis to redefinepeople's job descriptionscitizen data scientists citizendevelopers low code no code open sourceall of these things have dramaticallychanged the types of Technology rolesthat are not just relegated to I.T theyexist in the business they exist withpartners and vendors and you want tomake sure that you're retaining yourpeople by actually adding to their jobdescription the types of activitiesthey're doing within this datamodernization ecosystemand then obviously scalableinfrastructure and services you wouldn'tbe here if you weren't interested inmaking the most of the latest andgreatest offering but again it's onefacetum I think it's incredible I'm soexcited about some of the announcementsthat were made this morning and I haveone last question before we takequestions from the audience and that isis your dataspurring people to actionand if it's notI would really think about go deep intothat data therapy what's missing whyaren't people using all of these dataproducts why aren't they using the newsystem we implemented are you spurringthem to action and if you're notmake it sothat's it for me[Music]"
