    "transcript": "foreign[Music]Welcome to our session about upskillingyour career with generative Ai andGoogle cloud trainingI'm Emma Freeman I'm a learningportfolio manager which is a lot like aproduct manager for our learning contentand I'm focused specifically on all ofour learning content about AI machinelearning and data analyticsincluding generative AIand after I talk we will bring up myco-presenters and I'll allow them tointroduce themselves as well we're alsogoing to have time for a q a at the endthere is a microphone in the aisle thereso if you'd like to ask questions at theQ a at the end please go ahead and lineup when we get to that section and we'dbe happy to take your questionsso I'm just very grateful to you all forbeing here today excited to talk aboutthis gen AI thing that has been you knowin the news a little bit latelyum and then I'll also be sharing withyou today about kind of uh currentindustry Trends around gen AI related toskills and careers and ways that you cankind of plug yourself into what'shappening in the world and think aboutthat with regards to your current job oryour future job and your careerso everybody's been asking what does genAI mean for job roles what does it meanfor my job or for the job I might bedoing in a year or jobs in generalthere's a lot of talk about are therobots going to steal our jobs iseverything going to be completelyautomated what does it mean for a lot ofthe more technical roles that arestarting to have a lot more generativeAI Technologies and tools integratedinto our workflowsand there's a lot of interest in whatkind of skills that people need to beable to adapt to this kind of newreality where gen AI is becomingintegrated into everybody's workflowbut no matter what there's no doubt thatthat Jenny I will is transforming everyindustry every jobit's really a paradigm shift and I'llpause for a moment to let you read thisquote on the sidethe majority of developers today believethat their workflow will be different ina year because of AI tools according toa stack Overflow surveyand another survey done by Goldman Sachsfound that 300 million jobs around theworld stand to be impacted by Ai andautomationwe're looking at significant disruptionpotentially on the horizon for the labormarketand a lot of studies are also showingthat up to two-thirds of jobs willprobably be automated at least to somedegree with Gen AI toolsbut as we've seen in the pasttechnological innovation doesn't justeliminate jobs although a of coursethere's always the potential for certainkinds of jobs to phase out and shift butanother big change is that it createsnew jobs and starts incorporating newkinds of skills and in fact most peopleare actually looking to gen AI to helpalleviate their workloads and make themmore productive make the kind of some ofthe more drudgery type tasks of theirjobs be more fully automatedup to 70 of people are looking todelegate as much work as they can to Aiand Business Leaders as wellare more likely to say that the valuethey see in AI is an increasingproductivity rather than reducing headcount so that's good news for all of usand just out of curiosity can I have ashow of hands of who here works and whatyou would consider a technical rolecool looks like majority of usand ofall of you how many of you are alreadyseeing gen AI being Incorporated andpart of your workflowyeah so when we talk about the futurewith Gen AI it's obviously alreadyhappening and everybody's experiencing aneed for adapting and shifting whatkinds of skills are relevant but there'sa lot of questions around what skillsexactly are relevant and importantso here's some ideas about some of thetop skills working with Gen Ai andyou'll notice that these are not thetechnical skills of how to use the toolsthese are more focused on maybe what youwould call soft skills or transferableskills and this is what I kind of wantto drill into because this is where alot of opportunity lies to make yourselfstand out in the workforce and to reallythinkum you know all of us especially all ofyou who just raised your hands will bedeveloping if you haven't alreadydeveloped those more technical skillsworking with the Gen AI tools but thesekinds of skills will always be necessaryand important so moral executive typeskills including transparency fairnessempathy responsibility all of theseethical practices around avoiding biaswith implementing AIcreativity adaptability and problemsolvingthese are skills that will beincreasingly in demand as gen AIadoption growthand then data literacy and vigilance isalso increasingly important and criticalfor the success of AI including theability to Common Sense and fact checkthe outputs that AI gives usso we see that a lot of employers areprioritizing these kinds of skills likecreativity and problem solving alongsidethe technical skills for roles insoftware development data scienceinfrastructure any any role that reallyworks with AI toolsandwe're saying that the technical rolesthemselves are evolving as AI becomesmore integrated into everybody'sworkflows across the boardum I kind of think of this as people whoare using the output of the AI toolsversus people who are building thosetools or setting them up or setting upthe infrastructure or the securitylayers all of that around the AI toolsand this is just my opinion of kind of away to group these types of roles ofcourse there's a lot of different waysto slice and dice it but there's rolesthat involve setting up the systemsobviously we can't Implement AI toolswithout having really robust dataarchitecture data securityall of the data engineering work thatneeds to go into that so even thoughsome of these roles may not beas top of mind when it comes to what arethe top new roles related to workingwith Gen AI these roles are stillcrucial for the ability to implement anddeploy AI Solutions so you know dataarchitect or security engineer all ofthose and then we have the mlpractitioners and these are the rolesthat I think are moreumdirectly impacted bydeveloping and building AI related toolsso you know a research engineer orresearch scientists data scientists mlengineer they may be working with out ofthe box models also doing some tuningtraining their own versions anddeploying AI models into their workflowand then there's kind of broad categoryand of course I do want to caveat thiswith there's overlap between these thisis not a rigid boundary but Jenny I endusers so people who are maybe moreinteracting with the apis to call thepre-training models like an appdeveloper or data analysts customersupport agents people who are more usingthe pre-built models out of the boxandthere's also talk about a role calledprompt engineer and I'm using this asjust an example of roles that are newterms for things that maybe didn't existuntil fairly recentlyum and I've heard a lot of Buzz usingthis term prompt engineer and have had alot of conversations with people askingthem what do you think about this isthis a real job is it a job for rightnow is it a job for the futureI think there will continue to be morejoblikethe engineer is anotherwherewhere somebody who can work with thetools as they're built now so a promptengineer would be somebody who's veryfamiliar with how to promptum an AI to get the output that you'relooking for and the output that's usefulbutI think that we're going to see thatthese types of roles that kind of pop upin reaction to the evolving landscapemay eventually settle out and trickleinto all other job roles so I think inthe near future everybody's going to bea prompt engineer you know it from abusiness executive to more technicalpeople we're all going to need to knowhow do you interact with Bard or othergen AI models to get the best outputs soit may be tempting to rush out and get adegree or whatever people are gettingwith the prompt engineer titleum but I think it's good to kind ofthink longer term about what are thecore skills that are going to be neededand no matter where you were at in thatspectrum ofum no code to high code slightlytechnical technical adjacent to highlytechnicalthere's lots of ways to interact withGen AI tools and on Google Cloud we haveout of the box Solutions with Gen AI sothese are tools that you don't actuallyneed to know how to code so if you'rethinking that gosh this Jenny I think isbig I need to go out and learn to codenot necessarily truewhether you're coding or not you'restill interacting with those tools indifferent waysthere'sum you know application developers orother folks who are working to customizesome of the tools that are already outthere and interact with them and thatcan be some code or a lot of codingand then there's AIML practitioners whohave more advanced skills working withML and AI who are customizing the modelsand doing all that so as you can seethere's a spectrum of what the skillslook like and how much coding you reallyneed to learnokay so with that I will hand it off toKellywho will talk aboutto start thinking about getting theseskills thanksthank you hi there how good you can hearme thank you so much hi my name is KellyThompson and I probably did a faux pasbut I did put my email on there so I dowant feedback but I'll tell you a littlebit why in the next slideso as Emma just mentioned we're allbecoming programmers so I've met acouple you in the last couple days I'mlooking forward to meeting more of youum as the year goes on my name is KellyThompson and I head up the curriculumdevelopment program for AIML and dataengineering so work really closely withEmma when you meet Gwendolyn she's alsoa peer of mine so one of the things thatI wanted to talk about today waswhen I started my career I was a teacherand had an elementary school teacher andin 2000 I heard this big hype about theinternetso I started my career in a database uhSQL Oracle and in a server room for manyyears realized that I liked people so Igot out of there but um I programmed andit took me about six years to beconsidered an I.T professional welltoday it takes less than two yearsso what what does that mean well whatthat means for us for Google is thatwe've actually revamped our educationprogram and we'll continue to do thatwe've got to be able to help upscale assoon as possible so what I wanted to sayin this slide is specifically is thatwe're all programmers today as as Emmajust shared depending on if you want todo some dive deep dive into AI or if youwant to have a little bit more so one ofthe things I'm going to show you todayis a little bit of what we can do atGoogle Cloudso one of the three things that we'vereally changed this year yes and I'veincluded all the URLs I heard that youwill get some of these slides but I haveincluded my email and I've includedanother email this is really importantyou know one of the things I think ifyou walk away today is if you canremember that we do a platforms tosupport you and for all different peopleas they're learning their Journey so oneof the key things that we've launched alot more this year is really videoswe've interviewed subject matter expertsproduct owners you might even see a fewfolks as you're going through theconference you'll be grabbed and saidhey can you give us a video we'veextended our YouTube channel for freevideos for all we've also extended ourplatform which was is called skillsBoost used to be called quick labs forsome of our folks that have been with usfor a while and we continue to extendour platform there one of the thingsthat we've spent a lot of time this yearif you've seen and if you haven't seenit yet go downstairs into the trainingcertification we've got a lot of Badgesand certification just things for us asindividuals and also for managers tolook at to extend the team's knowledgeso take a look at that and then what weintroduce this year which you may or maynot have heard of it's called arcade soit's more of an arcade style game anyonecan join you can also as you earn youcan earn credits for swag you can earncredits for a donation but it's a lot offun so it gets folks and it's reallymore technical we're spending across notonly just gen AI but we're learning alldifferent pieces of our product sodefinitely check these three things outthese three areasso what I wanted to show you a littlebit here so as you're all going throughyour gen III Journey we are toofrom a curriculum developmentperspective and what I wanted to sharewith this slide with all of you was ifyou remember back at the beginning ofthis year there was a big announcementon gen Ai and Google and some othercompanies that you may have heard ofum and basically they asked us from acurriculum development perspective weneed to get content out as soon aspossible so the great thing is here isthat we actually started using gen AI toaccelerate our programs so as you cansee in this is that within a coupleweeks we were able to actually launchnine micro learning courses with 67assets we use Bard we also use humansyou can see the percentage and the otherpercentage which is about 24 if I'mdoing it right 26 was really someAutomation in our products and so whatour goal is over the next year is thatyou're going to see we're going to gomuch faster we're going to start usingthe Gen AI Technologies and we're goingto start sharing that as well so that wecan show you what we're doingthe other thing here you see that wehave nine mini micro courses but thetotal time was two and a half hours ifyou've seen some of our courses from thepastthey take a little bit longer than twoand a half hours so we're also trying toTarget specifically on your needs yourteam's needs as well this also playsinto certification so of course there'ssome more details around deeperknowledge for certification but one ofthe things that we're looking at inparticular is that we're looking at waysto I can show this let me do thisso I don't know if you can see this butthis is the topic over on Google searchso you know beginning I mean end of lastyear 2002 the word generative AI reallylow then come a and it's shot up so oneof the things that we're looking at areterms that you're all searching foraround the globe and we're making surefrom an education perspective that we'reincluding that in our training so we'rewatching that as well understandingbecause like Emma just showed andGwendolyn talked more about itterms are coming prop you know these newtitles these new roles so we want tomake sure that we're able to educate youon those terms and what that meansmy next slideone of the things that I would talk toyou a little bit about this in a secondisfrom a perspective of my team and Ithink everybody in the trainingcertification we really want thefeedback from all of you we're lookingto surveys that you complete at the endof training sessions we're looking atemails we're looking at your comments onYouTube and what we've been doing iswe've been actually taking that feedbackand making pretty rapid changes in ourcontent curriculum as well as in ourspills boost platform so please continuethat what I'm showing you here these arethe top three about a month ago and welooked at the feedback the good feedbackalso the feedback was like we want moreLabs we want more interactive so theexciting news is that we're currentlypiloting with some other customers andlove they get your contributions as wellif you're interested to look at waysthat we can build shorter videos andshorter Hands-On labsand using our generative AI technologyto give you an example one thing we'redoing is looking at ways of skill setsso that we can actually assess what arethe skill sets you or your team membersneed as we know we always hope ourleaders and managers will help usupscale but it comes to us asindividuals a lot so we understand thatso we're really trying to personalizeyour Learning Journey and by doing thisthe things that we're learninginternally we're also going to be ableto share out to the rest of you too sowhen you can go into skills boost in thefuture you'll be able to say I want tobecome in this new role maybe like Emmamentioned go in there and say what arethe courses I should take what's acertification path so really excitedthat we're actually going to start usingour own technology and sharing out toall of you as wellcoursesokay great all right good yeah you knowtake a look at them they're on YouTubelike I said you can use it on your phoneor you can log into skills boost love tohear look at your feed but you'llrecognize a couple people in my nextpresenter as well and some of those soum and we work really closely with withall the different teams within Googleso I one thing that I'd really like foryou to take away today from my sectionis where can you find us so I'd reallysuggest logging in getting an accountwith skills boosts our videos we're evenoffering some free skill badges today Idon't know how long they're gonna lastbut I'll find that out for you but youknow you can go in today get some skillsboost badgesyou can also if you don't want to loginto skills boost you can follow us onthe Google YouTube channel and not onlyare we using these platforms these areour main platforms we are partneringwith Coursera LinkedIn learning andpluralsight so you'll still see us thereum as wellso on that one I'm going to pass it on Imean I did have left wait till Gwendolyncomes up we did not plan our outfits sobut we are wearing a blue blazer so thatwas not part of we might have did aphoto later so thanks Gordon come on upwell the only anomaly actually is thatEmma is wearing female pink sandal Hillsokayso umso my name is Gwendolyn Striplingand IMD technical curriculum developerhere at Google Cloudand I want to begin by sayingthat we areat an inflection pointin so many waysour careerspoint takenour careersour Technologiesyou know the world is changing around usand we are blessed enoughto be in this room at this moment intimeat the Apex of this inflection pointso how can we hearat Google Cloud Learning Services helpyouif youwant to design prompts you've heardabout prompt engineering or pump designyou don't have any coding experienceno worriesyou can use gnai Studio to help youdesign promptsif you have a little coding a littlepython a little rmaybe some SQLand you want to go beyond that no codesolution using gnai Studio you can alsomove in the direction of using ourvertex APIwithin our gmai studio you go to the GUIor you can go to the APIwhen you go to the API we also offernotebooks who's heard of Jupiternotebooksthank you I um I gave a class yesterdayon intro to jnaiand I had given it two days in a rowandI didn't ask this question the first daybut I decided to ask it yesterdayand when I askedyou know who's heard of a jupyternotebook out of70 people about three people raisedtheir handsand then I got really excited and alsoreally awarethere is so much to sharethere's so much to shareso when I'm talking about a Jupiternotebook we at Google offer Googlecollab free browser-based Jupiternotebook you don't need any codingskillsto use it inside of vertex AI we haveworkbench which allows you with a littlebit of coding knowledge to use PythonJupiter notebooks inside of vertex Aiand I believe as of last weekwe have Enterprise collab inside ofvertex AIyeah yeah it's excitingand if you do have some codingexperienceand you want to move from low code inyour Learning Journey tosome coding to sort of I live in thecode worldwe can help you there as wellwe can show you how touse Kodi which is our cogeneration llmto write codeto debug codeto actually tell you what it's doingline by lineand to help you write code Source Docsyeah that's really excitingand you can also build apps using ournew search and and conversationthis name was just changed this is ourgen app builder if you've heard of thatas of a few days ago so it's calledsearch and conversationand finallyif you already have an AI ml backgroundyour data Sciences you work in theindustrythen you can start to develop and Deployon vertex AI immediatelyyou can customize and deploy Foundationmodelsfrom fine-tuning them to fine-tuningtest specific models which I'll talkabout in a momentsoall that is to sayour course contentmeets you where you areon your Learning Journeyso Kelly andEmma have talked about our content andwhat we're providing I'm justreinforcing that hereum we have nine free courses on YouTubehas Kelly spoke ofum the intro to Gene AI course that wereleasedin May on May 10th of this yearWithinthree hours it had 7000 viewsas of this morningwithin the last three monthsit has 798000 viewsrest assured I was praying that forthose two more thousand people to get meover the 800 000 markso hint hint if you haven't seen itthank youbut what does that meanyou know when we we're building thiscourse we saw a gapyou knowin Novembereverything changed in terms of people'sability to understand what Gene AI wasand there were all these questions andso we saw a gap and we thoughtthat if we just looked at the basicsagain meeting people where they arethat we could help people understand thebasics of jnaiand I think the fact that we're almostat 800 000 views in less than threemonthsum you know helps us realize that weachieved that goalum we also have Hands-On labsand we also have credentialssoumour labswe add a bit of theorywhere needed excuse meand this is my third speaking engagementthis week so I apologize for ummy voiceI used to be a professional trainer andum my voice had was like could deal withfive days a week you know eight to fivebut apparentlyI'm a little rustyso we do have Hands-On labs andcredentialsandso our Labs add a bit of theory whereneededand visualsto enhance the learning process orexperienceso what I love about our labsis thatwe guide you through a workflow and I'vebeen here at Google four years when Istarted I looked at our labs and Ithought oh great there was work for meto doI can help improve these labs andimprove a learner's journey and my othercolleagues as well were like let's justmake it easier for people to walkthrough our labs and this philosophyhas improved our csat scoresand it has increased the number ofLearners in these last four years forCLS and we will continue to do that aswe develop our micro learning coursesand other courses as wellfor examplein one of our new Labs the exploreevaluatesmodel Gardenwe give you we show you three categoriesof modelsfoundationfine-tunable and tax specificand then in that lab after we've givenyou a bit of theory and contextwe didn't show you how to buildan object detection model using VisionTransformers open workopen I'm losing my what's becausesomeone help me hear open workopen workingtowel okay we'll just we'll go withoutokayum lots of acronyms in our in our uhopen worldthank youto myself because no one helped me thankyou very muchum open Vision Transformer open worldlocalization for object detection and sowith that you go into this notebookrightyou go through the workflow this littlebit of the theoryand then you see this great codewhat I started out in this professionwhat I would not have givenfor someone to give me the keys to thekingdom right we do thatso if you even have a little of a codingbackground or a little interest incoding this lab can help you because itshows you how to upload a pre-j apre-trained model to a model registry invertex AIhow to deploy the model to an endpointand how to run the model for onlinepredictionsthis lab from design using Palm webasically take you through questionanswering experimenting with differentparameter values and also exploringsummarization with models on vertex AIso those are just two of our new Labs wewill be creating more labs and makingthem available to youso what's nextmy apologies I'm just catching up withmy slides hereso we have two learning pathswe have a new course introduction togenerative Ai and it's free as you knowwe've it's been out for a while we havea coursefor developers we have two learningpaths developers and the gene Aiand we have the two coursesintroduction to Ai and ML on GoogleCloudand also responsible AI applyingprinciples with Google Cloudand I've also just walked you throughour our two Labs that we have availablewe're also open to lab ideasand feedback as wellexcuse methank you very much for your time todayumit's so great to see you all hereforeign"
