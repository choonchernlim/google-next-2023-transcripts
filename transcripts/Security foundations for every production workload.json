going to find anythingso sorry I gotta make that joke it kindof tells my age rightum well I'm Adrian Corona I'm the go tomarket lead for Security Solutions hereat Google Cloud uh super happy andthrilled to be here with you todayumtoday I'm going to tell you a little bitaboutum security foundation and which is aGoogle's perspective on on securityworkloads on running security for cloudworkloads but joining me today or latertoday we're going to have a great panelwith our friends from Mayo Clinic andGoogle cloud services and last but notleast we're going to have we're going toleave some time for traditional q a Iwill ask you if you have questions toask please come up to the microphone soeverybody can hear your questions andyour lovely voice will be recorded forthe posterity on the recorded sessionsin YouTube so you'll be you'll have thatgoing on for you guys all right um let'sget going so let's start a little bit ofa brief overview of what securityFoundation isit's no secret pretty much everyorganization in the planet is usingcloud in one way or anotherum and it's growing at scale verysignificant rate and security is a veryimportant it's a primary concern for allof our customers and all of the ourusers there's new threats coming inevery single day and now we've seen thatmore and more we see those thoseresearches in in malicious things beingposted very quickly in in the andthey're made available to pretty muchanyone to use and attack your belovednetworks and they're being released on avery alarming ratewe also have Cloud compliance if you ifyou're in this room you probably careabout security for your Cloud you runsome Cloud program in your companythrough organizations and you mostlikely care about compliance right so weallum I guess the way I want to put it iswhen we think about Cloud compliances weall want to beum not in the news or not be the nextone or even worse in jail right socompliance is a big deal for everybodyum a very common question when I speakto customers is um they ask me Adrian ismy cloud secureI think that the line of questioningneeds to change a little bit more intoam I using the cloud securely right Iknow it sounds subtle but what what doesthat meanum I'm sure that most of you here knowthat um about the shared responsibilitymodel when you talk about Cloud rightwhich is a basically splitting theresponsibilities from a club provider tothe cloud management to the CSP and whatthe customer needs to be doing that is amodel that pretty much works and it hasits advantages but in some situationsleaves our customers atum they have to make decisions that mayor may not be very well informed aboutlike hey if maybe I'm coming in from anew Cloud that I don't know about and umI don't know what controls the securitycontrols are offerings you're giving meor maybe I'm new to the cloud altogetherso I really don't know what what's goingon for me so Google understands this andwe're trying to be an ally for you whatdoes that means we're creating a numberof things assets to make it simple foryou to start in the Cloud we try to bethere at every step of the way and whatdoes that means if we have differentprograms I recommend you it's not theit's not part of this conversation butif you're looking to and Google the riskProtection Program for example is one ofthe things we've done as Google toreally put our money where a mouth isumwith security Foundation we created thisthis type of program to help customersto get ramped up on security through alist of assets that you can use to tomanage your security those assets comein the number in the name of blueprintsterraform scripts so you can build asecurity Landing Zone but um this thisis great a secure Landing zone is greatif you are new to the cloud or you'rejust building something from the groundup but not only for that like some ofthese assets and some of these whitepapers are also going to be helpfulhelpful if you're already running acloud practice and you just want to makesure that your security is running ifyou're running your Cloud securelyremember that first thing that Imentionedum the the components that we focus onare things like network securitymonitoring malware those type of thingsthat we know that are important for allof our customers all of you probablycare about those things when you'retalking about Cloud security but nowthe way we did it is we try to do it alittle bit differentum we're not just trying to push productwe're not just going to come in and tellyou hey this product does this this isthe capability so we kind of took a stepback and thought and try to make a listof what are the most common scenariosthat customers run in the cloud so wehave a short list outOutlets we sort of analyzed that listand said okay what are some of the mostcommon security risks that we seeassociated with these things so we thinklikeum we map those risks to each one ofthese use cases and for example I cantell you if if you're running secure AIwhich by the way it would not be aconference if I don't say Ai andsomewhere I don't put we I had to makemy quota for AI today so that's that'sme making that moneyum but like think about it like I'mbuilding a new llm model and I want tomake sure that there's no data leakagearound data exfiltration by a maliciousactor trying to just to trick my mylanguage model into giving meproprietary information from it so howdo you do that there's some tools thatcan help you with that so those arerisks that are common or if you're justa traditional lift and shift data centermigration you're you're bringing in someVMS into into Cloud well you're probablygoing to care about OS vulnerabilitiesmisconfigurationsmy networking firewalls that kind ofstuff rightnow let's think aboutuma sample architecture of what we offerso I mentioned security foundations is aset of assets that are at your disposalto start getting started right to togive you that Foundation if you'rebuilding a house we're going to give yousome things like here's here's thefoundation here's the type of Windowsthat you need here's the types ofsecurityum devices that you need to protect youryour house right or if it's a buildingwell maybe we're going to tell you thatas wellum this is a very simple one of thesample architectures for one of ourSolutions where we talk about modernapplication security there's a few morebased on the use cases that I alreadyspoke about and for example herewe're trying to solve for three majorproblems protecting the Integrity ofyour code protecting the Integrity ofyour data and making sure that yourapplications perimeter is also protectedso with that we have like three majorthings I'm thinking about from thebottom-up access we have some tools likeCloud I am thinking about like I'mprotecting the uh provenance of my notonly my customers but also thedevelopers that get access to the datathat's underlying on the on myapplication through identity aware proxyin Cloud IM I can provide thosefront-end identity services to myapplicationthe second one is supply chain I knowsupply chain is if it's a topic initself so I'm not going to go too deepinto it we created Frameworks like salsafor example and we have our softwaredelivery shield with our somecapabilities that help you to buildsecure code but also we have things likeartifact registry and artifact analysisthat are it's going to look into theactual code and containers it's going tolook for vulnerabilities as you'rebuilding your application into in atraditional CI CD pipeline so as you cansee in here things like binaryauthorization just quick race of handshow many of you have heard about binaryauthorizationokay that's a good number but still lowI would say binary authorization issuper cool I would strongly suggest youto do a little bit more research I putsome information here in the slides foryou to look at butum that's what Google uses to make surethat we have we're in binaryauthorization it enables you to do anenforcement and auditing to ensure thatonly known binaries can be run in yourenvironment and and all that it's donethrough certificates and attestationsthat are cryptographically verified sowhy is this important like here atGoogle we can pretty much identify anysingle binary that is running YouTube orany of our services and we can tie thatup specifically to an individual becausethat's signed with that that binary issigned with that individual's key so youcan expand this this is something thatwe use and Google does that a lot wecreate things so to run our stuff andfrom there we just make it a product foreverybody to enjoy so binaryauthorization is one of those thingsthat's going to help you with yoursupply chain because even if you get atsome point you get some code insertedinto your platform you're going to beable to understand and the binary isgoing to be different so you're notgoing to run that particular applicationbecause it's not authorized to do so andlast but not least we have complianceright so we care about compliance andruntime so so runtimeum security Command Center web securityscanner is going to look at yourapplications your applications code andit's going to try to identifyvulnerabilities for it and it's alsogoing to look into the compliance ofyour application and your Cloud postureso it's going to tell you things likehey you probably have this role that orthis user that has a lot of differentroles that you shouldn't that are notlikely or or are a little bit too muchof what's needed for this particularuser or things like Cloud armor when youthink about the perimeter Cloud armor isis one of my dearly beloved productsbecause it's sitting in in on top of thesame architecture that Google is usingto run protection for our services likethink about how many vdos attacks we getin YouTube and Gmail every single dayright so Cloud armor is using that sameinfrastructure and what it's doing ishelping you to protect from a layer 7type of attacks if you're curious intoif about it you can read our blog postsand how Cloud armor was able to thwartthe largest DLS attack in the history ofmankind it was like 46 million requestsper second and we were just easily ableto do so so imagine you having thatpower Just by including farmer as partof your architecturenow this is security foundations there'sa lot more Google has a giganticsecurity portfoliobut um foundationally these are some ofthe things that we believe that are thevery minimum things that you need to runyour stuff securely the part of the uhthe assets that we provide againterraform scripts to deploy a POC veryquickly white papers where you can seeand read and understand why what each ofthese components do it's available toyou at no cost butI want to say that don't just here justdoesn't take my word for granted rightnow what I want to do is I want toinvite uh Wade holmesman to your friendto man the panel here with our friendsfrom Mayo Clinic and po PSL services orGoogle Professional Services and they'regoing to tell you a little bit moreabout how they did it in real life andthey're going to tell you about theirstory in their Journey so please welcomeuh Wade and teamall right awesome thank you Adrian[Applause]good afternoon everyonelet me start off with a couple intros myname is Wade Holmes and I'm the globallead of security solution managementwithin Google cloud and excited to behere with my friend John Jay go ahead soI'm John Stricker I'm the lead softwareengineer for the neurology AI program atthe Mayo ClinicCloud engineer at Google I am part ofgcat and from security and complianceteamso here at Google Cloud we're extremelypassionate about working with ourcustomers with Partners to make surethat we're able to provide a secureinfrastructure and being able to do sois not only about being able to provideproducts and product capabilities butit's also about being able to increasethe business agility of our customers bybeing able to ensure security is bakedin into the architecture in the rightway so I'm super excited to hear aboutJohn's story and the journey that MayoClinic has gone on and also to be ableto talk to the nanje and talk about howServices have helped John and MayoClinic down this journey so John tell mea little bit about that Journey yeahsure so first I'm going to tell you alittle bit about the neurology AIprogram so in the next slide you'll seethat we're an interdisciplinary team ourgeneral approach is that you need tohave information technology datascientists and clinical expertise all onthe same team working together to solveproblems we're a clinically appliedgroup meaning in all of our work ourresearch is all about clinicalapplications direct it's not abouttranslationalso on the next slideI can tell you your general mission iswhat we want to do is modernize theneurological exam we want to take AIanalysis and we want to be able todisplay the results of those analyzes toneurologists in ways that they can useto help them train help them give usfeedback to their patients help themdiagnose patients so here you see stateof the art at Mayo Clinic here's whatour director David Jones does when he'sdoing training you need to have a lot ofslides you need to be able to makecomparisons between different brainscans to be able to indicate or to learnwhat are the differences here becauseit's it's a bit of an art not so much ascience we want to turn it into ascience and make it directly applicableand usable inside and outside of MayoClinic and on the next slide you can seewhat that looks like now this is Stateviewer this is our product that'srunning on Google Cloud inside MayoClinic right now this takes an AInetwork analysis neighborhood networkanalysis it lets you see how much alikeis a given brain like another sort ofbrain so you can see it provides aneighborhood analysis you get a sense ofspatial similarity between the brainsneurologists have been using this notjust to make the diagnosis in a systembut then to turn around and be able todiscuss this with their patients it'sactually they found it to be very usefulto be able to say your brain's a lotlike this person's and you kind of seehow the similarities are here so this isan example the kind of technology andwe're just getting started so in thenext slidethat's with fdg PET Imaging as its corefor State viewer but we want to goacross modalities one of the otherthings we need to do we need to get uhbetter data so our a lot of ourcognitive tests for example are decadesold we need modern cognitive testing weneed to be able to have modern ways ofcollecting speech gait a lot of otherthings that are a lot of othermodalities that are also going to beuseful and are part of the generalneurological exam but they also areusually very informal or you have to goto a very specialized lab to get thatdata so we are spinning up softwareapplications that allow us to getcognitive testing we're working towardsmodernizing gate analysis as well and wealso are working towards EEG data and aswell we have this whole ecosystemeventually the idea is we want to beable to go across modality too so wemight have fdg pet data and be able tosay well your brain looks a lot likethis but it would help us out a wholelot if we could get some speech samplesoh by the way here's a link you can goand it'll across the web get speechsamples for you so then you can sort oflike collapse across modalities and feelin the blanks figure out what you needso understandably this is a prettyambitious goal and on the next slide Iwant to talk a little bit about where wewere a year ago we already had Stateviewer with fdg pet data but we couldn'trun her anywhere we had developed asoftware we did not know where we'regoing to put it Mayo was doing some fairamount of work with Google Cloud but wedidn't see like a clear path towardsbeing able to put this in production wewere working with Phi Mayo is obviouslyvery very sensitive about any any sortof security risk as well and we neededto move faster and be able to iterate inproduction so we teamed up with ourexecutive group so Vish and Jim andStacy and other people from me oit hadalready established some patterns but Ialso said we need a team I need help andthat's when we got Google PSO involvedDonna Jay and like in particular andthey got on board with us and they gotto work so over the next year we notonly put State viewer into productionbut we put together basically a planform for all of our products so we not Iwould have just been happyover a year ago to just have one thingrunning but instead what we were able todo is set up basically a platform thatallows us to easily put new products inand start to integrate themoh that is awesome John and that is avery exciting story and to tie in AI tobe able to build a platform using secureGoogle cloud services is is veryinterestingum can you talk a little bit more aboutsome of the specific Google cloudservices that you used in this platformyeah so here's what we call uh ourGoogle Cloud run service pattern so thisis one thing that's helped us immenselywe have a lot of oversight internally sowe have a technology Assurance processesand things like that one of the thingsthat you wanted that has helped us a lotis we have other groups like Cloudapplication Factory and so forth theyget approved patterns and so once youhave those patterns approved then youcan start using them everywhere nowwe're using a lot of managed Services aswell so you'll see you know Cloud run weI love Cloud run Cloud run is awesomeit's managed kubernetes we're able todeploy uh containers on there easily butthe other services like Secrets managerlike artifact registry what we do is forevery cloud run server we have they eachget their own these are reallylightweight and once we have theterraform scripts to spin them up we caneasily spin them up so we can basicallytake this pattern and just start puttingit everywhere we want a server and I'mgoing to show you in the next wait Iwant to say one more thing you knowsorry manum what you also see then above there isour control plane so we have theseServices these patterns that we can usebut then they will reach out to ourcontrol plane and that's where we havethings like binary authorization sothat's where we are able to do we havesome centralized things that we're doingfor security as well so when you have anestablished pattern like this and thenif you go to the next slide you can takethat pattern and apply it everywhere sothis is now our architecture for a Mayotest drive this is our cognitive testingplatform you can see that we have thecloud run services in a whole lot ofdifferent places and what it's allowedus to do is I wouldn't call it microservices but it allows us to take eachof these Cloud rent servers and andbasically spin them up based on accessneeds who needs to do what with thatserver we can just easily spin up thispattern for each of these differentfeatures and then we can use things likeidentity where proxy and we have apattern for using that or we havesession based authentication if we havepeople that are outside a Mayo Clinicthat are using it so this results inonce we have this down asinfrastructures code with each of thesepatterns they become these buildingblocks and then we're just able to startlike fitting them in based upon our usecaseswell that that is awesome to be able tobe able to build these secure patternsand building blocks that are not onlyapplicable for this application todaybut potentially the future so inbuilding this it mentioned that youworked very closely with Google cloudand services so I'd love to hear thenanjay how was services in Google Cloudpart of this journey in helping MayoClinicwell wedesigned many IAC pipelines andterraform pipelines basically but Iwould like to highlight few of theimportant security controls that weimplemented uh because we we havesecurity requirements from your securityright so there are certain requirementswhere we wanted to enforce certainpolicies from the top down web and thatto implement that we need to have theorganization policies so if you see inthe diagram right we first designed ourorganization policies pipeline where weapplied certain policies we have over 50organization policies applied on the toplevel folder but I would like tohighlight how we designed everyeverything with just taking one exampleso if you see there we have oneorganization probably called run dotAllowed by binary authorization policiesso as it didn't mention like binaryauthorization I don't need to explainwhat it is so basically by that policyrighteach Cloud run under nav folder needs tohave binary authorization policy definedso by by that we have to we we decidedto design a central binary authorizationuh control plane where we we haveall the all the images that that areuploaded basically under products folderso on the products folder we have logsync which triggers the event when thereis any upload to the image in theartifact registry and then it scans theimage it triggers the event to theworkflow and which triggers the criticsigner which signs the image and thenonce it is signed only signed image willbe deployed to the cloud run so as as wewe have designed this Central binaryauthorization policy to support ourorganization policy because if we justdo the organization policy and binaryauthorization we give it to productsbasically you implement by anotherDirection then security can be a painright so we already defined Centralbinary authorizationcontrol basically by which all imageswill be sent if those meet the certainsecurity criteria next next thing islike basically we as as we see with thebinary authorization right like anyonewho has a permission to deploy the cloudrun deploy the image on the cloud runthat that person will be able to do thebreak the glass so we have to designIams very carefully so that uh no onecan deploy the image which is vulnerableright so so as to do that we have to dothe CI CD because as any if we give apermission to developers to deploy theycan do the break the glass and they canjust deploy the vulnerable image as wellso we we designed the cicd pipelinewhere we our Cloud build deploys theimage no developer has a permission todeploy the image but admins has apermission to deploy the image so thatwe can go on governance day binaryauthorization where we can if someonewants to deploy the vulnerable imagebecause of certain business requirementthat needs to have a justification andthat can be done by admin not bydevelopers so that way we we designedIIM pipelines basicallyand we defined I amwith respect to custom roles veryspecific custom roles we designed andassigned at the project level only for acertain groups soat the end basically security is layeredapproach right so we have a VPC servicecontrol around all the projects that wehave here and then on top of that likewe have a Beyond crop context serveraccess to securely give access to theusers who needs to have access to theenvironment and all this thing is donewith the terraform we we do not allowanyone to change the infrastructuredirectly on the you from the consoleeverything is in terraform certainthings like configuring IAP sorry uhyeah IAP concern screen is is not whatwe can do through the terraform so thereare certain things are allowed foradmins to do it but everything is interraform no one can change theinfrastructure through concern so thisis this is not just Foundation but thisis the platform for that applicationdevelopment back to you oh that isawesome and it's great to see thepartnership between services andpersonal services in being able toutilize the capabilities of both our IAMplatform binary authorization and VPCservice controls to be able to createthis secure microservices or securemicroservices pattern so John youmentioned that this is now somethingthat is reusable at Mayo have you beenable to quantify how much this is goingto Aid you in the future if you have toroll out additional applications oh yeahI mean again a year ago I didn't knowhow we were going to do this I I reallyjust wanted to get one thing up andrunning and be allowed to do it with Phiand now we have a platform where we'rethe the actual challenges now there's somany more things that we can do we'reactually getting a little ahead ofourselves because now we spin up thesenew products and integrate them veryvery quickly I mean I just want to justa shout out to Dana J2 in terms of whatthey were doing with and a shout out toterraform I mean the infrastructurescode made a lot of this also possibleand with the as Google Cloud keepsinnovating they keep making more andmore things automatic so that they'renot they don't have to be done in theconsole too that's one thing we've seenas far as things develop but like theyou guys were working like with one handbehind your back because they couldn'toperate in our environment so they hadto like write terraform Code test it intheir environments then hand it over tome where I could deploy it in myenvironment there's an awful lot ofscreen sharing going on in the earlydays but um but again it just was anenormous amount of like work thatoccurred between the teams is a verysmall number of teams basically at mostlike three or four of us at the timeyeah and so and that's part of the keyto what we're trying to we've puttogether with our security Foundation atGoogle Cloud whether your deploymentmodel is infrastructure modernizationwhether it's app modernization such asMayo Clinic did to roll out this newapplication platform whether it's dataanalytics AI we want to be able toprovide a baseline of capabilitiesterraform Blueprints and referencearchitecture guidance and additionalservices to be able to have apartnership to be able to advance yoursecurity posture and ultimately helpyour business agility so John can youtell me a little bit more what thefuture holds and what the futureDirection holds with mayo yeah so forour products now we've moved Beyonddeveloping our products already nowwe're working towards medical recordintegration direct medical integrationwe've also started down a path towardsgetting some of our products certifiedfor use outside of Mayo Clinic so we'reall well beyond sort of our roadmap ourroadmap again a year ago was just to geta product up and running but that's nowwe've got a whole ecosystem up andrunning so now we're looking to get thisstuff commercialized even outside ofmayo you know that that's awesome andthat's ultimate business agility fromnot knowing um trying to get out oneproduct in a year to be able to nowcommercialize and outside of mayo I meanthat that I'm glad that we've been ableto draw help drive that outcomeso awesome so next we're going to openthings up and be able to have some q afrom the audience I'll hand it over toAdrianthat was cool right maybe a hand forfriendsall right so um how do we get startedright how do I get this stuff like howdo I get this Wizardry that they'retalking about like I'm I want to getsome of this so so the first thing isum we have a set of we have a lot ofstuff to give out and and starting bygetting a good foundation so the basicswe have a really nice white paper thatis written by um a lot of very verysmart security folks or individuals hereat Google that you can get access to thesecurity Foundation web paper that talksabout a lot of things it's it's notagain it's not about just products ittalks about things like buildingOperations Security operations orincident response that that sort ofthingum next is let's talk about the theright security use case right or the theuse case we have as you know with Googleyou have a lot of support from youraccount teams for example they can helpyou figure out what type of use case areyou thinking but it will map outum you we're going to help you map thatthat out to what are the securityoutcomes that you want to get out ofit's one an outcome for example iscompliance right or we can talk aboutlike hey we care about like my Phi dataor some sort of things like that likewhat are what are yourum security goals and how can you mapthose out um directly the other and forthat we have a list of we have ablueprint we have a terraform script uhwe have a a repository that it's evergrowing and we're all we're creatingassets as we understand new security usecases based on our research and and workfor with other customers the last one isbest practices I don't know have youhave any of you been in our Cloudsecurity best practices Centerall right so there you goum our security best practices Center isjust that it's a it's an aggregation ofa lot of things um that are coming outfrom a security you can quicklyImplement in your environment as I saidsecurity AI right I know it's a HotTopic everybody wants to build a modelyou saw the keynote this morningeverything's about AI well here are someof the things and risks that weunderstand that are happening if youbuild AI capabilities in the cloud sohere's some of the best practices thatwe've seen so you you're not you knowcaught off guard or at least understandwhat what do you need to be doingum which is security AAA hereumthe the security AI workbench is is areally cool feature that I can all youcan also look intoum it can help you to that that is umwellthe AI workbench is is it's a tool thatyou can helpumincrement or accelerate your securityfunctions so far we've been talkingabout how can I secure or how can I runmy cloud securely the AI workbench it'sit's a tool that is you probably heardabout it and if not there's going to bea few sessions today that talk about howto use it and it uses SEC poem in someof our intelligence and it also helpsyou figure out how we as Google buildllms in in basically AI models to helpout answer quick questions aroundsecurity so for example this workbenchwill contain information from our threatIntel and then I can just very easilyask this type of models hey what are myuh what's can you tell me what are mycritical alerts in my high value assetswell this is what it's what the securityworkbench is going to help you so it's aslightly different from the talk tracktoday which is let me secure your Cloudbut the AI workbench is more gearedtowards the security specific functionsand last but not least we want to bewith you and try to help you throughoutyour entire you know a journey at Googleso the security and resilience frameworkwe created a we call it the solutionCenter which is a a number ofAssessments that you can make and it's afree tool that everybody can use you cananswer a few questions and we will beable to provide you with a a briefoverview of where some of the what's thematurity level based on your answerswhat's the security material Level thatwe assess against our best practices andrecommendations and and obviously wewill give you pointers to what is thenext step what do you need to do next toget to that either satisfy thatrequirement or increment my my maturitylevel to a higher level right we use wethink about industry benchmarks andthings like that so that QR code inthere you if you already scanned it isgoing to take you to that SolutionCenter we're constantly adding morestuff so you can leverage this platformagain it's it's free of of of costthere's no cost to itum but now I think um so far again justto to close out and before I move on toq a we want to make surewe want we want to be with you end toend we want to help you envision yourCloud workloads you work with youraccount teams on that we want to helpyou secure them and give yourecommendations to what's needed becausethere's nothing worse I've been workingin Cloud security for a while now andthere's nothing worse to be brought intoa conversation what I have to justify asecurity department that why are youguys thinking about putting a datawarehouse with pii data in the cloudwait a minute you know so we need tobacktrack and start you know buildingeverything from scratch and start youknow proving that the cloud is securewhat we're trying to do is to removethat we want to try to give you all thethe confidence that building your thatyou're building your your Cloudworkloads securely[Music]foreign"
