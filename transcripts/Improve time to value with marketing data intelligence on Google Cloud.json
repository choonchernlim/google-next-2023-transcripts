    "transcript": "foreign[Music]thank you everyone for for coming thismorning uh today we will be talkingabout how you can improve some of yourmarketing data intelligence and then howyou can actually use some of theseopportunities as different ways tounlock the power of Google Cloud usingsome different things around datamigrationsso uh my name is Jason Davenport I am adeveloper advocate here at Google so Ihave the opportunity and fund to workwith many different developers acrossall of our different customers andcommunities doing things like you knowbuilding migration stories working onmarketing data intelligence and allthose fun things with that I am joinedby dupes over here who will be coming onin a minute uh dupes is the chieftechnology officer at one of our I guesspartners and customers super metrics andso we'll be getting into their use casejust here in a little bitall rightmost companies when they're looking todo things like migrations or orum you really unlock the Innovation andvalue of their data you're using thingslike generative AIthere's this opportunity that presentsitself in terms of using platforms thatare fully scalable but what we have todo is make sure that when we'remigrating to these that we're doing in away that's both cost effective andactually helps us unlock that Innovationand scaleand most of the cases you know whenwe're doing these sorts of things whatwe're trying to really do is move pastsome of these different complexities andinto a space where we can actually buildInnovation and change for ourorganizationso with all these different things inmind as we're thinking about you knowhow do migrations unlock the value ofthings like marketing data if we thinkabout things like in Old platforms ortraditional systems where we can't scaleor where our data is in pressure in realtime these are really you know the thereasons or the impetuses why we thinkabout how we can do migrations but alsodo it in a way that's effective and andcost effective for thatso uh I think you know one of the thingsthat we've we've obviously been workingon a lot here at Google is how do weactually help organizations do thesesorts of things effectively but alsomake sure that they can you knowmodernize and innovate very quickly intothe stack for for their use cases andone of the ways that we do a lot of thatis actually using bigquery which isobviously our our big data platform butis is really driven to be a anInnovative product in terms of helpingyour Innovation as a customer or as adeveloper on Google and with that umjust a couple stats I think are fun wehad over a million projects created lastyear really helping marketers and otherfolks unlock the value of Google and allthe fun things that they doall rightall right I won't drain this slide herebut just uh quickly to cover you knowone of the things that we always do tryto do is take input from all of ourcustomers and and our developercommunities and many of the things hereare as a direct result of things that weheard from you in terms of you know Ihave data in another cloud or I haveunstructured data or I need to sharedata with all my customerswhat we've done here then is is we takethat input and we we build these intoproducts or feature sets to really tohelp you do more with your data and tounlock the value of that data whetherthat's commercially whether that's viayou know new products or new offeringsthat then you can share with yourcustomersum one fun example here if you thinkabout things like uh like data sharinganalytics Hub is one of our ways that wehelp marketers you know share data in asecure method with different customersbut then also be able to createsomething that's monetizable in terms ofof the data that you already haveall right so when we talk about allthese fun things right we come to how dowe actually migrate and what are the thedifferent ways to do that and do it atscale and effectively and dupes here isgoing to have the pleasure of talkingthrough uh his journey across all ofthese vectors here in a couple minutesfirst one if we think about you know howwe can move you know obviously there'sthere's lifting and re-hosting think ofthis as kind of the lift and shiftmethodthe next one is what we call lift andre-platform so how do we do things thatare are fast but also low risk you knowone of the things the migrations andI've done a number in a prior lifeum we always try to load all the riskonto the migration because we want toundo all the things that we did in thepast that were bad you know how do wetake an approach though where we canactually get it done effectively butthen re-platform uh once we we get overto that and then last is modernizationso think of that as you know how am Ijust building from scratch on Google andyou know maybe tearing down what I havehave existing for thatand a couple things that we've done inorder to really make your datamigrations and kind of that data storymore successful first one is is we'veintroduced some jumpstart Solutionsaround edw modernization so what thisreally means is that you were buildingtools to help you migrate faster andkind of bring our expertise as Googleand working with a number of differentorganizations in order to make that thatmore successful and to really make surethat you get off on a great foot withGoogle because one you know we want tomake sure that day one you're having agreat experience with our platformmigrations are always painful how do wemake that the least painful experiencefor you in itand another way that we we make surethat we have these things there and thesolution is how do we really bringthings like Automation and expertise youknow 2u as as companies who aremigrating uh over and maybe doing youknow new marketing things so with withthat in mind what are the the pieceshere that I'll quickly talk through ishow do we actually provide you moremigration services so in this case uhfor bigquery and we have a number ofthings for other products in the dataspace if you're looking to move maybe adatabasebut for bigquery one of the things thatwe now do is actually provide you SQLtranslation and soon to be even moreadvanced in terms of understanding SQLbasis intent to translate over to to newbigquery code and this is really basedon on input both from you and from someof our partners that you know find wecan do the data transfer but it's allthat code that I built up you knowhundreds of thousands of lines of SQLother places that's what takes me thetime it actually loads down my migrationwith with risk so Google how can youhelp us with this well that is that'swhy we've we've spent a lot of time andsome Acquisitions to help make thatprocess as painless as possible and tohelp you you obviously get get over andthen start to do the fun things as fastas possible with Googleuh here you can see a quick thing inactionumI highlighted on the left here if you'relooking at the screen uh all thedifferent things that we actually dooffer is a part of some of our servicesas well and these are you know justthings if you think about how do we helpde-risk uh are some cool things that wedo and then the other thing here that Iwill quickly uh call out you know one ofthe things that we always hear is uhdialects are very important in SQL youknow everyone says that they're antsySQL no one is actually ANSI sequelumso we try to make it easy to actually dothe ANSI SQL conversions across all theplatforms for youall right other one obviously datatransfer[Music]umyeah I think here if you think aboutmigrations the first time transfer isalways easy it's the incrementaltransfers that are hard we have toolsthat help you automate those processesand then last but not least if we cometo it you know really what we want totalk about here and and what we'll getinto is you know how do I then havethose opportunities to actually do thecool things in Google right so how do Iyou know use Google's best-in-classsecurity how am I able to actually bringall that AI together now how do I usegenerative AI you know in bigquery andall the fun things with it thenultimately get to a point where we canstart to build those insights and andoptimizations on top of itall rightfun things in Google overviews um butwhat I wanted to spend time here withand and have a dupes come on is talkingabout super metrics and how they'reessentially Cloud Journey has worked andthen how they're doing more with withGoogle cloud in terms of building theirown marketing Intelligence on top of itso with that dupes I'll let you take itaway fantastic welcome to the onlypresentation without AI in the title sohow boring is that are you gonna run outto the door nowumI really should have put AI in the titleuh we were talking about having like a avery dangerous shot game yesterdayduring the keynote if you if you heardAI you took a shot I think we'd have allbeen deadum but anywayuh my name is dupes and I'm very happyto have you here this morning I knowyou're all very very tired from lastnight's partying right right[Music]uh before I get started just a show ofhands because I want to tailor thepresentation to you because there'snothing worse than coming to apresentation at night in the morning andyou're like oh my God I don't care aboutany of this stuff so uh who has actuallydone a migration to gcp or any othercloudwho loved itthere's some people who loved it that'sfantasticum who would you do everything differentif they had their time backyeahum so uh I'm gonna go through first ofall what super metrics does because Ithink that's really important to get anidea of who we are and I think it givesyou an idea of our what we call ourmarketing intelligenceCloud sosuper metrics you know all that AI stuffyou kind of need data and we're one ofthe companies that helps you get thatdata to where you're going to actuallyput it into your gen III stack now butin the past it could be just I don'tknow some reports boring AIum yeah so we connect to about 120different data sources or more and fromthat you're going to transfer it throughus to uh wherever you need it so if inin Google that's Google bigquery LucaStudio Google Sheets but along the wayyou get to transform that clean it allup you own that dataand we we want you to derive insightseven as you're getting it through and ofcourse finally we want you to act onthat data that's really what supermetrics really is there for we want tomake your marketing much more efficientand uh our CEO and founder coasterfounder uh when he started this he wastrying to solve one very simple problemhe was trying to stop cut and pastingdata into Google Sheets well nowadays wewe transfer about 15 of the global uhadvertising spend digital advertisingspan which isum a lotum and we have a lot of big customerswho use us and some of the logos arethere but we also have small customersas well is anyone actually a customer ofsuper metrics by any chance hey come seeme afterwards I don't have any swagthough because I couldn't find any onthe way here but never mindum but you get to talk to us uh anywayso this is this is what we doand again this seems like a reallysimple problem we get data from oneplace we put data into anotherbut it doesn't scale that wayum so we are one billion customerrequests and growingum these are not like for like and itcan change all the time 135 plus billionuh data source requests emanating fromthose uh single customer requests thatcome in and this results in UStransforming the data to about 200billion rows of data in any given monthso that's uh kind of smallit it's funand enjoyableso wecame to a point in our existence and Iwill explain why and I am standing hereas the guy who's talking about this butin reality this took our entire companyin the end to douh Transformations and migrations arenot one person uh one person can sitthere on a stage and say we're going togo do this but it takes an entire teamto believe you and get behind it and andso I wouldn't be here before the amazingwork of our of our developer staff andour devops staff souh sowhy did we do thisumwhen I sewed up at the company in 2017we were 10 peopleand in those 10 people since then we arenow about 400 people so that's uh sixyears five years five and a half yearsof singular amount of growth you canimagine that when I showed up theservers we were running for serversfour serversand the exponential growth in the datathat we pulled and provided for ourcustomers along with the customer growthgrew and grew and grewand one of the things that we wanted todo was to solve more problems for ourcustomersandwe wanted our data to be processedwherever the customer wanted when youthink about a migration of your own datayou're doing it because someone comes toyou and says I want that data to bemigrated you don't wake up in the middleof the morning and say hey you know whatwould be great for our company we'regoing to go migrate the data does anyonewake up and say that no no uh so you'reforced to do it by your probably youryour person like me and and in our casewhat we wanted to do is to provide speedand reliability to our customers wewanted the data that was being processedfor our customers to be in the placethat we were delivering it to and for usthat was Googleand that helped when that we wanted toget our data as close to Google Sheetsas close to Luca studio and especiallyas close to bigquerywe wanted to give you the control as towhere you wanted to process it I am Iknow I'm at a Google conference but Ihave to say that most of us here areprobably hybrid cloud and one of thethings that most of our companies wantus to do is to be able to process andown that data where you want itand for us Google is important but wealso realize that there is another worldout there or many worlds out thereso what I said to our staff was uh youknow we really needed to get to a placewhere we're we're going to be very happyand and while we're solving problems forthe customers we also solve problems forus for our businessand I won't go through all of this Imean you wouldn't be sitting here in aGoogle Cloud conference if you didn'tlike Google Cloud uh if you don't likeGoogle Cloud conference and you're inthe wrong place and you're wonderingwhere the other cloud is that's probablythe bad thing to tell everybody now butwe um we we have scaled and we we movedinto Google cloud and we are very happywith the process that happened in theendso we're realizingrealistically a cost of 10 to 20 savingsthat's on top of everything else that wehad actually uh suggested we were goingto have so that's actually been verygood but one of the other reasons why wechose Google cloud and thank you verymuch for people like Jason who come onand help us is that you are verytransparent uh one of the few thingsthat excite me is when people tell mehow sucky something is on the cloud andwe can actually work around with it thereality is nothing's perfect and so it'sbeen a wonderful thing to have Googlework with us to get this done so reallygood communication and we're a big opensourceum open source uh Believers soand this is where everything kind ofwent wrong so we uh we said okay I saidwe're gonna do this and we're gonnawe're gonna put in a couple of rules ifwe're gonna do this we were primarilyhosted in one other cloudum it's a it's a big orange one and theuh the application infrastructure as Isaid uhwas built for four servers and we had tonow we'd already extrapolated to a largenumber of servers but we were nowthinking of becoming multi-homedmulti-regent multi-clustered multi-cloudand I gave one other instruction atwhich point everyone looked at me andsaid you're crazy you're insane whichwas because we transfer this much datafor our customers and our customers arethe most important thing we have I saidwe have to do this in real time withouta single downtimewe had to do this without anyone knowingI'm very happy to say that this actuallyworked not without some trials andtribulations but it did worksowe approached this process we firsttried to do with the lift and lift andwhat did you call it a lifting lift andshift lift and shift uh that was not agood ideauh we tried uh so I've done a lift andshift before in another company and itinvolved a lot of downtime and a lot ofpain because you don't really knowwhat's actually going to happenand so once you move to a cloud youactually or or on-prem or whatever thethe situation is that's when youactually realize where all the thebottlenecks the problems actually areso what we decide to do is to do amethodology from the games industryactually from massively multiplayergames and so the idea is if you'replaying inside of of uh World ofWarcraft you're going to play in asingle Geo uh but your yourauthentication systems and everythingelse might be in a central location andfor us when we're transferring your dataand when you're thinking abouttransferring your data to bigquery orfrom wherever you're going to bethinking about what exactly do I need totransferand and process for your customers andin these days of data sovereignty thisis a big deal so weum we went with the idea that weactually needed to process your datauh when the request comes in and thatall of that need to be in a regionalcluster but the actual systems thatcontrolled that didn't need to be and sothis is the process that we went withand one of the really uh good thingsabout this has anyone used this processbefore for a migration or anything likethatis this new is this interestingokay I hope so uh so so and I'll explainwhat we did and this can be applied toalmost any database migration and anyany application migration and we do thisnow for all of our changes to oursystems actually we use this kind ofmethodology to do it and it worksremarkably well it does however requirea lot of planning and so what itactually gives you is the ability tohave complete data control of whereeverything is actually going to beso you know where a query is going to beprocessed you know exactly what kind ofdata is going to be givenbut the application needs to understandand how to communicate with each clusterwhere who is actually going to do theprocessing how is it actually going tobe done what databases does it need tohitand once you actually get it done youactually have incredible outageresilience because in real time nowtoday we can actually move a customerfrom gcp to another cloud gcpin Europe to gcp and us or whichever ifa customer really wants their own cloudwe can actually do that as welland because of that of course we getmuch better testingso this is this is the process by whichwe we went uh to do thissoif you want to think about data and datamigrations one of the waysum I love analogies and I love thinkingabout things in real world terms so ifyou're actually looking at data and dataflowing into the hands of your customersif you can imagine a river flowing allthe way like a big river and thensuddenly you get a huge rainstorm or ahurricane and there's a flood surge andone of the things ways that you canactually prevent the flood fromdestroying you is to actually create abypass for the river a floodway and bydoing that you can actually take some ofthe water and transfer it around sothat's basically a data migration now ifyou take that simple analogy and yousaid okay what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to do a lift and what did you callit again lift and shiftand break uh if you if you transfer thewhole river over to a floodway andyou've never done that before chancesare good you're going to find places inthat River where it's just going to blowthe banks because you've never done thatbeforeand one of the most amazing things ofdoing this kind of process where you areable to control the sluice gate of thewater transfer of the transfer of thedata you know if you have let's saymultiple bigquery tables and you'rewriting a few things and then writingmany things uh or or a mySQL database ora postgres or any of these things youcan actually fix those indexes fix thoseproblems as you go through fix the costand sowehad to overcome many problems in doingthis and one of them was we had to getout of our ownproblems of Technology debt that we hadactually created and put ourselves intowe had to adopt microservices in a waythat we could allow for those loosegates to happen to actually move thedata to the right places as we needed toand then we also needed consistency andthis is where we discovered that cloudsare not equal no matter what anyonewould like to tell you uh Google or anyother clouds will tell you our databasescales Xand it really doesbut it does not scale acts exactly thesame as X in the other Cloud there maybe iops that are different maybe otherthings that are different and one of theways that we had to actually deal withthis situation was and moving to gcp wasactually to use a vendor by the name ofIvanwho helped us actually put the databasesin a way we can now today turn ourdatabases within a few seconds where ourentire primary database will switch acloudthat's a really amazing thing for us tobe able to do as a devops person as a asa CTO who's worried about theircustomers and and what happens I canbasically say hey it's okay we canactually do this today it's greatmy CEOs are very happy about this I hopethey're sitting there somewhere soumand and and this brings up the lastquestion with this the uh the cloudspecific tools you really need to knowexactly what you're going to be gettinginto when you do thisso there's not much more and I can gointo a lot more about data migrationsand stuff by questions and things likethat one of the things that we had tolearn really quickly is we stoppedpulling this a migration migration isactually a four letter word nowI think and instead we have to callourselves a multi-cloud hybrid Cloudthinking and you really have to you'rebasically going from being a singleCloud vendor to think in a multi-homedmulti-multi cloud way and and itrequires all the developers all of theapplication even our customers supportpeople and customer success we had tobuild tools to be able to show them heyyou know this query is running in JCP uhbefore we could actually move anythingso uh you have to think about it in thatway if you're going to do it it makes itvery very very easy as an organizationonce you start thinking in the right wayand by the way we tried this first andwe got it wrong we did we we tried likeI said lifton and and move and we weeven tried a version of this and itdidn't work uh someone just asked me youknow how long last night at a Google atGoogle or asked me so how long did itactually take and I know our Google repswere wondering exactly when it was goingto happen but when it did it happenedreally fast and that's because weplanned and we tested and we testedend-to-end things all the timeum little things would this system workexactly the same would this actuallyscale to the right thinglet's move you know a dummy data dummycustomer anything like that and it tooka while for us to get all the littlethings done so we did a lot of end-tantestingandum but once so that was about a year anda half of planning testing and gettingIvan ready and all of the other thingsready and then I'm pleased to say thatwe started in March and we are over 60of our our traffic is now over to gcpand I don't think a single customer hasknown that we've actually done thatwhich is uh which is fantasticso these are some of the learnings and Ican go into anything you want in detailso yes it took it was a lot harder inplanning and a lot easier in executionthan we manage and the end result isexceeds our expectations well thank youeveryone for uh coming here uh on firstsession of the morning and I hope youall have a great rest of your Wednesdayhere at next for all the fun sessionsand and things out please stop by the uhThe Hive in the in the Expo Booth too tosee all the fun things thereforeign"
