    "transcript": "[Music]hope you have been having a great day sofar and hope you're enjoying all thenext sessions that we have organized foryou my name is pranav Nar I'm a directorof product management on Google cloudand I would like to welcome all of youto this session on digitaltransformation with Google'sdatabases in this session I'm alsojoined by two Tech leaders from theindustry we have sudhir Kumar Redi whois a senior principal architect at flipcart one of India's largest e-commercecompanies we also have yein Chopra whois a senior manager at Deo one of gcpstopPartners so between the three of uswe're going to bring in three differentperspectiv Ives to this session I'mgoing to talk about the product andbusiness side of things sudhir is goingto talk about it from the customer sideand Yin is going to talk about it fromthe partner side and I'm hoping thatbetween these three perspectives you'llhave a very insightful session hopefullyyou'll get new Inspirations new ideas asyou think about digitaltransformation so without further Adolet's get going as I said we would liketo organize the session into three partsI'll start off with the discussion ondigital transformation and also give youa peek into some of our top innovationsthat we have announced atnext uh we will then have sudhir who'sgoing to talk about flip cart's digitaltransformation journey and then Yin isgoing to talk about their partnershipwith Kroger and what they did aroundassociate productivity with digitaltransformation okay so without furtherdelay let's Dive Right In into the firstsection on digitaltransformation I wanted to start offwith a very thought-provoking questionwhich I'm sure all of us have asked atsome time or the other and the questionis are you set up forInnovation let's face it in today'sworld digital innovators are disruptingthe traditional players the bar oncustomer experience is Raising every dayin fact with Technologies like gen it'sgoing to expand even further and forevery company to stay relevant ininovation is key and to drive Innovationyou need a foundation of good technologyand goodarchitecture which is where digitaltransformation becomes soimportant so in fact according toIDC in2025 about $2.8 trillion is going to beinvested globally by companies ondigital transformation that kind ofshows the importance companies aregiving to digital transformation in factlet me show you another interesting stathere's a Google Trends report on digitaltransformation and as you can see it'sbe see been seeing a you know bit of aspike in the past couple of years asreference point if you compare it withthe big data wave that started in2010 you can clearly see that there's anew wave now with the digitaltransformation also with Technologieslike gen data cloud and pieces like thata few of which I'll touch upon webelieve this new wave of digitaltransformation is going to be muchbigger than the Big Data wave that wehave seen sofar so what's the big deal about digitaltransformation frankly digitaltransformation is around all aroundtransformation for yourcompany you can no longer beunidimensional as a company in thisworld you'll have to not only look atCost reduction productivity Improvementuh you know C customer retention scalereliability trust sustainability you'llhave to look at all these Dimensionstogether and that's where yourtechnology Investments are going to beextremelycritical in fact none of thesechallenges that you see here on theslide here are anything new I'm sure allcompanies have been dealing with day inand day out for years but the differenceright now is it's looking at all aroundtransformation but there's one uniquefactor and that factor is you need toFuture proof your applications fordigitaltransformation let me give you a simpleexample let's say you're a gamingcompany youve built a game you thinkit's going to be a good game you haveactually set it up such that it canscale to tens of thousands ofusers but what if you were an overnightsuccess and you actually saw hundreds ofthousands if not millions of users whatif your technology could not scale todeliver a good user experiencedo you think you'll be able to retainthis user base again do you think you'llbe able to win back this lostopportunity it's less likely in thisworld because the bar and theexpectation that customers have isevolving and it's a very high bar thesedays so that's where future proofing isso important and when you talk aboutyour technology stack the most corecomponent of the stack is your datamanagement clear that's because data iswhere you insights lie data is where youcan innovate data is where you have thepieces that can help you build betterexperiences so the big question weshould ask is how should we future proofour data management layer or ourdatabases perse let me give you another example I'msure all of you use digital bankingthese days you know you have your mobileapp you try to use banking transactionson the app how would you feel if you getthe dreaded message we are undergoingmaintenance right now sorry please tryagain laterI'm pretty sure you would not want touse the app again you might startthinking about other options that youwant to exercise that's the world welive in the nature of applications havechanged the expectations have changed soyou need a database layer that canactually scale to your requirements thatcan be always on you know there's noconcept of Maintenance downtime anymoreI know companies today they try to findyou know low traffic durations weekendsEtc to do some level of Maintenance butif people face a downtime somethingcritical is going to happen they'regoing to lose trust you also need yourdata management layer to actually beextremely elastic so it can deal withups and downs in your traffic you needto be price performant secure andcompliant now all these challenges allthese aspects easier said than done it'sdifficult to get all these together andthat's the same challenge Google facedin fact all through Google's EvolutionGoogle had to rethink data management wehad to reinvent the concept of databasesas such today we have three differentServices which kind of power almost allof Google's applications and theseapplications cater to billions of usersworldwide so what are theseServices first and foremost we have bigtable which is our key value databasewhich is extremely suited for largescale low latency High throughputapplications it's useful for iot it'suseful for ad click tracking it's evenuseful as a feature store for your aimapplications the next one is spannerwhich is kind of a hybrid betweenrelational and non-relational databasesspanner offers you the adet capabilitiesthe SQL capabilities of a relationaldatabase it also offers you the scaleand reliability of a non-relationaldatabase so you get the mix of both andso spanner offers you a very versatileexperience and it's useful for a numberof use cases including Financialtransactions inventory management gamingand so on the next one is fire storewhich is our serverless documentdatabase built on top of spanner so firestore not only gives you all the goodiesthat spanner offers it also offers youbackend as a service so with fir storeyou no longer need to deal with middletiers you can directly invoke thedatabase from your clients in fact firstore also gives you offline onlinemodes it gives you realtime synccapabilities across clients making itextremely suited for mobile and web kindofscenarios but internally all theseapplications power you the Googleapplications are powered by theseservices and so we're continuouslytrying to innovate we're trying toinnovate by repeatedly raising the tableStakes so these services offer you fivenines of availability which is industryleading there's no concept ofMaintenance downtime so you don't haveto bother finding low traffic situationsor weekends for these Services Googletakes care of it for you you don't haveto even bother about it these servicesoffer you really high levels of uh uhavailability they also offer you reallyhigh levels of fall tolerance it alsooffers you automatic partitioning so bythat way you can actually you don't haveto handle manual partitioning andsharding of your data because it takescare of the scale for you pretty much asyou need pretty much unlimited scale isavailable for you in addition to thatthere's a good experience around Globalreplication it's not something new fordatabases but when you actually enterfalse scenarios how do you recover howdo you fail over it's a fully fullymanage experience for you Google takescare of those complexities for you lastbut not the least it also offers yougreat price performance and security andcompliance so if you haven't alreadythis these are some services that youwould want to check out uh and we arecontinuously investing and innovating inthese Services all through and with thatlet me switch over to actually talkabout some of our latestInnovations the lot of features that we'have announced at next for some of thesebut I'm going to touch upon two keythemes data cloud andl and I'm going tohandpick just a few of these Innovationswhich I think are going to be veryimpactful for digitaltransformation let's start with thefirst one I'm really excited to sharewith you that we are announcing theavailability of cloud spanner data boostin GA right now data boost is ourtransformative technology that actuallyenables you to run analytics on youroperational workloads with hardly anyimpact on your transactionalapplications so how does it actuallywork as you might know all our databaseservices that I just mentioned here havea segregated compute and storagearchitecture so storage actually sets ona distributed service called Colossus infact Colossus is the same service thatpowers big query andGCS so when you provision spannerresources and when you make a queryspanner actually processes the queriesand then interfaces with Colossus toactually process your data with databoost you get a parallel isolatedChannel which scales on demand and candirectly process the data in Colossuswithout affecting your spannerinstances so you might be wondering okaythat's great you know it gives you greatlevels of isolation maybe it's a uniquedesign but so what well what if I toldyou data boost is your key to trulyenabling data sharing in yourorganizationit's your key to actually get datademocratization in your organization letme explain in the traditional world youhave a bunch of teams each having theirown databases I'm sure all of you aredealing with that what if you have ateam of analysts who want to access thatdata and derive insights from that dataso to get access to it and actuallyfigure out how they can utilize the datathey have to get into this negotiationand contract building with the databaseowner the database owner has to figureout how much to scale how how can youbuild in isolations how can you haveenough throttling mechanisms so thebusiness critical workloads are notimpacted with your analyst making somemassive queries to your database nowjust think if every team has to makethese negotiations with each other toaccess the data then how combersomewould it be this is not a future proofworld this is actually taking you backso data boost changes his equationcompletely so with datab Boost as adatabase owner you are just enablingaccess to spanner for let's say aspecific role like say an analyst roleand giving them access VI are data boostso if you have analysts who wants toquery spanner they can just come overand make their queries they pay for thecapacity that they use datab boost willautomatically scale as much as neededand then it's going to query andinterface with Colossus get the datawithout affecting your transactionalworkloads so this is the era of truedata democratization a world where datasharing becomes extreme seamless as Itold you earlier data is where theinsights lie and data is how you caninnovate so this is going to be verycrucial but I'm not done yet data boostcan also enable you up to 100x moreperformant queries for specific queriesbecause you have got a dedicated Fleetthat's actually provisioned on the flyto handle those queries it can even helpyou with cost reduction because you'renot duplicating your data you're nothaving to over provision for some ofthese analytical queries and otheraccess patterns it also simplifiesgovernance because in the end you havejust one copy of yourdata okay so with that let me touch uponthe other piece so fine you know databoost is a great mechanism for you toquery the data spark big query whateverscenarios that you have but what if youreally need to replicate the data that'swhere we have chainstreams spanner big table and fire storeall integrate ability to realtime streamchanges to Downstream systems like bigquery so essentially we have a bunch ofinbuilt connectors which makes this veryeasy for you in fact you could go onestep further and you could even buildevent driven programming by listeningfor specific changes in your uh uh youknow database updates and then takingactionsaccordingly so now chain streams anddata boost both enable you to consumecontent from thedatabases what if you had to do it in areverseDirection that's where reverse ETL comesin I'm really excited to share with youthat we've got two mechanisms here onfirestore we have fir store extensionsthat helps you schedule jobs which canmaterialize data from Big query tofirestore and on big table we are nowannouncing in preview ability to exportdata from Big query to big table so nolonger do you need any ETL pipelines forthis you can pretty much just with a fewclicks get get the data exported to bigtable and as you all know datawarehouses are not best at servingtraffic you need reliable High scale lowlatency databases to accomplish that andthat's what reverse ETL capabilitieshere will do so it's essentially likethe world where you had wires and youhad to connect everything and now it'skind of a plug-in play world where youcan just click a few buttons and it'lltake care of things for you so and trustme we're just getting started here we'regoing to expand on many of these databoost is Al going to come over to bigtable and other services it's all goingto expand to all the other services thatwehave with that let me switch over to theother uh pattern which isAIML I'm happy to share with you that wenow have spanner integration with WX aaiuh in GA so this actually provides yourealtime intelligence capabilities soyou could essentially invoke a model forpredictions in real time in the contextof your transaction so if you're doing acredit card transaction you can validateif it's a fraud and in the SQL contextitself you could block it or you couldactually continue with it in fact we arealso further going to extend this tollms large language models so you canactually build your generative AIapplications with spanner and interfacewith llms u you know and get the resultsVI within the spanner context itself sothat's comingshortly I'm not done yet so I'm reallyhappy to share with you that we are alsoannouncing spanner studio in previewspanner studio is like a One-Stop shopto query visualize and anal you knowevaluate the data that you have inspanner what's more with dit AI inspanner we are actually enabling you togenerate SQL statements with just simplecomments this is really cool uh you knowI didn't have the time for a demo butgenerally you should go and try it outyou can just provide a comment for it tocreate a table for specific entitiesit'll even create the SE for you it caneven add data into your tables if youwant to test things out or have somesample data added it'll create the SQLfor you you know right away just bysimple comments and it'll take care ofit for you so we believe this going todrastically improve the efficiency foruh you know all the developers here andagain we're just getting started there'sa lot more coming down the lane soyou'll see this going further andfurther and hopefully this going totransform things evenfurther well I'm not done yet so I'mreally excited to also share with youthat we have got a bunch of AIMLextensions for fir store available foryou we've got extensions for textenrichment like checking text toxicityor text summarization we got extensionsfor IM uh you know media enrichment likeimage comparison for similarity orspeech to text conversions we also haveextensions for interactive AI likechatbots so you could actually buildchatbots or chat applications with ewith the power of Vex Ai and Fir storecombined so I can keep going the themore announcements here but in theinterest of time I'm going to stop hereuh let me hand over the stage to sudhirhe's going to talk to you about Flipkartand its journey in the digitaltransformation space over to yousudhir thanksbrov hello everyone it's a pleasure tobe here uh I'm happy to share with youFlipkart uh how we have modernized thedata platform architecture on top of gcpand we'll talk about how a real-timeplatform is helping us solve some of thekey business decisions to be madeinstantly Flipkart is the largeste-commerce company in India Walmart isone of our largest investor in the last16 years flipcart has increased adoptionof e-commerce in India today we havemore than onethird of Indians shoppingonline on us if you imagine thepopulation of entire Los Angeles that isthe number of firsttime users who wereon flip card last year for few days ofsale right on the largest sale that wehave is Big billion Day Sale which isequivalent to your Black Friday salewhich we have here um in the last salethe first minute or first few second thefirst second of the sale the entirepopulation of San Francisco and sanoscombined were trying to enter flip cardthe same time that's the scale that wetalking about and what does it take torun the infrastructure at this scale wehave millions of CES we hundreds of gpuswe have exabytes of storage and we havehundreds of gbps of internet connectionto solve the needs right and how do werun this we are in a hybrid mode we havetwo of our private data centers which werun on Prem with with our own team andthen we have two of our uh regionsrunning on gcp in India regions and thereason we have chosen this is e-commercebeing a bursty business where we have alot of peak traffic at times it makessense for us to work with Google publiccloud provider to use on demandinfrastructure and it has helped us alot our data platform is primar locatedon GoogleCloud so the scale of the data platformif you see we have more than 2,500 feedsof different types of events which wecapture from the application with mobileapplication as well as the serviceswhich run on Flipkart and all of theminj just close to 700 terabytes of datain a day right and we have more than 130billion messages that we inest in a dayif you look at the overall size of thedata platform we have 80 plus pedabytesof storage and we process on a dailybasis 15 plus pedabytes of data acrossmultiple 8,000 odd pipelines right anduh the volume of this is equivalent to 4billion close to 4 billion photos highdefinition photos being processed in aday right coming to the real-timeplatform uh we have 900 plusapplications running in uh on on theservices and we they process more than 2petabytes a dayand we have more than a million messagesbeing processed per secondright so what does the platform looklike right this is a very simplifiedversion of the platform uh so if you seeat at a primary uh bottom layer we havethe injection layer we have inje wheresome of the systems ingest in batch modewhere they are not able to do it andmost of the systems ingest in realtimemode within few seconds of theactivities on end user devices or theservices servers which run all of thatdata gets into the data platform fromthere it enters to a messaging queue andfrom there the real-time platformconsumes it and serves critical businessuse cases for end users which arebusiness users or developers or analystswho wants to look at the data or theyeven get into the serving systems for uhoptimizations CTR predictions and othersystems are there right and then there'sa whole uh data which comes in we storeit as it is uh for batch consumptionthen we have close to 9,000 oddpipelines which run different types ofworkloads on top of it right one sparkmap reduce and other workloads to dodifferent type of analytics on top of itand serve that to different systems viareports or adog queryanalysis or even export to their ownsystems right oh sorry just to add tothat we also have data quality uh onthis in the platform we have metadataand then we have Knowledge Graph theseare all some things which have investedon Prem overtime so on Prem we were runningprimarily on the Hadoop text track wehad Hadoop hdfs Yan uh Edge Bas verticaKafka and all of these elastic sege Textracks when we looked at modernizing itwith gcp we picked some of the bestofferings from them we've looked at pupsup big table dataproc uh GCS all of these and we foundthat doing the right mix of what we haveinvested over time versus is what Googlehas invested over time what is the bestcombination of it to leverage for uspurpose and we have picked it up in amode that uh we can run the dataplatform at scale for handling big blendday sale right and we had given the sizeof the data we have 80 pedabytes of datawe were we did a migration in 6 monthsthe entire data onto gcp and were ableto run all of the 10,000 oddpipelines as on gcp and without having adowntime we did a seamless migrationwithin a very short time of 6 monthsand all of it was able to be achievedbecause of the kind of uh stable systemsthat we have on Google cloud and theInvestments that we have done at ourend right coming to realtime systemsright uh what are the use cases that wehave today in the in in in our companyright so the moment user is active onthe app flip cart app within singledigit seconds we get the entire funnelright from how many unique visits arehappening right now on flip cart to tohow many users are actually browsing theproduct po Pages which category of pagesare they browsing to how many productsare being checked out to the entireorders being placed the entire funnel ofit we today computed in single digitseconds of the activity on the userdevice right lot of use cases on CDRpredictions for the search to optimizethe algorithms for better ranking uhthere are use cases where theadvertising systems take it forimproving what which ads are more uhmore likely to be clicked on right sothere are lot of these fraud detectionuse cases a lot of uh Finance wants aview of saying how is the business doingright now they want to understand howwhat categories are working well what isnot working well uh what is the profitand loss for each of these verticals alot of these use cases which they wantdata in near real time and all of theseare being powered by ourplatform so over the years we haveinvested in a platform internally calledas fstream uh this is equivalent to theGoogle beam if you're aware uh this isan abstraction built layer um underneathwe have Apache spark and Flink uh and wehave built abstractions specifically forour business use cases where uh there isrepeated code which most of thepipelines have it we try to abstract itout in a easier way so the developer Liwrites less number of codes for hispurpose um so most of the stuff like uhwe do is there are multiple pipelineslike there's a order Pipeline andthere's a cancellation Pipeline andthere is a category pipelines which comein right most of these are differentsystems in the company and then how doyou combine all of that into a singlemetric that people are interested in andthat to near real time right so we haveinvested in scaling these systemsbuilding these abstractions over theyears um and the key requirements forthese are highly durable reliable and uhscalable right so this is the key USBthat we have built over years and howdoes the system look like if you look athigh level design it basically this is avery simplified version of it so if yousee there are users doingactivities and there is a web servicewhich captures all of that data andinest into uh the pubsub and from pubsubwe consume it by our pipelines and thenwe Pump It data into big query and bigtable and then we have reports on top ofbig query this is very simplifiedversion of it underneath I'll give youan example of a use case today if youwere to compute uh how what is a CDprediction for the pipelines right forsearch so you will have search viewscoming in VI one pipeline you will havesearch clicks coming in VI anotherpipeline you'll have the category of theproduct like which category what is a ametadata Associated to the categorycoming in from other product so all ofthose are handled by the F steam layerwith just declarative code for theapplication developers or a SQL code andall of this computes in near real timeand pushes it into these stores on Premwe were primarily running this on Kafkathis layerand our own Edge Bas setup clusters overhere and we had elastic search andvertica here when we mve to gcp wemodernized this by replacing it withpubsub big table and big query andlooker so what are the benefitsassociated with this right big table isamazingly scalable right we today runbig table cluster with 1400 plus nodesuh today the kind of operations we do isequivalent to reading a 4K HD movie withevery second that's the kind of scale weuse H table uh big tablefor right so it's it's it's actuallyworking out really well for us rightEdge Bas had a lot of issues operationalissues for us a lot of hours used to bespent by the developers in ensuring thestability of the system in fixingday-to-day issues and they were notfocusing on the platform capabilities orthe data products on top of it so bymoving to big table all of that Ops overit has gone away for us it's become veryeasy for us right and it has led tofewer incidents fewer outages and uhapproximately 10% of the up down timeswhich were caused previously with Edgebase and other self-managed TCH stacksand all have gone right Edge table uhbig big table is cost effective for usright it has an amazing order scalefunctionality right now for big billionday kind of sale we have huge amount ofusers which coming in but not in a baauin in in a regular day right so how doyou handle that kind of scale so bigtable all we have to do is have a andMax configured and the systemsautomatically scale up and scale downright and help us save the cost so we'veseen upwards of 20% cost reduction insome of these pipelines right and and uhgiven the size of scale we need requiredfor big billion Day Sale we have seen itworking really nice without having anyissues and it's been really well for usright and the most interesting thing forus was the open source compatibilitybecause we previously running on edgeBas and Edge Bas a compatible API worksas it is on to a big table we didn'thave to do do any code changes all ofmore 9 900 odd pipelines seamlessly runon this so overall it's very easy for usto migrate and set up and run it onGooglecloud and this gives you out of the boxbusiness continuity plan where you canset it up in multiple regions given thekind of requirements we have our ourbusiness users want to look right nowwhat is happening during a big billionday kind of a sale right so we can'tafford a single minute of downtime ofthe Pipelines so at these kind of saleswe run it in two of the regions inparallel big table replication happensout of the box pubs up replicationhappens out of the box we have pipelinesdeployed in both the regions to computeand we have reporting dashboardingSolutions where we built a BCB lot ofthese Solutions were very simplified byusing this plug- and play buildingblocks and we were focusing more on thehigh level abstraction and uh productson top of the core infrastructure whichwas provided out of the box forus right overall I would say big tablehas been a big powerful tool for us inscaling up our systems and helping usrun the sale at where we are today andwe are hoping this year it'll be largerthan the last year sale and hoping thatthings go smooth right so this I'll handover touh he'll continue on this thank you allI hope this was[Applause]useful hello hello okay thanks sudir uhgood afternoon everybody uh my name isyatin Chopra I'm part of deo's AI anddata practice and I spent most of mycareer serving retailers um helping themmaximize value out of the data assets byBuilding Solutions which generateinsights and insights whichDrive operational excellence byimproving associate experience which iswhat we'll talk about here in a secondand then also insights which actuallyhelp in customer retention as well asacquisitionum deoy and and and gcp have had a verystrong and growing relationship uh justyesterday uh we were recognized forpartner of the year in 2023 for fourdifferent categories um and we areshowing up as one team uh acrossmultiple strategicaccounts as a backdrop the last 10 yearsor so has been spent uh reallydigitizing or improving the consumerexperienceum it was not until I would say uh asthe pandemic began that you know therewas a a light shed on what about theassociate so for for retailers who havelarge physical store presence right theyand facing you know Talent shortages andother things what would and the lack ofuh digitization it was pretty uh I wouldsay slammed on opportunity to startautomating and digitizing the day-to-dayworking of an associate because a greatassociate experience directly influencesan amazing consumerexperience with thatsaid Kroger as a retailer um expansivephysical presence uh more than 2800stores uh fun fact I found out earlier Ithink last week um they were thelargest Sushi seller in 2022 uh whowould have known 40 million pieces ofsushi soldum but you know the challenges here wasthey have more than 400,000 Associatesand actually they have made I would sayin The Last 5 Years very strategic betson improving the associate experienceand one such was called associateproductivity which is what I'll talkaboutnext what we built here on cloud I meanobviously uh gcp uh Native Google andand deloid showed up as one uh we builta smart data platform which which Powerstwo applications application one whichis the tasking application which is youknow it pushes um in in the consumerspeak we say next best offer but thinkof next best action for an associate todo so imagine the power of having umdata and insights on in your in yourhand and I actually haveU uh the app in my mobile phone so I candemo it later uh at our booth at deoebut pushes what we should be doing nextbased on events happening in the storeand then the second application wasstore audit which is just making surethat you know what was previously onlyregistered on paper has been digitizedto make sure that all the processes arehappening uh as they were planned for orstanding operatingprocedures like any good consulting firmuh you know we have a framework ofselecting databases so when we startedputting pieces together uh to build thearchitecture this is now summer of2021 um we you know we actually starteduh to prove out the hypothesis that ifwe actually empowered and associate withwhat they should be doing next that wecan actually move the needle and makethem more productive in their day-to-dayjobs so we started actually withpostgress or Cloud SQL and we startedwith three stores with the PC went wellover a 10e period um and then using thesame architecture we moved up to 25stores it wasn't actually until when wehit 100 stores and the data we wereflowing in that we realized we weregoing to start missing very specific SLAis required and also the experience theassociat was having it's it's then iswhen we decided that you know uh we moveover and parallel track to spanner uhwhich delivered a fit across the boardand as U PR of also pointed out right umI think the key here was um we I wouldyou know we delayed scaling past 100Stores um as we caught up and rearchitected and putting spanner as thebackbone of our architecture and then umyou know 500 stores at a time is when wehave scaled and we've been now live atmore than 2400 stores for the last yearuh bolted on many more capabilities anduse cases and tasks and things are goingwell um quick look at the deploymentarchitecture you know we are ingestingdata from on Prem multiple sourceswhether as HR Trucking logic whateversignals are happening in the store umthey all are stitched together andstored in the spard database and eachapplication underlying store is also aspanner um the data science layer whichis where the magic happens in terms ofpriorization and task creation that'swhat pushes out to the mobile phones andthen as Associates are actually using umand and doing their day-to-day jobs thatfeedback is loop back in and thoseevents then trigger the next set ofactions what we are today um over thelast 18 months we've built a centraltasking applicationum and we have just recently over thesummer also so today what we've done sofar was be able to prioritize and um dothe next best action for associateswithin a department but then whathappens if you have excess labor onanother department and not enough workto do on the other one where we've beenable to prove the hypothesis that if Ineeded help in Bakery and there wasactually more tasks to be done andsomebody didn't show up but there wasanother associate with train and theskills available in a differentDepartment how do I guide that associateto do that task so we call it directeduh work for that also has Improvementwhich will be put into place you knowlater this year um again the Mantrabeing right associate right task at therighttime um with this client a lot of paperbased processes now have been digitizedso we've collected a lot of data overthe last year which are now going tohelp us do more labor recommendationsscheduling recommendations and evenDynamic walks and tasking which isbasically helping them put potentiallyyou know pivot away from processesthey've been following uh within thestore for retail Ops over the last 10 or15 years and then finally the visionobviously in the next couple years is uhfully connected store and this is a verycomplimentary platform in thesystem with that as I hand it over backover to perov I would say that you knowwe showed up as one team which iswhether it's deloid Kroger um and Googleum obviously spanner um was critical tothe success and the scale we needed toachieve and we're extremely excitedabout how we unpack we have a road mapof capabilities going in fy4 where wewill be unpacking um data boost is whatpram had said and then vertex AI soputting in the data science of the AImodels inplay FR of I'll hand it back over toyou thank you yatan so thank you yatanand Sadir for sharing some reallyvaluable insightsuh I hope this was very useful for youdefinitely we try to capture differentperspectives uh in the end there are fewpatterns that you might see emergingfrom all these three different flavorsof discussions one is around how data isbeing handled there's a t now there's afocus around bringing data togetherbreaking down the silos so you can havebetter insights sudhir talked aboutrealtime insights because that's wherethe differentiation is if you rememberearlier when I started I asked with thequestion are you all set for Innovationthat's the place where you couldactually make a difference by actuallygoing more real time versus somethingthat's postevent right in this world inthe end it boils down to the kind oftechnology that you can pick up on Igave you a brief overview a very highlevel overview of some of thesetechnology pieces that we have beeninvesting in some of the announcementsthat we shared but if you are interestedwe definitely have some dedicatedsessionspecific deep dive sessions that willactually go deeper into many of thesetopics whether it's spanner big tablefire store some of our geni piecesplease check them out that'll be veryinformative for all of you is what Ibelieve and last but not the leastplease do take the time to provide usfeedback I know digital transformationis not an easy Journey I've had a lot
