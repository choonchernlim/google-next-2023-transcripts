Oracle workloads withGoogle Cloud we'll go over how you canlift and shift your Oracle workloads tothe bare metal solution and then we'lltalk about a lot of the new capabilitiesin Cloud SQL for SQL Server that make iteasier than ever for you to migrate yourworkloads and take advantage of all ofthese built-in capabilities around Highavailability data protection andsecurity all while making sure that youknow you're getting the value that youneed for what you're payingthere we go wrong directionum my name is Isabella Lubin I'm aproduct manager here at Google Cloud I'mjoined today by Michelle bertoff who isalso a product manager at Google Cloudwe're super excited to have Scott Allredhere as well Scott is from merits andhe'll be talking about how merits runson Google Cloudso just a quick overview about whatwe'll be talking about today Michelleand I will give a brief intro to aboutwhat we do in our services uh we'll talkabout why we're seeing more and moredatabase customers choose managedservices and kind of the broad spectrumof value that we see customers get outof managed Services we'll talk about howyou can run Oracle on bare metalsolution we'll talk about how you canrun SQL server on cloud SQL Scott willcome on and talk about how merits isrunning on Google cloud and then we'llleave plenty of time at the end for Q aso when we get to the Q a sectionthere's a mic right there just come upto the mic so that everyone can hear youso just a bit about myself as I said myname is Isabelle Lubin I'm a seniorproduct manager here at Google Cloud Ilead Cloud SQL for SQL Server so Ireally focus on how I can help ourcustomers run SQL Server here withGoogle that often means bringing them toCloud SQL for SQL Server that also oftenmeans working very closely with our umour friends over on the compute engineside helping customers run SQL server oncompute engine and sometimes helpingcustomers modernize their SQL Serverworkloads to alloy DB or Cloud SQL forpostgresgood morning hi Michelle bertoff I'm aproduct manager here for Google's baremetal solution we focus primarily onOracle workloads and solving that forour customers meeting you where you areso whether that is lift and shiftmigrating modernizing ultimatelytransforming your business we're herefor you with regards to Oracle baremetal solution is about three-year-oldsolution that we brought to ourcustomers continuing to build ourproduct migrate modernize and very happyto share a little bit more with uh withyou today about that and we're going todive into that shortlyso first we wanted to talk about why wesee more customers moving theirdatabases to manage servicesum this is a you know a reallyinteresting stat from uh from HarvardBusiness School 97 of Business Leadersbelieve that to remain competitive theyneed to be undergoing digitaltransformation and what that reallymeans is that companies are realizingthat they need to be able to iteratemuch much faster on their customerexperience use data for that iterationand continue to drive value both fortheir customers but also whileminimizing risk for their organizationand we see this covering a spectrum ofdatabases right today we're going to betalking about running Oracle and SQLserver with Google Cloudum but you know this this Mandate ofdigital transformation that a lot ofcompanies are seeing is not unique justto the relational database world and sowe wanted to talk about some of thethemes that Google is bringing to all ofour managed database Services whetherthat's you know the relational databaseslike Oracle and SQL server and postgresor in memory DBS documentdbs key valueDBS right so there are a couple ofcommon themes that we have across all ofthese database servicesI want to touch on them really quicklyand I think you'll see many of thesethemes iterated throughout thepresentation as we talk about bare metalsolution and we talk about Cloud SQL forSQL Server so the first is we reallywant to make sure you have a supersimple and easy to use experience thateverything is really built in for you soit's easy for you to manage but alsothat we give you the right Insight sothat you can make sure that you'retuning your databases for what you needtrusted is really important we want tomake sure that you know customers thathave more rigorous requirementsum either you know because of theindustry that they're in or because oftheir organization that we can help themmeet those requirements withcapabilities like built-in Highavailability data protection andsecuritywe want to make sure that we have anopen environment right that we'reintegrated into open source communitiesthat we're providing you with opensource databases in the case of cloudSQL for SQL Server that means that youknow some of these capabilities we'lltalk about a little bit later that it'seasy for you to get your data in andalso easy for you to export your datawe want to make sure that we'reintegrated with the Google Cloudecosystem so capabilities likeFederation with bigquery or how you runwith gke are really important becauseyour database is just one part of youroverall application and being able touse Google cloud services together isreally really critical for many of ourcustomerswe want to make it easy for you tomigrate you know migration is I thinkone of the least fun experiences thatmost people go through so we want tomake it really really easy for you tomove your workloads where you need toand make it easy for you to modernizethose workloads I don't know if folkshave heard about you know a lot of thenew capabilities coming to the Oracle topostgres migrations and how AI isintegrated in that really making surethat we're continuing to iterate on yourmigration experience is super supercritical for us and then finally but youknow not last right Financial governanceand cost we want to make sure thatyou're getting value out of yourdatabases and that you're getting whatyou need so that these are all themesthat you're going to see kind of Infuseacross databases and you know we'regoing to stress these when we talk aboutbare metal solution and when we talkabout Cloud SQL for SQL Serverthanks IsabellaSo today we're going to talk throughthose two different commercial offeringsOracle and SQL Serverwhen we speak to Oracle we have severaldifferent options lift and shift migratemodernize ultimately you might look toseveral of our other Solutions samething when it comes to SQL Servermoving to Oracle we know that moving toCloud innovating modernizing yourworkloads it's not easy you want asolution that ultimately brings Oraclebut you want that without limitationsthe same features the same capabilitiesthat you have on premisesGoogle offers four different solutionsto run your Oracle workloads in thecloud first and most popular is our baremetal solution we're going to dive a bitdeeper into this momentarily but I cantell you that most of our customerschoose Google's bare metal solution thisis our preferred route for customers touse their on-prem licensing and ultimatecapabilitiesthis allows you to run your Oracle racknatively with those same licensing costsas you have on premisesnow what if you run VMware then perhapsGoogle Cloud VMware engine is the rightsolution for you or gcve this is a fullymanaged VMware infrastructure offeringwith Google allows you to lift and shiftyour VMware workloads for use withGoogle Cloudthose are the two most common offeringswe see our customers choosing but whatif you have something that's perhapsmore complex this is where our partneroffered Services come into playengineered Solutions in regions inregion extensions are an offering whereyou can bring your own hardware andoperate those within a low latencyconnection to Google Cloudfinally equinix DB anywhere is anoffering from our partner that alsooffers you that low latency connectionand is available at all of our GoogleCloud locationsso how do you optimize your Googleworkloads with bare metal Solutionsfor customers that are choosing tomigrate to Google Cloud you want toinnovate ultimately you want acost-effective solution that allows easymigration modernization and allows youto innovate with the same services thatare capable on Google Cloudyou can run Oracle databases even rackolder versions and special use cases onbare metal solution we give you a set ofcertified Hardware atos bolsaquanaservers that is optimized and certifiedagain to run those Oracle workloads onthe cloudyou get availability across 13 regionscontinuing to grow and a low latencyconnection less than two millisecondsaway from Google Cloudthis is a fully managed data center withEnterprise grade security architectureand reliability that Google's known forand finally manage storage andnetworking for an optimized migrationconfigurationsohow do you bring the innovation ofGoogle Cloud to your Oracle databasechances are most of you have alreadybeen beneficiaries of bare metal servicetoday it's still early in the morningbut let's do a show of hands and keepyour hands up how many of you made aAirline reservation to get here toGoogle next this year hands up hotelreservationsdid you trade stocks maybe in the lastmonthuh online bankingyeah I think ninety percent of ouraudience here is using a solution or aservice that is uh provided andpopulated by Google's bare metalsolutionnow how do you bring the innovation ofGoogle CloudBMS allows our customers to focus on thefuture and not be stuck in the past soas you start your migration Journeyyou can migrate to Google BMS whilebeginning to integrate more capabilitiesfirstlet's look to data stream you can streamyour data in real time from Oracle tobigquerynext perhaps you want to look to gke tocontainerize your app tier with seamlessaccess to your data in Oracleand finally when you're ready how manyof you been to an alloy DB presentationthis weekall right I like those handswhen you're ready to migrate off ofOracle to open source we can help you bygreat with the uh with the help of duetAi and database migration service theseare all offerings and capabilities thatbearing metal service for Oracle givesyou and we're happy to partner with youand now let me hand it back over toIsabella to share what Google can do foryour databases with SQL server and CloudSQLum okay let's dive into it who here hasalready been to a cloud SQL sessionwhile you're here okay this slide isfamiliar right Cloud SQL is a managedrelational database service it supportsMySQL postgres and SQL Server it's usedby over 95 of Google Cloud's top 100customers and what that means is thatall of these capabilities that customersneed aroundum you know data Protection securityHigh availability those are infusedthroughout the service and a lot of theinfrastructure is actually common whichallows us to do some really interestingthings with how we support SQL ServerCloud SQL is an API first platform weknow that a lot of customers are doingyou know uh terraform drivenprovisioning and management and so wereally want to make sure that we'regiving you all of the management andmaintenance capabilities in an API firstwayso there are three main pillars of cloudSQL for SQL Server the first iscompatibility we want to make sure thatit's easy for you to use all the SQLServer capabilities you're already usingon-prem that you have version currencyso you can keep up with the latestversions of SQL server and that youdon't have to do a lot of conversionwhen you migrate the second pillar isflexibility so moving to a managedservice should not mean that you arelosing control you need the service towork for you you need to work the waythat your organization works so makingsure that you have flexible optionsaround provisioning but also flexibleoptions around things like how do we domaintenance is really really importantfor the service and then the thirdpillar and this is you know relevant toSQL Server you know more than any otherengine I'll say is that a lot of SQLServer customers are traditionalEnterprises that need Enterprisecapabilities and they can't compromiseon that when they move to a managedservice so making sure that we'redelivering capabilities around dataprotection High availability monitoringand security is really critical for usso I'm going to touch on each of thesethree pillars and some of thecapabilities we've recently delivered inthe service and then I'm going to show ademo it is a recorded demo because Idon't trust the Wi-Fi but I'm happy tocome and talk to you afterwards aboutand show show how you can do all of thisprovisioning in the console as wellokay so the firstuh you know we talked aboutcompatibility so the first slide I wantto talk about is all the capabilitiesthat we've been delivering with SQLServer we just launched support for SQLServer 2022 which is the latest versionof SQL Server delivered by Microsoft youcan configure that in the console or youknow via gcloud or API we support SQLServer audit so we have a lot ofcustomers who are leveraging thebuilt-in Google Cloud audit as well butyou can configure audit specificationsusing SQL Server audit if you want to bemonitoring lower level operations inyour database we support link serverswhich allows you to query across otherSQL Server instanceswhen you create an instance you can nowset the time zone that the instanceshould be running in so that you knowyou can make sure that your entireapplication is running in the same timezone and I talked a little bit about youknow this pillar around having an openCloud you can set transactionreplication up either to your Cloud SQLinstance or from your Cloud SQL instanceso you can set up Cloud SQL as publisherfor transactional replication we have alot of customers who are doing thatbecause they want to keepum you know a SQL Server instance inanother environment up to date so youcan set up transactional replication inboth directionswhen it comes to flexibility one of thethings we hear most frequently is thatcustomers really want to make sure thatthey're optimizing price performance sothere are a couple of things I want totouch on the first is that with ha forcloud SQL we provide High availabilityfor all four editions of SQL Server thatwe support we do that because our aha isbuilt off of synchronous replication ata storage layer in two zones of the sameregion so it's not built off of you knowthe SQL Server availability groups theway that we deliver ha is not built offof traditional SQL Server availabilitygroups so you can configure ha for anyaddition of SQL Serverum I don't know if anyone here is usinguh smt off on the compute side forrunning their SQL Server workloads Idon't see any hands um smt off isactually very powerful capability ratherthan having two virtual threads mappedfor physical core you can disablesimultaneous multi-threading and thenhave just one thread map for physicalcore what that means is that from theSQL Server perspective you're actuallyonly having one license thread perphysical core so you're stillprovisioning the same computeinfrastructure but it can help reducelicensing costs for a lot of workloadsthis may have a performance impact so weencourage you to validate this with yourworkloads and try it out but we do havea lot of customers who are leveragingthis to control SQL server licensingcosts and the final point and this is anincreasing theme is consider convergingmultiple databases into a singleinstance we do see a lot of customerswho have you know a tiny database on oneinstance that's actually provisionedwith you know a lot of compute resourcesand if you have too much spread when youmove to the cloud it's a really greatopportunity to consider whether there'sconsolidation that should happenum from an Enterprise Readinessperspective we recently launched supportfor point in time recovery this allowsyou to restore your all databases onyour instance or a single database onthat instance back to a previous timethat's supported for up to seven dayswith Cloud SQL for SQL Server as Imentioned we have automated Highavailability built in for all foureditions you can use read replicas fordisaster recovery so you can create aread replica either in region or inanother region and then if for somereason you need to now have the newprimary running in that other region youcan do a promote of that replicawe recently launched 38 newobservability metrics for SQL Serverthat help you monitor things likeum you know lock weights replication lagand really understand what's going onwith your instanceso when it comes to migrating to CloudSQL you have a couple of options you canimport traditional SQL Server fullbackups we now support striped backupsand I'll show you what that looks likein the demo you can also bring in a fullbackup and then bring in a differentialon top which can again help reducemigration downtime as I mentioned wesupport SQL Server replication so youcan set up replication to Cloud SQL andthen if you're really focused onminimizing downtime we do have a lot ofcustomers who are using some of ourpartners for setting up cdc-basedmigrationsso I'm going to quickly you know runthis demo and we're going to see how itgoesokay great so I'm in the cloud SQLconsoleum this is you know the new instanceprovisioning page as you can see ourdefault is still SQL Server 2019standard but you can configure all ofthe same four editions that we supportwith SQL Server 2022umand again you know aha is provided forall four of those Editionsso we're going to go down here and youcan see how I actually configure Highavailability this is synchronousreplication to two zones in the sameregion if you want to specify the zonethat your primary instance is in andyour secondary instance is in you can doso or you can let us decide and we'llyou know automatically designate whichzone your your primary your secondaryshould be running inforeignthere are a lot of configuration optionsavailable lower down and so you know I Iknow we're trying to simplify theexperience make it really easy for youto configure but if you need tocustomize your instance in any way Iencourage you to expand the customizedoptionsum you'll be able to disablesimultaneous multi-threading under themachine configuration section you can dothat for any machine that is up to sixat least six vcpus you still have tohave a fourth thread minimum ofLicensing so we only allow you toconfigure it for six vcpus or higher andyou can see here that will designate howmany thread SQL Server will see and thatwill be how many threads are licensedfor SQL Servera little bit lower down is where um youcan disable or you can enable point intime recovery by default we takeautomated backups so one every sevendays and you can also enable data pointin time recovery which again will letyou restore all databases on theinstance or you can restore a singledatabase from that instance if you wantto speed up the recovery time and youcan designate how long you want toretain logs for so if for some reasonyou have a shorter retention period youjust need to be able to go back one dayyou can do that designation here as wellum flags and parameters is where you goto enable capabilities like link serversagain this allows you to run queriesthat span not just your primary CloudSQL for SQL Server instance but also runqueries on other SQL Server instances aswell when you create your instance youcan designate the time zone that thatinstance should run in again you know ifthe rest of your application is runningit in Pacific Standard time you canensure that your database runs in thattime zone as welland then I mentioned audit you know alot of customers again use audit tomonitor more granular actions that arebeing taken on their database so onceyou enable audit you can go in andactually create the audit specificationsthat you you of what you want to bemonitoring on your instanceso I'm going to pause here because whatwe've talked about is really mostly thecapabilities of let me see if I canthere we go okay so what we've talkedabout are a lot of the options that youhave when you're provisioning a newinstance but we're going to switch overto an instance that I've alreadyconfigured and I want to show you acouple of things the first is whereyou'll go to enable read replicas ifyou're using any of the other databaseservices this UI is common across all ofthese services so if you're running SQLServer Enterprise Edition you can createread replicas up to eight again thosereplicas can be either in region orcross region under the hood thosereplicas are using SQL Server AGS whichis why this is supported just for SQLServer Enterprise Edition and again ifyou need to you can go and manuallypromote one of those replicasI think I just accidentally stopped itokayumlet's seeit won't let me play the end so I'mgoing to talk to you what the end lookslike and then if you come up to meafterwards I'll show you what uh whatthe ending part of this demo was sowe've talked a lot about the options youhave for configuring your instance righthow you can leverage SQL Servercapabilities built in high availabilitydata protection as well the rest of thedemo was highlighting how you canminimize downtime when you migrate havefolks used striped backups from SQLserver and any other environmentsokay so like a multi-file backup SQLServer will automatically split it okayI see a few hands nowum this is actually pretty powerfulcapability that we've recentlyintegrated into Cloud SQL it allows usto parallelize imports and exports soSQL Server will allow you to split uhfull backup into multiple filesum so when you do an import you canbring in one of those multi-file backupswhich again can allow us to parallelizewhen you do an export if you just enterthe parameter striped on gcloud when youyou know run the export we willautomatically decide how many files tosplit that into the demo would show thedifference but I think when I wasrunning a full backup it took aboutseven and a half hours to do the exportwhen I ran a striped backup it was rightaround two and you can you know if youtest this out for yourself as well onthe import side it's a really good wayof reducing downtime when you'rebringing in data but also if you'redoing regular refreshes of your QAenvironment and you want to be takingexports that run faster taking a stripedexport can really significantly manminimize that downtime and again you canuse the striped importand then bring in a differential on topof it right so you can do a multi-fileimport which is reduce downtime on fullbackup but then bring in thedifferential import again on top of itand all of that together can really helpreduce migration downtime from whatwe've seen with our customersum so with that I'm excited to bringScott on and Scott's going to be talkingabout how merits runs on Google Cloudthank youum Scott already worked for merits I'mdirector of our devops practiceand I'll kind of walk through ourjourney in Google cloud and how we'reusing Cloud SQL specifically SQL Serverso kind of if you look at the historyis back in about 2019 or so we startedlooking for our area on Google Cloud wewere in a couple other Cloud providersand then the bulk of our work wasactually on our on-prem data centerso the reason we did look at GoogleCloudand kind of the driver was around thekubernetes functionality so we werelooking at containerization highavailability things with the um actualapplication workloadsum so we looked at Google we did someproof of Concepts on boardingthe first thing we really worked onafter we onboarded was we did some newcustom application development focusingon we use postgraphs on cloud SQLpostgres at that point and then if youlook at the ongoing work kind of fromthat 2020 up to now we've been migratingour Legacy applications that are runningin our data centerumand then we also right now and I'll talkabout for new workloads we're reallyfocusing on postgres or alloy DB butagain it's that ongoing that big bucketof kind of the things we have runningalready some of our Tech debt some ofthe things that we use cloud SQL forif you look at our strategyaround migrating our existing apps as Isaid the thing that drove us really toGoogle Cloud was the gke it was ourcontainerizationumif you when we're looking at ourdatabase strategy there our goal was tomove our databases to support this otherwork and this other optimization so ourstrategy was we're going to use gke GKautopilot nowum we're going to containerize as manyof the applications as we can increasethe availability of themminimize some of the security work wehave to do on servers so we also haveattempted to as we've migrated kind ofnot rewrite these applications these areones that don't necessarily make senseto do a complete refactor we just wantto get some of the improvements we canwith the technology that's coming alongso we try to minimize the Java codechangesand then a key part when you get to theCloud SQL side is we really weren'tlooking for a lot of optimization on thedatabase side we just wanted somethingthat would enable us to focus where wewanted to which was on the applicationwe did get some good functionalityimprovements some good cost improvementsbut they were kind of secondary to ourstrategyand then the last part was we want tomaximize those commodity or the commontype areas as far as the management wereally wanted to minimize how much wewere having to patch how much we werehaving to upgrade as much as we coulduse managed servicesum it's kind of a generic architecturediagrameveryone of our apps will have a littledifferent but they're going to be a lotof our Legacy ones are going to looksimilar to this which is the center partis what we're really focused on which iscontainerize the Java applicationsget our high availability throughkubernetes minimize our security workwe're doing thereumwe almost everything has a Radice memorystore so we're able to use a man ofservice for thatable to use Mana servers for um SQLServerand then if you look around the that'sthe functionality we get in the cloudthe other kind of common services thatwe can utilizeand then one thing I'll call out hereand I'll call down to the next page isit was kind of an unexpected thing forus an improvement which was some of theability we were getting to controlaccess to our database the networkinggetting people off where we have them onvpns with open network access for localdevelopment being able to leave some ofthe tools around that are available inGoogle SQL proxy especiallyforeignso the benefits we've seen sowe we have functionality benefitsum that we were getting there so reallythe migration was a minimal effort forus to migrateum it wasn't 100 left in shift but itwas pretty close so um we worked a lotwith the Google team on some of themigration the speed the performancethings like that minimize downtimebut we really didn't have to change alot there we did have some lessonslearned and I'll cover those later butum the other thing is we were able toyou know High availability istruly very simple to provision then somaking sure everything we have highavailability and multi-regional or notmulti-reachable multi-zonal I'm kind ofmatching our kubernetesworkload profiles thereum and then the last part is I sent thecloud SQL auth proxyhas really common advantage in lettingus control that network access to thatdatabase and so we have kind of adefense in depth where we can controlthe access to even get to the databaseand we can then control the access atthe SQL Server username passwordum let's just have some workers who ifthey aren't on VPN if they're workingremote they can still get toareas with the right controls aroundthereoperational benefits sominimal ongoing maintenance we're havingto do here it's we're not you know thepatching works wellbackups you know once we got them inplace the amount of workload and whatour dbas have to focus on now becometruly DBA task you know help our appteam figure out performance query issuesnot figuring out the you knowback end you know among the rightversion and my patchingum do I have the right storageum able to scale pretty easilyso usually for our business for thesedifferent applications we have a littlebit of forewarning when we need to scaleup or down so we are able to you knowoptimize our cost and scaling up coreswhen we need to down cores when we needtomonitoring metricsthey've been flowing through we use theoperation Suite so they flow throughthat just the same as our applicationmetrics everything is in the same placeas we need to do troubleshootingumand then the last part is we're prettyclose to 100 percent terraform builds ofour kubernetes side just theinfrastructure everything running withinthe environment theresoso I had a few more questions for ScottI think the first is what surprised youthe most in moving to a managed servicelike Cloud SQL umand I don't know if it was surprised butit was you knowit did live into the promise of theamount of work we were able to kind ofavoid ongoing so right managed serviceshould do that but it doesn't alwaysmeet it but really is you know as I saidour DBA type task our operational typetask have really gone downum the second piece I mentioned earlierwas the security controls the accesscontrols it really is an improvementoverour on-prem data center where accesstended to be controlled by firewalls byIPS now we can get to a closer to zerotrustusing you know iamum bpc service controls so thatfunctionality around there and you'reusing the auth proxy really throughoutright we are okay we are using itheavily yeah yeahumwell what advice would you give toanother company that's also looking toyou know undergo this migration tomanage databasesprobably when you look backLessons Learned umis having our we had quite a few appsI've been running four five ten yearsum over that time troubleshootingum DBA is no longer here dbas are stillhere and don't remember but there were alot of flags there's a lot of uniquenessthatmaybe was needed maybe was not neededbut as we migrated really reviewing theexisting configuration the databaseFlags figuring out which of those applyand then working with the Google team tofigure out which of those we reallywanted to pull forward and which of themwe just should not have even done in thefirst place so to eliminate them yeahyeah we have I think a general bestpractice of when you're moving you likere-evaluate every flag that might impactperformance and anything like that so Ithink that's a great call out yeah andit just I mean it was like withapplications you know as the years go byyou know it's something to fix somethingat midnight you know six years ago wasstill in the database no one rememberedthat flag was set or why it was setum you know and sometimes it matteredand we noticed it sometimes it didn'tyeah yeah I think that's a great calloutum what's next in in merits hismodernization journey yeah so we we'vemoved our large applications out of ourdata center we were down to cut of thesmaller ones that weren't necessarilyum economical to kind of containerizeand hit on those so we um have done alift and shift of the remainingworkloads on our data center into gcpeso we'll start now that we have thosedatabases there we can start choosingit's a little easier to pick offdifferent things we can pick off thedatabase and leave the app and gcve orwe can do reverse now that we're on thesame you know Network backplane we havethat low latency connection so we'llstart working those and as I said we'redoing new application development willbe alloy DB or Cloud SQL postgres we'renot really doing new development in SQLServer right that's more we'll supportthat for our Legacy apps well you shouldalso check out this the DMS the Gen AIdriven migration which I think yeah andthat is true that is true we do havesome more Oracle workloads so just fromthe conversation this week I follow-upsto say is it you know what's the path toyou know do we have a path where wecould get out of our Oracle exit datayeah into alloy DB and use the to add IAI we looked at a couple years ago itwas a little overwith just the number of small changes wehad to make all the way across all oftheplatform yeah well you know thank youfor for partnering with us I can't waitto see what what else merits does onGoogle Cloud okay thank you so muchum so just a few final slides and thenwe'll open up to q a the first isGoogle Cloud ready for cloud SQL this isa designation for partners that workreally well with Cloud SQL I hope yousee some partners that you've workedwith I know I see partners that havehelped various customers in their moveto Cloud SQL so you know if you'relooking for a partner to help you withyour migration with how you're you knowreally running on cloud SQL we encourageyou to check out
