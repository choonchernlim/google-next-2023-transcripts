uphereany any hands no good oh they're sorry Ithink it'syou you can leave you'll be verydisappointed if that was your case forcoming here but uh you know on a moreserious note uh really thank you forbeing hereum I know there are many choices in aconference like this uh thanks forchoosing to spend the next 45 minuteswith usso the three of us have a story to tellhopefully you'll get something out ofthis session with that I'd like towelcome Chris Lee from KeyBank and Anupwith head from Google Cloudgentlemen introduce yourself thanks soDaria good afternoon everybody uh ChrisLee I uh manage the cloud securityarchitecture program for KeyBank whichis a bank Regional Bank located inCleveland Ohio and as Sundar mentionedkind of give you a little bit about ourjourney today partnering with these twofrom a Google Apollo perspectiveI'm the product lead for networksecurity portfolio as well as theapplication delivery portfolio here inGoogle Cloudthank you gentlemen again for joining uson this session so in the session we'regonna we're trying a new format I don'tknow if it's new but it's new for meI've never done this before we'll do acombination of slides where I'm going towalk you through a journey of uh howPalo Alto is looking to solve the cybersecurity problem through our platformstory and I'll interject thatconversation uh that presentation withsome questions to the SD panel here withus so let's get startedsoI'm going to spend a little bit of timetrying to talk about the threatlandscape we have today I'm not going togo to Too Much details but when I wasdoing this research as towhat is the economic impact of cybersecurity attacks I came up with thisnumberand this was a really mind-bogglingnumber I actually thought when I wasGoogling for this information I thoughtthey were talking about the GDP of thethird largest country in the worldso this number that you see right thereis the total Global cyber Revenue impactbecause of all cyber attacks in the year2022did anybody expect this number to bethis highraise your handsvery good I was not even close like Ithought maybe it's in the billions butthat's the number you haveso what are companies doing about it sothey are spending 210 billion dollars onCyber Security Solutions again thisnumber is from 2022 right so it's a bignumber I think it's not big enough andthe way I concluded on that is if youtake 210 billions against 7 trillionthat's the spend of three percentso if you were to look at security as aninsurance I'm not saying it's aninsurance but let's just supposeumthe insurance industry has seven toeight percent is the cost of aninsurance for protecting a certain assetso if you look at it in that terminologythree person is still low so this numberis going to go up cyber security toolsare going to become more and moreimportant the question is where are yougoing to put your dollarsso Cloud adoption is revolutionizingbusiness I mean this is nothing neweverybody knows about this you have thefreedom to focus on Innovation asopposed to infrastructures and serviceyou have a superior technology stackthat all the cloud providers makeAvailable to YouAIML it could be a better database youget the most the best of the classsecurity Stacks to build your technologyon last but not the least the agility ofinnovation right the pace of innovationthe agility of innovation as well as thescale so all of this makes Cloudadoption very very compellingthe two numbers that again verysurprised with these numbers myself whenI was putting together these slidesthose are very high numbersyou've got 92 percent of businesseswhich have a multi-cloud storyit's multi-cloud it's it's more than oneCloud that's mind-boggling rightyou you just you go back five six yearsago the strategy was stick to a singlecloudI mean the multi-cloud is not a strategythat's going to work but things havechanged 87 percent of businesses have ahybrid Cloud Journey like if you haveon-prem applications you can't lift andshift overnight so the as you do thisjourney you tend to be in a hybridstrategy modeyou know but all of this the cloudadoption moving to the cloud comes witha huge Cloud riskif you were to ever talk to a CSO andask them one question hey what's youwhat keeps you up at nightI'm I'm I'm betting that most of themwill say in the top three Cloud adoptionis one of the biggest nightmares I havea lot of reasons for that we talkedabout agility we thought we talked aboutpace of innovationwith all this agility and everybodyrunning with Breakneck speed comes theloss of controlno longer do you have Networkadministrators I.T administrators whoare to who built the ring fence and thefirewalls and the and the mode aroundthe data centers that doesn't happenanymore you have to now talk to devopsdevsecops you need to talk to the cloudsecurity persona so because of thesethings there are a lot of moving partsand security is getting a little out ofhand and you think about security verydifferently45 percent of organizations havesuffered cloud-based data breachit's a data breach I'm not saying 45percent have been hacked they've beenhacked and they've lost the datathat's the problemso that brings me to my first questionChris uh can you briefly describe thejourney KeyBank is on right now withwith your move move to Google cloud andhe approach the security as you'removing things to the cloud absolutelysure so all right how did I get here andhow am I on this journey with thesefolks on the stage right um and itreally started for Key Bank with thosetwo numbers that Sundar showed a coupleslides ago uh with regards to Key Bankbeing on a multi-cloud hybrid CloudJourney right um like most of thoseothers that make up that statisticum right we're realistically doing so ina multi-cloud hybrid Cloud strategyum for key we have been a partner withGoogle and have used Google for some ofour workloads dating back to uhpre-existing my time with Key Bank in inthe late uh 2016-2017 eraum but in January of 2022 uh key made anannouncement and a partnership withGoogle in which we committed toessentially exit our primary datacenters and that over the next three tofive years we'll be moving the bulk ofour workloads into Google Cloud rightand they'll become our primary cloudservice provider so we've started thatJourney we're about 20 months in rightnow and I think from some of the lessonsand some of the work we've done with thethe Palo and the Google team Sundaralluded to right there's there's acouple methodologies for moving to Cloudsome are a lift and shift methodologyright I'm going to just virtualize andre-host everything that I have and thenthere's obviously a strong desireespecially when it comes to unlockingthe performance of the capability andthe power of cloud to say what is mycloud native approach right what is mynew method methodology how am I going toshift this left so we are now in anorganization in a scenario where we arelooking at both of these right andsaying when does it make sense to justkeep things as they are lift and shiftone is it makes sense to move them intoa a cloud native modeland from a holistic perspective andyou'll touch on this a little bit laterum you can kind of see right there's asubset of these domains but we're reallylooking at security holistically rightit's not enough to say well what does itmean that the infrastructure is nowhosted in Google what does that meanfrom a net set perspective right itreally does have to do with applicationsecurity that shift less strategy reallyalso brings you forward in terms of nowI'm doing this protection at an appseclayer not necessarily just relying on intime real time at the netsec layer andthen again all of the others that youcan think of right The Usual Suspectsalong data security and I am so for usthis is really a holistic approach inwhich the the organization is looking todo this and we're trying to do so in amanner from both sides of that lift andshift and shift left culture which meansthat we've got to tackle and haveapproaches for all of these domains uhyou know for both methodsthank you Chris and I think we've talkedabout this right when uh when we talkabout network securitywe're not protecting the network there'sno such thing as protecting the networkright what are you protecting your yourswitches your servers your ethernetcables you're actually protecting theapplications you just happen to belooking in the networkfor people who want to geek out layerthree layer for whatever you have it butnetwork security is still applicationsecurity so thank you for that ChrisI'm going to still sit I'll sit andsince you have the next questionum so I hope again thanks for being hereI know you're at a very busy schedulewith the launch of congratulations onthe launch of couple of your services Iwon't see your thunder so uh so Yuliproduct for network security for GoogleCloud uh can you help us uh you knowfirst talk about your portfolio and thenhow you think about Security in generalsurethanks underso we have a pretty broad portfoliowithin the network securitydomain and I'm going to speak to youabout a few of them today let's startwith the foundational Services Cloud DNSit's a massively scalable low latencyDNS service for both public as well asprivate it has built-in DDOS protectionfor DNS as well as DNS X for securingthe zonesthen comes cloudnat that keeps yournetwork private and also providessecurity for the egress traffic goinginto the internet and more recentlyacross networks as wellnext let's speak about Cloud armor thisis our web application firewall and DDOSprotection services for applicationsthat are exposed to the internet Globalapplicationsah it protects against the known attackslike SQL and SQL injection andcross-eyed scripting and more in thatdomainand it also supports ml based adaptiveprotection that protects our customersfrom the largest known DDOS attacks thathave happened in the pastand then next let's speak about some ofthe network services that providesecurity for the infrastructure layersecure web proxy is something that welaunched about six to nine months backthat is an explicit proxy providingsecurity as well as web app web trafficinspection for egress traffic and thisegress traffic can be out into theinternet or between networks doesn'tmatternext let's speak about Cloud firewallCloud firewall is again a cloud nativeService as of yesterday it wasrestricted to the stateful network-basedpolicies domain-based policies sqdnbased policies geo-based policies but atthis show we have announced a majorexpansion of cloud firewall to cloudngfwwith inline protection powered by PaloAlto Network Serviceswe'll speak more about that in a bitand then the last thing that I wanted totouch upon from a portfolio is yetanother new service that we introducednetwork service integration manager weknow that our needs of our customers arediverseso there are many of you who value theconsistency of operations between youron-prem multi-cloud Estates and if youwant a consistency of network stackacross these environments you would liketo bring your own Appliance basedfirewalls with network serviceintegration manager we have an ecosystemof Partners where Palo Alto is one ofthe partners we provide policy basedinsertion of the traffic to yourAppliance based in gfw with zero networkconfiguration changes and last but notthe least this product also provides asimplified operations with SAS likeconsumption for thatVM based firewallsgoing to my the second question thatSunder asked me how do we look atsecuritywe feel like as customers move to thecloud security should no longer be abolt on it should be built into thenetwork fabric it should scaleseamlessly as the as our customersexpand their footprint on the cloud andso it may not be the right decision tojust replicate your on-premarchitectures in the cloudwe also understand and appreciate thatsecurity is the best of breed market andour customers have choice and so the waywe are looking at Network Security is tomake sure that through a combination oforganic development and with thePartnerships uh with the industryleaders like Palo Alto we provide aportfolio that matches the requirementfrom the marketthank you you know when you were talkingabout bolted on and not built in whatwas thatso the networks you know is thatcopyrighted can I use that yeah you canbut not built in that's a good one youknow talking about copyrights you knowwhen when you call your product GoogleCloud ngfw for the longest time Ithought ngfw is a copyrighted term ortrademarked by Palo Alto I sent an emailto my legal team and said no we haven'tdone that too late to do it anywaycongratulations on the launch of uhGoogle cloud and gfw as well as networkservice integration managerum both of them are really greatproducts so the next section I think wewant to cover a little bit about theplatform story so this is a big deal forus at Palo Altoand I'll tell you whyumthis is why 75 is the reason why so 75is the average number ofPoint solutions for cyber security andaverage Enterprise hasjust think of that 75 Point solutions tosolve cyber cyber crime cyber attacksit's hugeI can vouch for this myself because Iwas in working for one of the biggestSAS companies in the worldwe can look up my LinkedIn you'll knowit but I was I was doing detection andresponse and one day my Caesar comes tome and says hey we're blowing a budgetwith with licensing fees can you you andyour team go to an inventory of productswe usewe came up with 83.out of the 83 we had six of the toolsthat nobody had ever logged in in thepast six monthsyou can just guess how that meeting wenta lot of f-bombs nobody got fired butbut that's a lotand and again when I Google for you knowcyber security categories vendors andproducts this is what I got this was theleast overwhelming of all the picturesand I took it from berkeley.edu if youjust look at this I mean There are 16categoriesbelieve me there's a lot more there are25 to 30 vendors of products within eachcategory there are 3 500 cyber securitycompaniesin U.S aloneChris I know I know we've talked aboutthis and we've had a lot of jokes jokeson this can you tell us a little bitabout your experience with thisproliferation of security toolseither in Key Bank or in a passportabsolutely and actually just for forreference I was in a session earliertoday talking uh that reference toolsprawl right in a very similar Mannerand that that same thing right a numberin the 70s 80s uh just keeps coming upum you know so from my perspective andas we've worked through this from fromKey Bankum you know the the best part aboutcloud and the proliferation of thisright is the fact that there are PointSolutions and that if you have a needright there's most likely a or manytools that can solve that solution orI'm sorry solve that problem for youum but when you think about it from TheChallenge perspective right it's greatto have these tools it's great to sayhey I know that I can account for andshine a light on every aspect of thedomains that we referenced earlierum but in reality right when you look atthose challenges uh we're alreadytalking about the right this lift andshift In This Cloud native uh approachright we've got two different approachesfor two different domains uh well nowtack on top of that that within uh rightthis the same staff footprint becauseunfortunately uh you know manyorganizations we just don't have theability to grow uh and scale you know 2x3x to to account for thisum you know we end up with a challengeof tool fatigue right and and um and umreally just just ending up with toolsaladum and uh you know we'll enable thesethings we'll purchase these things toyour point right they come at a costum and they may be great tools they maybe great uh great uh relationships tohave and vendors to work withum but that's scaling out right is a bigchallenge for usum the the skill building that itrequires is a big challenge for usum and when you you think about the Deepintegration and you talk about cohesionof your platforms every time we addanother vendor every time we add anothersolution uh right the the level ofautomation or integration that you'dlike or or that you'd like to see as youmove to that shift left model or rightthe depth of of the capability of thosetools right some of them do a great jobat providing you insights or doing thefunctions that you need but they're notall maybe mature from an automation or adeep integration standpoint so this isjust something that you know againpersonally I know we've lived in andbreathed for quite some time as we talkabout how do we staff this how do we putthe appropriate tools in because we needthe visibility right we're also not ableto just say it's too many tools I don'twant to do thisum so it's it's definitely a uniqueChallenge and something that I know weabsolutely live with awesome thank youChris I still remember the first time wewere just rehearsing these slides when Ishowed this slide I remember going wowright I mean we are in this industry andeven even now I can't believe that 75was the average number of toolsum so so what's the problem your choiceis good but not in this case not thismuch of choice rightone of the reasons why I shop in Costcoright so so I mean for I think Chrisalluded to a lot of these reasons youknow complexity and integration skillsand training alert fatigue all of theseare very valid reasons and I've livedthrough them in in the company I workedfor in the past uh and it's good to seethat resonates with you as well and it'sa problem not just seen by me but manyothersthe biggest problem with toolproliferation is you don't know yoursecurity posture when you have 80 90tools if somebody says can you give meyour security posturepick your framework in a CSF frameworkmicro attack framework you will not beable to hang your hat on this is mysecurity posture when you have this manytoolsso that's really the uh the problem thatPalo Alto is trying to solve and we'resolving it with the platform Solutionsright so it's easier said than doneright so if you talk to Lee Claridgewho's our chief product officer he saysbuilding a platform is extremely hardright you can't put a bunch of solutionsunder one UI and call it a platform itjust doesn't work that wayeven when you're just in the ideationphase you need to start thinking abouthow the tools talk to each other what isthe deeper integration how do theyconnect the dots all of this stuff isvery important and that's what we've setout to do in in Palo Altososo that brings me to the next slideconsistent security is critical forcloud adoption so I'm going to talkabout two of the three platforms uh heretoday that Palo Alto hasone is you know Chris was alluding toshifting left uh shifting left is just afancy way of saying catch the problem atthe source where the software developerswrite the code Anup was talking aboutSQL injection sqli injection you knowSQL line injections can be prevented atthe firewall but the real problem iscode execution of a SQL command in yourcode if you don't execute it in yourcode you have no problem rightso lifting the problem to the left tothe code solves a lot of headachesDownstream it's much more inexpensive soon and so forth so we have a platformcalled Prisma Cloud I won't go deep intoit it covers the the tools cover thecore the coding phase the building phasethe deploy and runtime environment rightalong with the code build deploy and runyou also need network security for forwhich we have the network securityplatformwe also call it Palo Alto strata whichhas network security firewalls as wellas the sassyso in this it's very important most ofthe attacks that happen todaythey are the attackers are leveragingexisting vulnerabilitiesyou know we all talk about zero dayunknown vulnerabilities the next newthing that nobody knows about no if yousee a vast majority of attacks arehappening on stuff that was discoveredages ago days hours months even yearsago block 4G we talked about lock 4G asa common example it was not a newvulnerability it's been around for thelongest time every company is like on atreadmill trying to patch thesevulnerabilities and everybody knowseverybody has thousands ofvulnerabilities still out there thatthey've not patched if you want toprotect yourself against that you needfirewalls Hardware firewalls softwarefirewalls you need network securityand I won't go deep into thetransformation everybody knows thetraditional applications lift and shiftborn in the cloud applications no matterwhat your journey is whether it's atraditional data center virtualized datacenter or multi-cloud or hybridthe the solution is the sameI'm going to switch a little bit tonetwork security we're going to Deepdive a little bit into network securitytoday because both anoop and myself weown those portfolios in our respectivecompanies so that's the only thing wecan talk aboutumso Anup the next question is to you youheard Chris and I talk about some ofthese challenges right enough ofchallenges we know what can you talkabout some of the solutions that thatyou've thought about and your team hasthought about sheriffs in there so Icompletely agree with many of thechallenges that both yourself and Chrispresented so I'm not going to reiterateso let me start with a couple of stepsright that form the basis of how weapproached this from the net networksecurity side in Googleuh 2022 was the year of malware's andpredominantly ransomerson an average there were 500 million newmalware variants that were discovered ona daily basislast yearokay okay and can you say that again 500500 million variants every malwarevariance on a daily basis 500 millionyes and the second stat that I wanted toshare with you is the 45 percentage ofEnterprises have been breached the statthat Sundar share most of those breacheswere triggered because ofmisconfigurations in the cloudso with these some of these stats welooked into what should the strategy fornetwork security be andand fortunately our vision aligns prettywell with what Sunder projected uhplatform-centric approach to networksecurityand these this platform needs to haveI'll speak about the top threecapabilities that we feel this platformneeds to havefirstlyit needs to have preventive shift leftposture controls that ensure that thereis zero Drift from the intentnumber two broad real-time threatprotection against known as well asunknown threats and this is where mlaibased threat protection comes in uh intothe pictureand third the third important capabilitythat we think this platform needs tohave isblanking out a bit here yeah and thethird capability that we think thisplatform needs to have is it should beopen programmable and needs to make surethat it is tightly integrated with thesock tools so that you have ease ofoperations as well as automatedremediation against alarms and threatsso that's basically in a nutshell whatthe strategy for netsec in Google Cloudthat's awesome thank youso umdo we need hot for firewalls I honestlydon't know why I put this slide on thereuh it was too late to take it out so nowI have to deal with itumno jokes apart I know why I put it inthere so two two reasons one is againthere are stories out there with uhwith a lot of these tools who callthemselves cspms scene apps cwp don'task me what those acronyms mean some ofyou know it better than I do but theseare these are all the modern day toolsthat make you believe thatnetwork security and firewall is oldschool believe me it's notand I've explained it very clearly ifyou have outbound connections that youneed to take care of it could bevirtual desktop infrastructure in thecloudit could be it workloads or it could becorporate workloads corporate workloadsbeing database Services web servers it'snot that people connect to versus uhtraffic going out so in any one of thosefor example if you have a web serverrunning it needs to do an out call for anumber of reels you need to get patchesyou need to stock the third party apisif you have an IT workload it's prettysimple we are all on our desktopsvirtual or physical browsing all kindsof stuff outbound connections commandand control so you need to protect thatI alluded earlier to unknown unknown andknown vulnerabilities that are notpatched you need a firewall to protectyou against thoseand if you want to reduce the blastradius let's say somebody got into thisstuff they've hacked into a system ifyou want to reduce the blast radiusthat's when you have to manage yourlateral East-West traffic as well sothat internal server a which iscompromised doesn't talk to internalserver B so you still have to inspectwhat's what we call the east westtraffic so all of these are reasons whyyou'll still need a firewall I saysoftware firewall here because we'retalking about the cloud cloud workloadsif you still have questions right afterthis session I'll be standing rightthere and we can talkthe second reason is really the mainreason for the slide for this slide soif you don't believe a soft file wall isnecessary please I'm all yoursChris um that brings us to the nextquestion discuss the network securityJourney more in depth you know youtouched upon your journey a little bitearlier but we didn't go deep into thenetwork security and how Key Bank hasleveraged this partnership the thingsthat Google cloud and Palo Alto haveworked together on sure yeah absolutelyright and as a light Touch first as wejust talked about some of thosechallenges and you both referenced someof the the ideology behind Palo and thesolutions that it provides right just togive you a little bit of a resolution onthat topicum you know we really started from theidea of if we work from a lift and shiftworkload perspective and we look at whatdoes it mean to do real-time detectionand real-time understanding of rightvulnerable infrastructure orinfrastructure misconfigurations westarted from a posture of Prisma Cloudright and we can say okay now we knowwhat does our environment look like froman infrastructure perspectiveum and then kind of in that shift leftuh mindset and that idea of toolcohesion and write a shared shared setof tooling we look at those policy setsthat were effectively developed andcurated for our Prisma Cloud environmentand said hey we want parity with thatbut we want to shift it left for ourmodern apps into our pipeline so weultimately turned around and said rightwith uh with Prisma code we're going toplug these policy sets in we're going tocreate parity with what we want from acloud configuration perspective and weuh we ultimately created that dnrci CDpipelines and we've said okay now I'mnot even going to get into the real-timedetection right I don't want PrismaCloud to even tell me that it's outthere because that means it's alreadyout there it's already vulnerable rightit's already misconfigured I'm going todetect this in my policy set inside ofprismacode and ultimately for thosemodern applications especially oranything use a pipeline I'm going toturn around and say you know what I'mgoing to fail this build and you're noteven going to be permitted to do so niceum right so you're not even going to getin the environment and I should see thatalert Trend to down and I think it'sjust important to Marry That with forlift and shift where we don'tnecessarily have that pipeline againthat's going to be important to justrealize that that's why cloud and codefor us kind of right they balance outboth sidesum I think diving deeper into thenetwork security side of this pieceum there were some comments that Anupmade referencing some of the featuresand capabilities that Google hasannounced in partnership with Palo onthe netsack journey side for us rightagain in my mind it comes down to twopieces uh first side is for us being acustomer retail organization uh retailbank is internet-facing presence so youtalk about protecting and using uh froma firewall perspective north-southtraffic whether that be from theInternet or coming from we'll call it anuntrusted third partyum but while that may be a primaryIngress point and that uh accounts forthings like having IPS IDs functionalityright and advanced threat protectionum you know over top of that we alsohave this desire to build out ourisolation and uh move towards that zerotrust I don't really like that wordbecause I think it's a buzzword that canmean many different thingsum but if you look at East-Westprotections from a firewall perspectiveum you know our workloads inside of ourprojects what we really said is I don'tnecessarily want to have to send mytraffic every time up and over through asolution right there are times where itmakes sense for me to use native Googlefunctionality to say I want theseprojects to work at a service accountlevel some other methodology and indoing so uh in an area where I wouldtypically lose those features some ofthe functionality you alluded toespecially for us with Google Cloud IDswe were able to supplement the thepalette footprint with that tooling andbe because of that integration say youknow what back to Tool sprawl I don'tneed to worry about logging in twodifferent places and in two differentmanners my cloud IDs logs in the thecontent that I'm mirroring I'm going tosend in into cortex directly and all inone place from a single pane of glasslook at my IDs for East West from aGoogle perspective as well as my Palonorth south that's amazing that's thethe power of connecting the dots and Idon't know you don't like zero trust Ilove that word I I think it's it's aloaded zero trust it's no implied Trustall right so um so really quick umI think the only salesy slide I have onPalo AltoI had to get the Google approval to putthis on thereso let's talk a little bit about youknow Best in Class network security issomething we're really proud of in PaloAlto these are things that we havedeveloped over many years even decadesand we take Best in Class reallyseriouslyso if you look at any quadrant magicquadrant any quadrant we try to benumber one in all of them and we takethat very seriouslyso couple of a couple of things I wantto talk about hereuhwe'll be up for the fightso what I want us to focus here is onthe different form factors you know theform factor is very important whenyou're in the cloud some people want theflexibility and the control for which wehave the VM series which is the virtualseries of firewalls if you havecontainerized applications and you had afive wall and you need a firewall whichis works very closely with yourcontainers you you have thecontainerized version of the firewalllet's say you want to Outsource all ofthe management of the firewallseven if it's virtual you still have somemanagement to do with scaling andbandwidth and things like thatif you want to Outsource all of thatproblem let's say you have a very smalldevops shop or a psychop shops you haveone person you really can do much withone person that's when you go with amanaged firewall service for which wehave the cloud ngfw the Google cloud andgfw is one of the versions we've got aversion in every major cloud providerAWS Azure and oci also have their ownversion of private service providersthe Crux of the slide is those nineicons sitting on top of the thefirewalls which is the intrusionprevention URL filtering yada yada weactually have 10 we call them Clouddelivered Security Servicesthis is really where the rubber meetsthe road this is where the technologythe real technology of our attackprevention or threat prevention fullyworkswe have an amazing unit 42 threatresearch team we have the Best in Classsecurity Engineers threat researcherswe've invested heavily on these teams tokeep our security signatures up to datewe do 4.1 millionunique security updates4.3 million I thinkunique security updates every day that'san amazing numberso I'll end the slide by talking aboutthe AI and ml powered like like the SVPof my company my boss talks abouttoday we are focused on telling you guyswhat to do right even just telling youwhat to do when there is an attack initself is Victory we want to go fromtelling you what to do to doing it foryou so the way we're going to be doingthat is by enhancing and harnessing thepower of AI and mlso we're going to be AI first cybersecurity company and that's going to bethe focus for us in the near futuresoftware automation is extremely keylike if you guys are an infrastructure scode everything is deployed as code wewant to make sure all of our firewallsare deployed as code the rule stack isdeployed as code policies are can bemanaged to code so we've taken softwareautomation to the next level so ifyou're using terraform ansibleAMD templates cloud formation templateswhat have you we have support for themthat's really it on this slideand again you have the form factors youhave all the technology Stacks that wesupport if there's anything missing herelet's uh please come and talk to me wecan we can have it on the roadmap beforeyou know itconsistent hybrid and multi-cloudvisibility and management is the keyimagine you have Hardware firewalls inyour private data centers or virtualizeddata centersyou have VM series CN series and youhave cloud in gfw being able to manageall of these in a single place when Isay management it's not only managingthem operationally making sure they'reup and running and healthymanaging the rules tax managing thepolicies and logging and monitoringeverything that's coming out of italerts and logs is extremely importantthat you're able to do that in a singleplace a single pane of glass and that'swhat's called Panorama a newer versionof Panorama is going to be launched it'sactually launched we don't have full wedon't have parity between Panorama andwhat we call the starter Cloud managerthat's coming soonbut with launch of strata Cloud manageryou will now have a SAS solution in theplace of Panorama Panorama today has tobe run by yourselfbecause I know you love Panorama youwant to talk about a little bit sureyeah um you know I think we spent a lotof time obviously talking about theshift left culture just a couple slidesago uh Sundar referenced again the theidea of infrastructure and policy ascodeum personally I'm a big fan of thatmodel we've talked about how do youmaintain operations and operationaloverhead with a static sized team withthe sprawl that we're now seeing as wetalk about operating in a multi-cloudmulti-methodology deploymentum uh world uh for us right that's agreat narrative to tell it's a greatdirection to go in but the reality isnot everything is solved as code rightnot everything is solved uh in in thesedeployment manners and in this regardfrom uh from a networking perspectiveand from our networking team perspectiveum because we have this footprint acrossa multi-cloud as well as hybrid with onon premiseum right those teams are all verycomfortable working within Panoramaalready they're already getting a singlepane of glass for all of thosecapabilitieshaving this sprawl into the Palo Altospace that's within our Googleenvironment right again I think it'sjust another great way to sayum you know areas where it doesn't makesense to or areas where we may not beready for automation or doing somethingas code having a single pane of glassand having a single management tool todo all of those functions really doesjust at least save us time as we workthrough again all of the othercomponents that we've talked aboutawesome awesome thank youI think the last uh best for the lastthe partnership with Googleum has been incredible not just with thelaunch of the cloud ngfw but you know Ithink Anup will take us backprobably five years five years waybefore my time probably before before mytime too yeah probably can walk usthrough the Journey that the twocompanies have been and thenwhy did you decide partner with us yeahso the cloud ngfw did not come intobeing with development that happenedover the last two years right this wasthe basis of this was a strongpartnership that was put in place aboutfive years back when we helped Palo Altobring there two of the popular cloudservices Prisma access Empress MacLeodand host it on Google Cloudwith that strong partnership in place wedecided to move ahead and build ideasCloud ideas which is a network basedthreat detection service that welaunched in 2021 it was extremely wellreceived and a strong proof point ofwhat can be achieved when two strongplayers in the industry come togetherso what we did was we decided to moveforward with the inline threatprotection which is basically what wehave launched at the show here cloud andgfw and because of the Palo alto'sstrong IP that powers the inline threatprotection the solution offers 20 timesthe efficacy that similar products fromother Cloud providers have todaysecondly we ah relied on a distributedarchitecture the cloud ngfw continues tobe at the same scale and the operationalSimplicity that we have currently on thecloud firewall that is very populartodayand lastly we are also introducingnetwork security posture controls withthis Cloud ngfw this goes back to theshift left posture control that we werespeaking about earlierwith this set of controls now you canset policies that will follow yourorganized organizational hierarchy andwill also simplify threat response forincidents that happen in yourenvironmentso that's the level of partnership thatwe have launched todayso why did we decide to partner withPalo Alto that's an easy answer lots ofreasonssince this partnership has worked wellfor both companies the number one reasonis because again goes back to the threatefficacy the Fidelity of threatprotection and the ongoing daily updatesthat Palo Alto provides helps ensurethat this is like a best of breedsolution that we can bring to the marketunit 42 that Sunder spoke about givesextremely goodinsights into the new evolving threatsgloballyand thirdly Palo Alto has the broadestinstall base for ngfw and so the threatintelligence that we get from the globaldeployments that Palo Alto already hasallows us to be a step ahead of theadversaries that we have to protect ourcustomers againstthis partnership has worked well forpartnership for Palo Alto as wellthe planet scale Network that Google hasthe AI ml leadership that Google bringsto the table as well as the reliabilityof the Google infrastructure has helpedPalo Alto improve the threat efficacyget Global reach as well as reduce theresponse times so it's a win-winsituation for both companies and it hashelped us provide industry leadingsolutions to the market as wellthank you and appreciate the partnershipand hopefully we'll do many more thingsso Anup talked about so we have thistechnology in Palo Alto whereso we've got 85 000 Cloud tenants outthereso anytime we discover a zero day in anyone of those tenants and we seeindications of compromise for whichwe'll have to push out a new signatureguess what everybody else gets itobviously you need to be subscribed tothose services but you can see thethreat in any one place and you'll getthe benefit of that that's the that'sBest in Classum it's a couple of numbers uh 224billion Network threatsstopped every dayso 224 billion threats are blocked everyday by Palo Alto firewalls I think Italked about the 4.3 million which isunique updates in security patches andsignatures every day thanks to our unit42 fetch research teamso back to you so now that we've comethis farwhere we headed what are we planning ondoing nextso this is just scratching the surfaceright we are super excited about theadvanced threat protection as well asthe Wildfire capabilities that we couldenable on the solution we could alsotake this one step further withconsistent management across Palo Altofirewalls and the Google firewalluh that's just one area that we couldfocus on this show we are also introduwe just announced cross Cloud Networkwhere parallelto is a strong partner andwhat we have done with Prisma accesssolution as part of that partnership isallow our customers to peer the workloadWorkforce traffic directly into theprism access solution negating the needfor any overlay tunnels that arerequired for the solution brings inabout 35 percentage Improvement innetwork latencies and also the ease ofoperations that goes along with it issomething that is very unique in theindustry so there are a lot moreopportunities that AI ml can offer as inin future and I am betting that nextyear will be here speaking to you aboutthe AIML innovations that we arecurrently working onunless you guys can convince me thatsoftware firewalls is not the future andI'll have to change my joball right um with that I think uh Ithink that's all we had uh there's acouple of parting parting thoughts fromour leaders from Palo Alto thank you forcoming everyone thank youthank youforeign"
