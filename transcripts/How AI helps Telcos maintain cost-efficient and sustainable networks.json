    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good afternoon Welcome to Cloud nextthis is naresh Rao head of Telcoanalytics of Google Cloud I'm joined byindustry leader Matthew directornetworks and transport from telefonicaGermany and Jose Luis head of analyticsin Nokia business line today we're goingto talk abouthow telco's leverage Ai and machinelearning to build a sustainable networkswhile reducing the cost so before I handover to Matthias there will be a q asession at the end of the session sofeel free to pose your questions andwe're happy to answer over to youMatthias thank you[Applause]can you hear menot yetnow it's coming okay good good afternoonsoI hope you are not putting lunch or andkeeping your guys busy and I hope youwill enjoy this session so because weheard this morning during Keynotes a lota lot about Ai and he saw manyannouncements and actually what we aregoing to talk about is a real use caseand it's something what is in realitydeployed in our Network and actuallyit's something where we talk about thegreat partnership where we talk aboutGoogle Cloud how it helps us to enablenew Solutions and where we talk about Aiand how we Port all the three thingstogetherso I think we are still fighting a bitwith the sound I guessum my name is order I'm accountof telefonica Germanyand in this all it's not just the thingabout planning the network engineeringNetwork deploying the network but it'salso making sure that we operate thenetwork in the most economical fashionand there we really care about ESGConformity there we talk about ourcarbon footprint and maybe it'sinteresting to know that we serve 44million customers in the German marketand actually almost 50 percent of thosecustomers are young peopleand as many of you know young peoplereally care about the ecosystem theycare about the environment and so as weare serving them we also care about theenvironment but we have some otherchallenges which are more how to saynatural to us or it's our effects it'sour energy costs so what do we pay it'scustomer experience but it's also allcarbon footprint and we faced somechallenges last year andthe main challenge last year has beenthe spike in Energy prices so reallyEnergy prices skyrocketingon the other hand our traffic volumealso still growing exponentially so wewere facing the last two years intraffic rules of more than 40 to 50percent in our Network so naturally thisis the point as a mobile operator youcould think okay I give up because myenergy consumption goes up my trafficgoes up and actually the energy pricesare going up so our operationalexpenditures in our carbon footprintalso doesn't look that nice so it's aniceit's not on yetnow it's better okayI hope it's much better so it was a bituh irritating I have to say so when youlook actually at this chart it depictsvery nicely our challenge so energyconsumption going up traffic going uppaying too much we need to still to keepthe customer experience and havingcustomers who actually care about theenvironment who care about our carbonfootprint so what to do about it uh howcan we how can we cope with thisChallenge and actuallyum we thought about this ER and yes westarted to use the normal means of aoperator introducing new softwareintroducing new features but this isgood enough is this really somethingwhat you should do today and there wereached out to our partner Nokia and askokay what can you offer to steer andcontrol everything what we do in ourNetwork and we reach address to Googleuh asking we have actually some systemsalready running on Google Cloud can weform a partnership to do something whathelps us to cope with the challenge andactually we came up with thispartnership based on the solution ofNokia and Google helping us to enablethe solution andso at the end it's about the goalskeeping growth under control keeping thecarbon footprint under control andintroduce new systems to manage and tohelp us to cope with the challengeand going ahead and this is the mostimportant slide hereum I talked already about the AI but theAI comes really at the end of thejourney in the beginning it's usingsoftware using software in this casefrom our partner Nokia making sure thatyou introduce software as early aspossibleto benefit from all the new featureswhich the partner is developingobviously and there's a fun part of thestory until beginning of last year wewere I think in the Nokia ecosystemalways works last introducing newsoftware which is not the best place tobe and having the challenge which Ioutlined before we decided okay we wantto catch up we want to do somethingcompletely different so the first thingwhat we did we introduced a agile cycleintroducing new software from Nokia andI can tell you the next the last six toseven software releases of Nokia we wereworlds first which is quite something sothat means first we got controlabout all the new features what's thefirst step the Second Step was to tunethose features and also to make surethat we develop own algorithms likeswitching off certain layers in thenetwork during night time which is alsonothing new in the industry it'ssomething what existed for many yearsbut I think we took it to the next leveland then we said okay what what is thenext thing how can we control thiswithout manual intervention how can wemake sure that they're not human beingssitting there and taking control aboutall the features and the layers which ofEtc and this is how the Ava solution forNokia came into the game and where wesaid okay uh this is something what weneed to use and it's up and running andour Network for quite some months nowand it delivers five percent additionalsavingson the whole network so it's a big thingso five percent on the energyconsumption of the world Network it's abig thing what we get here powered by AIand we want to go ahead for sure newfeaturesum I mean we had a chat with Josiebefore and said okay I need more of thisso I need another five percent uh findsomething to make this happen becauseit's for us super super important andyeah now we could ask okay what what hasGoogle to do with this whole thing it itraised quite a bit cold there because uhbuilding this whole thing uh on premisewould mean building separate serversbuilding and test environment so youdouble the investment because you need atest environment you need uh to spin itup and actually I can tell you that thesolution based on Google is two to threetimes more efficient than building it onpremise so this is a big thing what whathelps us the other thing it's time toMarket because we were on a burningplatform last year so we had to findsolutions to get this whole thingtraffic rules energy consumption Energyprices under control as quickly aspossible and here it really helped usthat we could in weeks spin off thesolution to any engine and get it doneand I think this is also thanks toGoogle something what really helped usand it was also a decision was madebased on experience our sun systems forexample and also on the Google cloud andso we knew what we are getting into andI can just say thank you to the twopartners because the the they reallyhelped us and they helped us also stillto manage the carbon footprint becauseit's also the better way to deploy inGoogle rather than to build on premisebecause also this helps to keep thecarbon footprint under control and withthis thing thank you to Partners I wouldlike to hand over to Josie questions youcan ask at the end of the session thankyouthank you matinees for being such a goodpartner for us to be working with you onthis so the first thing that we heardfive percent and this is fairly averagewe've done this with several serviceproviders we have about 80 serviceproviders we're working with around theworld we've been doing this since about2018 so our first live Energy savings in2018 when it was not in fashion to bethinking about this as much as it is nowbut one of the things that is reallyreally important when we're talkingabout Energy savings is that they comethis really four blocks of functionalitythat are really important and two ofthem are using AI the other ones arereally domain experience and this is wecame into the picture because we aretrusted to be able to touch thisnetworks it has hundreds of parametersthat we can tweak and being able tofigure out which ones we need to tweakis also part of the solutioncloser okayall right so let's go take a look atsome of these key things that we broughtand then we use AI for being able toaugment what we're doing on the nodes sothe nodes by themselves are able to dolike what your energy consumption athome like your thermostat you're able toset from this time to this time I wantyou to bring down the temperature rightwe all do this at home the nodes can dothis as well right so they have to theyhave settings where you could say duringthis period of time I would like to beable to power down some of my radiowhat we do beyond that the very firstthing that we do in AI is we open thatwindow we start looking at the trafficload on the radio and be able todetermine and predict what is going tobe the traffic at every given hour ofthe next few weeks and when we arelooking at traffic that is coming downthat gives us an opportunity to be ableto power down some of the the radio thatwe're doing okay so that's the firstaspect of it we needwe need to be able to dynamically expandthis window and to change it any givenday on the weekend it will be differentthan on weekdays on certain periods ofvacation it will be different as well sowe need to be able to expand the windowusing AI with predicting when we can dothingsthe next thing that we do after that iswe have multiple features on the Nodethat we can tweak we leveraging thefeatures on the Node and we're saying wewould like to turn down the frequency wewant to shut off this frequency and wewill keep only one when we have acertain threshold of traffic okay sowe're going to shut down some frequencywe might shut down some antennas okay sothere's multiple antennas sometimes thatare working in in Array together we canshut down some antennas we can shut downsome specific slots that you are sendingtraffic in okay and in addition to thisyou might be doing some things like with4G and 5G often they have their ownfrequencies right then they you need tohave at least one coverage area for eachone of them we coordinate andcollaborate between them so that wecould say we're going to use onecoverage area so we we coordinate thison behalf of the nodesthere's also some of the additionalthings when you're looking at technologyyou might be doing more frequency basedkind of slot or you could be time basedslots and again they have their owncoverage area usually they're separategroups we can collaborate and makingsure that we are using only one group sothere's multiple features like this wehave about a couple of handfuls thatwe're doing over and above what theradios can do and we do thismulti-vendor so that we can tweak alittle bit more and you can see thatlittle bit more that we can tweak givesus about five percent in the case oftelefonicanow the next block so we said DynamicWindows one all the different featuresthat we can use on the different nodesin different ways so we that's our magictrick to be able to understand what eachnode can do whether it's Erickson orHuawei or Nokia the next piece is reallyimportant as well is how aggressive youwant to be I could power off the wholething and then you'd have no serviceright so where's the line at which youwant to be playing so you can decide tobe a little bit more aggressivesometimes maybe in in non-urban areaand you decide that you're going to gofurther or you might decide to go alittle bit less right depending on whereyou are sitting in your in differentkinds of cells and this is what we canset also in the system is making surethat we are able those thresholds on onthe traffic we say well we're going tobe more aggressive and do more powersaving features on different group ofnodes typesso that gives you three blocks now to beable to play with and when we did thesethree blocksum you we got the savings that you werewe were showing there now there's onemore thing that's really important andit will be important to you guys is whenwe are shutting down we need to makesure that we are watching and makingsure that we are not impacting the userexperience it's possible that wepredicted and it's a little bit off sowe need to be able to watch it in realtime and making sure that we're notimpacting certain kinds of thresholds ofquality that we are looking at and if wehappen to be Crossing these qualitymetrics we disengage and we need todisengage really quickly we don't wantto be sitting there and say oh yeahwe're going to be thinking about it for30 minutes and then disengage we need todo this within a few minutes okay sothen we have the fourth block which isreally about watching watching andwatchingum the the kpisall right so here is the graph of whathappened at telefonica so when you'relooking at this picture here you can seeat the very beginning when I'm lookingI'm just going to point out a little bitthe very first window on the left that'swhen there was no Energy savings on theNode whatsoever okay so you could seethe green line is a cumulativeconsumption of energy and the the blueline is the amount of traffic that washappening over that period of timeso as we introduce the nodes the nodesvariable so that's the thermostat rightthe analogy of the thermostat the middlewindow is where we started savings andyou might say I don't understand themiddle window are you saving anythingbecause the line looks like it'sstraight right but it isn't actuallywhen you're looking right in the middleyou could say bump you see the bump inthe middleso this is where the line was going itwas going a little bit more exponentialand then With the Energy savings fromthe nodes we were able to bring it downokay so you can see towards the end ofthe windows coming back down okay andthen what we did is we turned on AIand we turned it on at that in the lastwindow then you could see the amount ofsavings that we were able to to generatefrom that particular last window okayonce we started turning on all thedifferent features that we had includingthe thresholding is and where we weregoing to be putting that threshold andby the way that threshold is generatedby AI so we we look at it and we westart learning the the patterns we saywe should be setting the threshold herebased on how aggressive a conservativeyou want it to beall right so this is what we achieved soin total between the node at two threepercent and five percent with AI we wereable to say about eight to ten percentoveralland then lastly the deployment we doboth on-prem and Cloud deployment forthis solution I prefer by a long shot togo on the cloud it reduces the amount oftime that it takes to deploy fromseveral months eightsix to nine months to one to four monthsthis is what we can say we can turn onthe system and if you're using thestandardized capability that we have wecan turn on the system in about threehoursand that includesthe because now remember in our solutionwe're on a cloud but we need to touchthe network so we have very securePathways for being able to establishbetween our cloud and the radio networkso that nothing can get in into playthere so this is a very secure path whenwe can do this templated as well so wehave vpns going acrossum and then so that's the time to Marketso we're able to go much faster but inaddition to that we're able to be lessexpensive every time you're on Prem it'slike walking into a new Cloud I walkinto DT they will have a specific way ofthe of deploying a cloud I walk intoVerizon I'll work into ATT everybodydeploy slightly differently inside whenI go and work with Google I have one wayI can learn it once and I can do itsuper automated and then it gives me notonly the time to Market but also thereduction in cost that it takes to goand deploy as welland on that note I'm going to pass it onto my friend naresh and you can tell usmore about what you're doing not only onthe course but also on sustainability ofthe cloud itself thank youall right thank youthank you telefonica and Nokia trustingGoogle is your preferred uh Cloud Modelright I think um so so while weunderstand the initiatives of telefonicaand uh you know the overall thesustainability goals it's utmostimportant for us to bring the cleanestCloud right Google has been taking a biginitiatives in terms of sustainabilityand like we are running one of the mostcleanest Cloud since 2017 so we use 100renewable energy resources right I thinkthe even if you compare any otherhyperscalers they would actually takealmost 20 25 to reach that Target sothat's it's extremely important to userenewable energy resources and providethe cleanest Cloud so we use Ai andmachine learning and also mostly thedata driven approach to actuallymaintain our cloud and also our datacenters so this actually ties back tothe overall sustainability goal from uhfrom uh from our operators around theworld right so what is so important herelike if you see the data center itselfhas gravitated towards uh providing moreand more higher performance TPU CPUsright I think you heard in the keynotetoday this morning so we are adding moreand more ammunitions and power to ourdata centers with with this extremelyhigh capable of tpus and CPUs right gpustooso with the in influx of just generativeAI now it's important to actually tobring down the power of theseperformance units so that is why it's uhI mean given the sustainability goalswhile telefonica is saving energy on theRun side we cannot be consuming more andmore energy on the data center sideright so it's a click it's a veryimportant aspect that we provide thecleanest data center so that there is ahuge reduction in the energy overalland one of the other important aspect isthe cooling mechanism right like theheat dissipated around these Networknodes today is actually requires a highcooling requirements so you cannotsimply turn on a high coolers andbasically say that you're trying to saveenergy so it's important to have somesort of a sensor based mechanism wherewe actually ingest the data at an everyfive minutes interval we go through ourdeep learning mechanism to actuallyeffectively manage these cooling so sothat way you will see the overall uh theenergy saving is you know is completelythe energies are optimized and the datacenter runs at a very high performanceratesand and the and most important thing tobuild these kind of AI and machinelearning models you would need thesecore gcp Services right I think Nokiahas been leveraging all some of thesegcp serviceswhile we are talking about all thisbigquery and you know looker and likeall of these great Google services nowthe introduction of this duet Ai andstuff like that it's very very importantto understand these Services isextremely optimized CPU optimized likebasically when the rather traditionallift and shift model is really not anoptimized solution to run on cloud butonce we re-architect once we use moreand more native services this is whereyou will see the complete optimizationthat also includes the Energy savings aswell so so these are this is great butwhat's next right I think we are stillin the journey like we have notcompleted this like this is not just onestory to be told we need to pass thisback in terms of understanding how canwe you know pass this into differentlayers when it comes to this Energysavings maybe I'll pass it on to Mathiaslike what's what's your plan what'swhat's nextI mean I I told it already before I meanwe need more we need more savings but Ithink we need also to educate theecosystem because there's one exampleand many of you might know it networksare compared on the basis of Benchmarktests and when you look at thoseBenchmark tests it's always a comparisonof who or which network has the highestspeed which network can differentiate orbased on speeds on something bettervoice or whatsoever but I think ourYoung Generation demands something elseI mean they want to have a mostefficient Network they want to use thenetwork whenever and wherever they wantI mean this is not going away customerexperience is still key but they don'tnecessarily want to have the one gigabitspeed they want to have maybe the 10megabit wherever whenever they want touse it and they want to have a networkwhich takes care about the ecosystemabout the environment and I think weneed to develop this in the ecosystem togo away from defining just the networkwhich radius radiates the most of energyis the best network I don't think sothis is not what we should do today it'sreally the network which provides thebest customer experience in the mostefficient way to customers I think thisis the best network today and we need towork this out and I think on the otherside I think the AI is not done I thinkthere is more to come and more possibleso our bets are on Nokia Google helpingand I think we can do much more here toget to the most efficient network and totell maybe next time a story that weachieved 10 to 20 savings because thisis where we need to go and this is alsowhat we need to manage and we need tofind the right balance customerexperience efficiency carbon footprintand having a good quality overall andalso telling and selling the story toour customers and this is what we mightdemand but maybe Josie has anotheropinion on it I hope notthank you now there's more we can do wetalked about frequency we talked aboutantenna we talked about time slotstilt is another thing so when you'relooking at the antennas you can starttilting the antennas and it will gofurther out or closer in right so you'reable to play with thisbut in order to play with this you needto make sure you understand the userexperience and the user experience atthe detail level so this is one of thethings where we're going next is reallyunderstand the user experience withinwithin a particular cell lit area and tobe able to kind of adjust the Tilt inreal time so this is one of the areasthat's next that we're looking at but wealso want to rope in all of you we wantto be able to give you the informationand the tools to be able to be part ofthe storybecause this is what scope 3 is doing inESG righthow many of you use Duolingo anybodya fewso in Duolingo you have leaguesso you kind of go up and leave like ohyou did really well this year this weekand you have a lot of points we're goingto put you in the diamond League orwhatever league is next right nowimagine if we could give youwhich one of the Bands you're into as aconsumer by comparison to the rest ofall the consumers on the network mightimagine you are a six and somebody elsemight be a two and someone else is a 10.if you knew how you're consuming thenetwork because your phone is Idlepossibly right nowand then at some point there's going tobe applications that are waking up theconnection in the background you don'tsee it right now but it's happening whatif we could tell you hey you know youhave these applications that are reallyconsuming the network it's going up anddown continuously you could change someconfigurationwhat if we could tell you hey you knowwhat you're currently watching thisvideo at this resolution if you wentdown this way you could save this muchon the energywhat if I told you that you are this faraway from the tower and right now thiscall will be really expensive becausethe tower has to put a lot of energytowards you to power you because you'refar away from the tower do you reallyneed to make that phone call right nowor could it wait until you'll be closerright so there's some things that we cando and inform you about how you bet youcan do better usage of the networkreduce your consumption be able to bringdown your band into a lesser consumptionso that you will be able to participatein the the inner the energy reduction aswelland what if a portion of that reductioncould go towards ESG projects what ifyou were able to contribute directly bydoing that to the project or the quarterfor example that somebody liketelefonica would be setting up so thisis the kind of thing that's next I thinkso it's the service providers are doingeverything and we're continuing to tweakand tweak and tweak and trying to findmore savings but over time we will wantto be able to get all of you to beparticipating in that ecosystem I thinkthis is one of the places that we'regoingall right okay I think um a long storyshort I think we need to makesubscribers are part of this plan rightit just cannot happen operators arediligently working in reducing theenergy and also you know bringingdifferent kind of AI and machinelearning tools constantly tweaking thenetwork but now they're extremelyworried how to balance the network andcustomer experience right I thinkcustomer experience is always the keyfor operators so now if subscribersbecome part of it like basically in myphone I'm seeing there's a red dot and aGreen Dot just for example like Androidhas the power to do that right like whenwe see a red dot saying that okay thethe browsing that what I'm doing isactually consuming high energy or maybethe Green Dot it shows me that I'mconsuming low energy it gives me animmediate opportunity to see how I cancontribute to the motherhood right Ithink that's very very important aspectof it so this is where we are going nextwe are trying to work out to see how wecan actually bring machine learningtools analytics as part of this so wewill be happy to help in jointlycollaborate with telefonica Nokia and wewill see the next Journey as part ofthis so feel free if you have any morequestions or anything uh feel free toshoot out pleasethank you yeah thank you for thispresentationum yeah this was really helpful to learnuh one question I have is uh oh sorrylisten uh sorry in case of a disasterlet's say you know there's an earthquakeor tornado or something and let's saylike uh you know in a city five to tenmillion people just jump on a phone andtry to reach out to other people how howwould that scale with what you have likewe would like to take that fishingokay we just learned that the questionanswers microphone is thereum actually uh in this situation the AIwould not kick in I mean very simple asthis I mean the network is used to thefull extent I mean we would have to copewith other challenges or providing theright capacity to the customers so we inin this particular situation sorry tosay we would not care about the Energysavings we would care about the peopleuh who are desperate or to reachsomebodyum so the idea would go back because Imean also this is the beauty of the i idetects actually the capacity needs ofcustomer and uh at the moment where thenetwork is fully loadedthe I would decide not to switch offanything and also just to use the basicfeatures which could still work but notto switch off the layers not to takefrequencies out not to change maybe inthe future tilting it would make surethat you get the capacity which you needI mean there is no harm but this issomething where actually this is thepower of AI because it's not static It'sNot a Human Being doing something soit's algorithm based what's happeningoh I hope thatsome other questions microphone is overherehello uh thanks this is a reallyinspiring I work in the energy industryso I come with an energy lens have youstarted thinking about how this can uhyou're you're speaking at it from ademand reduction side but have youlooked at how that can even impactFutures energy Supply contracts andfurther savings and even ensuring thatyou do reduce during let's say dirtygrid periods cleaner grid periodscurious to learn a little bit more aboutthatit's actually a good one maybe I I startand then you you ship inum because I mean I mean this maybe alsodifferent or across the world so in inEurope and particularly in Germanyenergy providers are not super Keen togive us a special tariffs because onething about mobile networks we arerather stable in consuming energy soactually we are kind of stabilizingforce in in for an energy provider butso far we were not able to monetize itfor usum so this is one thing but I I couldreally imagine that we built somethingbecause I mean there are some situationsI mean we see now in some markets atcertain periods of time even negativeenergy prices so we would like to usethem also sometimes but not justoverpaying uh all the time but also makeuse that there is maybe a pattern andmaybe synchronizing our pattern with thepattern from the energy provider I Ithink there is still something in yourquestion and there's still somethingwhat might cometo solve me maybe this problem becausefor us it would be being more efficientbut on the other end being stable andgiving something back to the energyprovider I think there could be awin-win situation maybe you could comeas the force partner in crime to developsomething like this but maybe I handover to Josie maybe she has also anopinion on thisyeah so at Nokia sustainability is a bigfile for us and scope one two and threeare really what we're looking at you'reasking about scope too but we'restarting with from scope one rightimagine when you have a dishwasher oreven a car it tells you eight eightliters per 100 kilometers is your carthis is what you're getting right thenyou have all the cars and you cancompare themwell you're not really getting it litersper kilometer per 100 kilometers reallyuh it depends on how much you're drivingwhere you're driving how aggressive youare and you're driving right so you sowhat is what you're using is not goingto be that number so the first part tothat question I'm gonna get there so thefirst part to that question is aboutreporting actually what you're reallyusing this is a really important aspectbecause if you just say I have 100routers times whatever number somebody'stelling me it's not the real consumptionit doesn't match the billso what you want to be able to do is isreporting based on configuration of thenetwork so that's part one of what wewant to do is is the the scope onereportingif you have reporting you can startbringing down you can start comparingand benchmarking and you can startbringing down what your configurationshould be and how you might want tochange it in order to be able to to ingeneral consume lessthen you go to scope two so now it'sokay how are you powering this networkand and how much is being consumed bythe different parts of your network andbe able to report on that and be able toprovide some options on how can youswitch different power supplies indifferent times this is what so there'sa partner that we're starting to workwith so we're investigating we'reinvestigating stage for this one forbeing able to bring what kind of poweryou would want to be able to bring in sothat we can also switch that part in andthen scope three we already talked aboutwhich is the user so yeah this issomething we're working on yeah I'd loveto talk with you more about it we doPartnerships in this space and this isexciting terrific thank you all rightthank you thanksthanks for the very interesting sessionum I have a question on quantificationof the energy consumption of the networkoverall trying to put a bit into aperspective where does actually theenergy being consumed so generallywhat what is the percentage splitbetween the radio Access Network thetransport and then the core and thecloud in terms of the consumption andthen specifically in the radio there isenergy consumption in the compute andthen in the Transmissions a good usesort of size these so where is the 10person saving out of I know it'sdifficult but I like to get a bit moredetail on that I mean I I will not tellthe complete data but uh actually theone thing what you need to remember theradio network consumes most of theenergy of a network operator so actuallyit's a radio network because it's RFyou're transmitting and it's more thanit's between 60 and 70 percent of theoverall consumption of an operator comesfrom the radio network because it'sactually your radius it's not even thecompute it's really your radiosproducing RFunfortunately also producing heat as weknow and uh this is very energyconsumption comes and then you go to thedata centers where you have another 20and uh the radio network I mean youinclude there also transport buttransport is not really the bigcontributor so that means this solutionis really attacking where we have uhactually the real problem so the realproblem transmitting and if you transmitin a constant mannerum you are transmitting and consumingthe same thing at each point of time ofthe day and or your customers are notactive at each point in time of the dayso if you save 10 on the radio cost yousay six percent on the overall Energybill of your network roughly yeah yeahexactly exactly so it's really somethingsoup as a for us super importantthank youone final question or maybe two youstill have five minutes thank you verymuchum one question from what I understoodyour presentation is around the existingNetwork did you is there a possibilityto also look at the deployment of newinfrastructure positioning where tooptimize based on energy source and tominimize the cost of the deployment oryou have another uhokayumit's a it's an extremely good questionumand actually we didn't think about thisat least to be bloody honest uh nobecause usually you place your basestationsum you place them where your customerneeds the base station there's a firstthingum but what we do but this has nothingto do with AI as such what we do is uhchasing end of life topics so forexample all technology is usually notreally energy efficient so having anproper healthy exchange cycle in thenetworkumthose Solutions in combination withSmart Meters they enable us to measureand to pinpoint where we have issueswhere we should do something it's alsoabout sun setting Technologies so forexample many networks all over the worlddid Sunset switchy already as as we didum thinking also about what about 2Gwhat what is coming next I mean but isthere other problem statements otherquestionsum but actually data helps us todetermine where we should do somethingbut maybe it shows yes alsoso maybe I'll add my perspective here sowhen we talk about the softwares right Ithink the any when when they go into thecloudification journey so there has beena monolithic software from a legacystandoff perspective now uh clearly isvsare thinking okay we need to make morecloud ready and they basically they do alift and shift right so that's howmostly they will be very compute intensestorage intents and likewise there willbe more and more energy consumed sothat's the reason that we closelyPartners uh you know with isvs and appsand like we go into a cloudificationjourney where the journey actually takesus into different methodology in termsof you know how this office needs to beclearly cloudified and use more and morenative Services I think we alreadytalked about you know how are tpus andgpus that what we introduce is alreadyhigh performance but consuming stilllower energy right so that portion isalready taken care when it comes toCloud but when it comes to the softwareso this is where we closely work withNokia and then we kind of create thejourney that how effectively they canuse the gcp services in turn they willbe using less and less energyso that holds good for any new networksbe it OSS beat BSS beat you know Networkfunctions likewise right I think it goeson and on like that's that's the journeythat we are in okayokay I would say in general we we have alot of planning toolsum on where to put the radiosandtypically how the capex is going to bespent and where it's going to bedeploying is very much based on wherethe user experience needs to be so thisis what the probably the dominatingfactor which is if let's say I'm in anarea and we're not really able to getthe user experience because you'respreading your spectrum across too manypeople you're going to want to beputting more so it's maybe a secondaryum look at the the primary is reallyabout how do we enable the bestexperience for the subscribers so thisis where the capex is being spent now ifyou have some choices to be able toamaze like I could put it this way thiswith this where I can power it in thesedifferent ways that's a different storyright but the primary reason would belike to the user experience in generalunless you see any different but that'sno I see it exactly the same way butthere's one other thing I mean we arestanding in this nice exhibition hallnow and this is another use case becauseyou have many locations where you havecustomer Gatherings maybe once a week inthe stadium where now this big fear kindof thingy and uh there you want to havethe full power in the air but there willbe other days where actually there's abit of security here nobody is here andthen to power it down in order to saveenergy this is another use case I meanand this is also what we doum when we talk about layer switch offusing the AI because this is somethingwhat we didn't do in the past there wasalways everything in the air but it's asustainable not really nothank youwith this I wouldn't hand back tonourish to
