approachumquick poll who here is involved activelyin optimizingCloud cost any cloudwownice job okay who here has a phenopsteam in that organizationokay and who here is excited about thelong weekend we have coming upall right all right I love theexcitement you're just few more sessionsand you are thereokaysoum my name isoptimization in our Cloud FinanceProfessional Services practices I amdelighted to be joined here by threeleaders who have been deeply involved inoptimizing their Cloud spend at scalewith me joining here is Jonathan wholeads IIT cost optimization at CMEwe have Courtney who leads cloudfinopsat General Mills and Chris who is thedistinguished Cloud architect atPricelinewe have one more person whounfortunately could not join us he wasalready too excited about the Labor Dayweekend meet Albert Einstein others inthe community refers to him as Professorbecause he imparts knowledge and wisdomBeyond Al's average lifespanas you can see from the picture I'm veryjealous he is in borabora Island ishaving the delicious hagendas ice creamby General Millshe saved a ton of cash by findingdiscounted rates for hotels and flightsfrom Pricelinehe's a bit of a show-off so you can seethe pile of cash the Beast now he has astrategy he is going to reinvest that intrading corn using CME platformapparently he learned corn is the newgoalnowI would love to live like this this isan amazing life but it's not as it seemshe is extremely stressful about managinghis Cloud spanso he reached out to us and being aloyal customer for all of us you're likeall right you know it's going to behonest with you all he is theinspiration for this talk and I reallywant to thank you all I really want tothank Jonathan Courtney and Chris forputting genuine effort into sharingtheir expertiseso let's get started we will belistening to uh how industry is reactingon cloud cost optimization we'll bespending a lot of timechatting with our panelists on how theyhave uh embarked on their costoptimization and finoff's journey learnabout their challenges experiences soand so forth and and the wrap up thecall with a bit of a cultural tone andhow vital is it to work together interms of achieving the optimal businessoutcomeall right so at the macro level not justAlbert Einstein we see 62 percent of theorganization plan to optimize theirexisting use of cloud and with theeconomic and financial uncertainty thatwe are in we see more and more our eyesare drawn towards that and this hasbecome a much more critical capabilityas you start to think about Innovationand transformation in Cloudso let's run through a quick costoptimization framework that Albert andhis team is using so we have Joe herehe is being his reports into Albert he'sbeen tasked to optimize his Cloud spanis ready to bring efficiency at all costno pun intendedum so so he he is like all right I wantto look at all of the knobs and leversto help me save money for the companyin his quest he meets Stella who's abusiness partner Stella joins the questshe's like hey this is amazing let's doit togetherbut hey not just cost optimization andcost savings we should also be makingdecisions based on business valuenow as soon as she said she says that alight bulb goes off in Joe's head and heis introduced to the concept ofcloudfinops and the culture shift thatis required to establishcost visibility transparencyoptimization cost controls and more andkeeping business value in mind at allstage of the life cyclehe understands that this is not aone-time thing but rather a continuousiteration across five key pillars offinops that you see here on the screenin an iterative phases of informoptimize and operate as often quoted byphenops Foundationnow with that phenopsis mindset theymeet Grace the architectGrace is like hey power of three hereare the three things you need to thinkabout from a framework perspective asyou optimize your cost in Cloudfirst one being resource optimizationwhich is all about making sure that youare only using the resources that youactually need and the need here is thebusiness value so again you go back tothat point on whether you need thatverbose loggingso the idea here for resourceoptimization is you know getting rid ofidle VMS and databases typically that'swhere customers startright sizing your over provisionresourcesAuto scaling and so and so forthnext one is pricing optimization so thisis about optimizing the rate that youpay right so you are essentially usingthe same resources but you are justpaying a different rate hopefully lowerto optimize your Cloud span and this iswhere things like spend based Communityuse discounts or resource-basedCommunity use discounts comes into theplaythis is often something that ifcustomers have predictable workload forone year or three years they can get ahave to discountor sometimes you know you just aggregateall of your data analytics needs acrossthe organization and start to thinkabout bigquery slot grid reservationsversus having teams to individuallymanage their on-demand spendand then finally we have thearchitectural optimization which isabout embracing Cloud first managedservices and serverless servicesso this is you know you're going Beyondjust the infrastructure cost but you arealso thinking about the cost to manageand supportyou start to in you start to beintentional about what's our developerproductivity velocity you start to thinkabout total cost of ownership as youdesign this architecture from the gradcoand you start to be more proactive soyou bring that cost efficiency duringthe design phase itself and be proactiverather than reactiveJoe does a bit of research works withinternal engineering team product teamsexports from the industry plot togethera graph on two by two vision board abouthey here are all the levers and knobsthat I can pull for my organization tohelp me drive efficiency at scalenow since Joe and his team is startingtheir Journey nowthey are super focused on high value loweffort quadrantnow while this is a great start forAlbert and his team I am delighted tolearn about how our experts havetaken their journey within theirrespective organizationsso let's start with Jonathanuh Jonathan can you tell us a little bitabout CME Group and what your journeyhas has been so faryeah thanks Patrick welcome to everyoneit's great to see that the room isabsolutely packed I'm thrilled to behere alongside Courtney and Chris totalk about cost optimization and fin OpstodayCME Group is the world's leadingderivatives exchange we have more than150 years of History providing RiskManagement Solutions for our customersempathic just mentioned scale the scaleat which our exchange operates is trulymassive now it might not surprise you Iam a numbers person phenops is my breadand butter and I I really likeinteresting statistics so here's aninteresting statistic for all of you inthe room todaywhile we've been at Google next ourexchange has facilitated over 200million orders comprising over 100million trades risk management for ourcustomersin 2021 we signed a 10-year partnershipwith Google Cloud to move our markets tothe cloud and when I say our markets I'mtalking about our infrastructure ourdata center our hundreds of applicationsand our application portfolio and weknew that it would be important to havethin Ops from the very beginningso we grounded ourselves in a charterwith a mission focused on consumingCloud resources effectively and wecreated and formed a hybrid groupconsisting of Partners from Financetechnology and platform engineeringpathetic mentioned the five pillars ofphenops we spent quite a bit of energyinitially on the inform pillar our corelabeling strategy as we scaled both ourworkloads in the cloud and our peopleramping up in cloud serviceswe invested in proactive and reactivecost control policies we'll talk a bitmore about those very shortly and todaywe do a ton with tooling and engagementthrough looker dashboards and lookingfor cost anomaliesagain all this is grounded in kind ofour core Charter which is supported byboth a steering committee and agovernance committee and we use all ofthat collaboration together to make surethat phenops is a success while we learnalong the way so perfect again thank youfor having us I'm thrilled to be hereand I look forward to sharing a bit morevery shortlythanks for sharing that Jonathan andcongratulations to you and CME team forwinning the financial services customerof the Year award thanksall right um so on to Courtney Courtneyhow similar or different your journeyhas been at General Millsyeah thank you perfect and General Millshas been making through the world lovesfor 150 years and hopefully you'reseeing a few brands on here that yourecognize maybe even some that youstarted your day out with some cereal orsome Yoplait or maybe even a granola barand Key to Our Success is innovationand in order to enable that Innovationand really make sure that we'redelivering products that our customerslove we need cloud and we need theInnovation that that can bring to ourbusiness we started our journey in 2019with data and Analyticsshortly after that we began thinkingabout our data center workloads andstarted that over the last 18 monthsthat's really been our Focuswith those is workloads we knew it wasgoing to be important from the beginningto get our cost and our transparencyright and so we actually kicked off ourfinops practicethree months before we assigned our RFPwith Google so it's been a key tenant ofhow we operate our workloads in thecloudvery similar to Jonathan and CME westarted with labeling and costtransparency we wanted to ensure thatour teams had near real-time reportingafter all if you can't see somethingit's very difficult to optimize itwe started with more centralized effortswith our phenops teamso thinking committed use discountsstorage optimization I'll share a littlebit about both of those later and thenreally our Focus today is on how do weenable teams broadly across GeneralMills to be successful with theirvalue that they can deliver through costso that's been where we're headed on ourjourneyI have had a privilege to work with youwhen you have started the finops journeyand I've been a huge fan of what you andteam have done so far in this landscapeum Chris I I have a similar question foryou but then for selfish region I'm alsothinking about what kind of friends andfamily discounts do we get fromPricelineI mean travel is expensive right rightyeah listen uh there's a program calledVIP with Priceline that is a friends andfamily program and it's fantastic I tellyou I use this all the time I highlyrecommend it to everyone and it'savailable to everyone right right out ofthe gate so Priceline is an onlinetravel agency and we've been a leader inthe space for about 25 years we're oneof the companies under booking HoldingsIncorporated and what got us to thatleadership position I think is the thedriving principle which is to helppeople experience the moments thatmatter and we do this through theamazing deals we have in hotel flightAirand recently we've talked about uh Pennyour generative AI assistant which willdrop in and help you understand how tothink about your booking and thatconnected tripum so that that technology of generativeAI the ability to get to that wasfostered by the cloud Journey that wetook right so over that few years wejumped right in um and expanded globallyand were able to expand so much so thatwe became a great partner with Googleum and that's all based on someefficiencies that we had from our onsetright our infrastructure teams werealready efficient in how we managed whatwe did in our data centers with ourHardware with our operating systems thetrick we had was how to evolve thatculturally with our teams and and makesure that that was not just somethingconsumed by the infrastructure teams butacross the entire organization a mindseta culture right and the efficiencyWorkshop we we participated in withpothic and his team helped us emphasizethose cost targets that we wanted tofocus on to really make them actionableand also create those high value loweffort results that really made adifference in our bottom lineawesome thank you for sharing that Chrisand uh kudos to you and your team aswell for winning the devops award of theyear as well thank you all right soum as we dive deeper into the frameworkthat Albert and his team is using Ithink the first thing was resourceoptimization Jonathan I would like toask you what are some of the early winsthat you have seen uh with CMEyeah great Patrick and thank youum we recently relatively started ourCloud journey to gcp which means we'renot fully loaded in the cloud today sowe're really focused on low-hangingfruit as a lot of the folks I think inthe audience areum we're looking mainly today forrepeatable processes that that can beleveraged to prevent waste in the futuretaking actionable insights today and ofcourse learning from those as we go sowe started with cleaning our sandbox andreally our sandbox environment is aplace where folks can go and just playaround with gcp service that was some ofthe the processes or red tape thatsurrounds more of our formal andstructured environments and just bylooking at kind of our entire portfolioof sandbox projects and focusing on the80 20 rule the the key Big Spenders wewere able to avoid around ten thousanddollars a day in waste so that was amanual process that was following upwith those project owners and thoseteams directly to say hey what's goingon here what can we learn from you butit was important for us to get finopsfront and center in front of those folksin the spirit of cultural change thatwas the blamelessness angle hey yourprojects are really expensive we want tounderstand why that's happening and whatwe can do to bring that cost down foryou while still providing you anexcellent level of service in all thetooling that you needso that helped us understand not onlythe use cases for our sandbox but someof our cost control and costoptimization strategies moving forwardit really highlighted for us theimportance of automation early becausewe've only started to scale and we willcontinue to scale both resources in thecloud and folks onboarding into thecloud so we we got the benefit ofoptimizing some spend proactively andthe learning there the takeaway for uswas the importance of early automationthat's awesome I'll take ten thousanddollars savings a day anytimeincredible love the collaborativeapproach that you have with the team interms of working togetherand making such an impact So Courtneywhat's your thoughts when it comes toResource optimization at General Millsyeah absolutely I want to assure two keyareas of resource optimization that havebeen big wins for General Mills thefirst is bigquery quotas so we startedin a similar spot to Jonathan and CMElooking at low hanging fruit but itwasn't long before a little runaway costin bigquery caused us to see theimportance of having great controls andhow important they are to ensuring youget the bill you're expecting at the endof the month and so bigquery quotasreally allow you to set that priceceiling on how much any one project canspend in a day we of course wanted tobalance this with the fact thatInnovation and delivering for ourbusiness is so important so ensuring ourteams are able to run that 99 of thetime and that the quota will just catchthe one percent that somebody's having abad day they hook something up that theydidn't intend to was really critical forus so this is this has really been a keylearning make sure you have those strongcontrols and processes in placethe other item that's been big for us onthe resource optimization has beenstorage costsso two areas here I'd encourage you tolook at if you haven't the first ismaking sure that your storage ismatching your policy so when we firststarted we actually were storing morethan our policy was requiring so justmaking that quick adjustment allowed usto get some good savingssecond we were able to take advantage ofthe snapshot functionality and thatmeant that we could reduce the amount ofsnapshots that we actually needed totake to store that data so combine bothof these actions allowed us to reducethose costs over 90 percent so a hugewin in terms of savings so if youhaven't thought about quotas or yourstorage I highly encourage those as twogreat places to start your resourceoptimization JourneyIlove the art of asking powerfulquestions right like do we need snapshotand if so how long do we need it for andI think those things tie in thatbusiness value perspective intoutilizing your resources so love lovethat approach Courtney thanks forsharing that um Chris do you have a doyou have any any thoughts on resourceoptimization yeah absolutely I think umyou know this recurring theme aroundhigh value and low effort uh for surefor Priceline one of our our key Focusareas is gke for our runtimeenvironmentsum but to get to that point from our ourdata centers required our teams focus onhow to twill Factor their applicationsto make them resilient and redundant andable to recover in a gke environment sothat refactoring takes focus and effortand as we're migrating this also takesfocus and effort as we're moving fromone platform which is very familiar tosomething that's very new and how do weoperationalize these things so to to dothose things it was important to providerunway for teams to to give them thespace they needed to continue with timeto Market efforts which don't go awayand also figure how to refactor the appand then move it in see it operationalin order to give that extra Runway thatextra space we provide the leniency ofconsuming some extra resource so thatyou have the freedom to have stabilityfor for your application but that's inthe intent of as things move now youhave the ability to think about whatlevers to pull in terms of making thingsefficient right so how do we think aboutonce we're in play how we're beenpacking now that we're a 12-factorapplication gke can do its thing andmove prods around to reduce those idlecosts allowing bin packing to do its jobhow can we Target high valueapplications for horizontal pod Autoscaling to allow things to scale up whendid but also more importantly to scaledown to bring those costs downwhat do you think about right sizingthose applications as you lived in adata center the the resources were freeright hey my application needsadditional resource it's already therebut we're in a consumption basis now inCloud so we need to think about how towrite sizes applicationsum additionally leveraging things likespot instances is a fantastic costAdvantage but you have to be able torecover from when that spot instance isis reclaimed and things like preemptiblewhich were previously available rightthose are reclaimed every 24 hours soagain 12 Factor plays a big role thereumthat devops award you mentioned earlierthat came to play as we rolled in HPAand have multiple regions those regionsare relatively imbalanced but they'reactive active so as they take traffic itmay be an 80 20 split of traffic when Ineed to run maintenance I needed to beable to heat up that other site and thatled to our teams thinking about how canwe change hpa's Behavior to preheat thatsite and then we can bring traffic overand bring the other site down formaintenanceso that's what led to that reallyfantastic award which is great and froman HPA perspective we've leveraged italso for things like big table composerand data proc and seeing great resultsawesome thanks for sharing that Chrisand Chris and I were talking about thisbefore our session that back in the dayshe was in a bandand now I'm Venom listening HPA vpa Autoscaling it's like can we create a rapsong out of that like HBA vpawell I'll leave that to all cool yeahthat would be a cool fun learningum that I would love to see um all rightso we we talked about resourceoptimization which is aboutum you know driving your resources moreefficiently again keeping business valuein mind uh the next step for us is likeokay how do we think about readoptimizationum and let's start with Courtney thistime right Courtneyum what do you think aboutum grid optimization pricingoptimization at General Mills yeahabsolutely rate optimization is superimportant for us one of the key tenetsof moving to Cloud was to ensure thatour prices could remain competitive tothose that we saw on-prem while at thesame time being able to take advantageof those Cloud native capabilities incommitted use discounts or cuts are akey way that we do that to ensure wehave really efficient spend on our isworkloads as I mentioned we started ourphenops program in tandem with our ismigration and cuds were one of the firstareas that we looked to we wanted toensure that we had a really efficientprocess and effective process forgetting these workloads up into thecloud at a cost that was optimized sowith that we used a really simpleframework that I'm going to share withyou guys if you're looking for somethingout there I think this is an easy spotto start the first one is be sure toscan the environment so before you arethinking about purchasing make sure youknow are there new machine types comingis there different type of code likeFlex Cubs that could be out there nextensure your meeting and gettingalignment on what your strategy is so doyou want to be 70 committed do you wantto be 95 committed ensuring everybody ison the same page with that fine linebetween optimization and flexibility iscriticalthird then after you've gotten those twohigh level alignments meet with yourfabulous project owners ensure that youunderstand what their needs are going tobe in the upcoming quarter and then youcan finally move into actuallypurchasing the committed use discount sowhen we were in the migration we weremeeting every two weeks in order to dopurchases in near real timenow we're at more of a month to monthand a half as we've gotten more of ourworkloads into the cloudand then finally we route ours forapproval so we want to ensure as thefinops team that what we hear in thatmeeting is actually what everybody isaligned with buying so that just givesus one other step to really check ourcommittees discount process before wefinally go in and execute that purchaseand this process has been reallylightweight I mean we don't spend morethan a couple hours a month on this andit's allowed us to reduce our cost byover 50 percent on our is workloads soyou know highly encourage you toconsider both cuds and a lightweightgovernance framework should go with itto really ensure that you're maximizingthe value at your organizationI I love the five-step process Courtneythat you mentionedum and I think this is something thatmany customers have asked us right likeratherly simply seeming cards can bedaunting and having the five-stepprocess that you just mentioned withlight governance can actually yield alot of tremendous value you mentioned 50uh that's quite a bit of savings sothanks for sharing that Courtneyumall rightChrisso what do you think about readoptimization yeah well one key area I'dlike to share and this has come up acouple times is storage Right storage issomething that in Priceline story as wewent through our migration we found wasa significant cost Dimension that we hadto understand and think about how wewere going to improve on from amigration standpoint we wanted to mimicwhat our constructs were how our datawas structured in its hierarchy so theteams could easily consume it and we canmove it quicklyin doing that right we wanted to makesure that as we went through thatprocess we looked and could see wherethose life cycles were within thathierarchyas we started to examine that um we usedgsutil which a lot of folks are probablyfamiliar with and it became a bitcumbersome for us and wasn't able toscale simply the way we wanted to whichled us to cloud storage insights cloudstorage insights was a big win for usbecause it helped us identify thatobject level metadata information thatwe needed to tie into that object lifecycle management which led to the policyreviews that you know Courtney wastalking about we had a lot of big winsout of the gate with thatadditionally we said hey we've got thisregular data metadata about theseobjects now how do we visualize this sothe team took that data ingested it intobigquery then used composer to aggregatethe data points and then re-inject thatinto bigquery so they could be consumedthrough dashboards by the teams this ledto essentially multi-folder depth ofview that could tie down to theapplication Level for teams to reviewcompared to their policies understandwhat's outside of policy and where thequick wins wereso those are some fantastic things wedid we're looking at alerting onconsumption as well that's some of thethings we're looking towards as well aslast access data points and also Autoclassing and lastly do at AI would be abig win for us in terms of how weconsume what's in cloud storage insideso we're really excited about thatthat's very cool and I also want tothank Chris you and your team becausesome of the times when You Face thesechallenges and bring forth right this isthe thing that influences our productroadmap and looks like you're alreadyusing all of the recent uh announcementsthat the team have absolutely wecouldn't wait to jump out of the gate onthose so it was a big win for us allright awesome uh Jonathan what's yourthought when it comes to readoptimization yeah as we were thinkingthrough talking points and who wouldspeak on which topics um Chris wasrunning through all this content and Icouldn't stop nodding my head becausePriceline and CME share such a similarstory in that we've spent a lot ofenergy thinking about storage toCourtney's point about setting alignmentthe the answers never know when we askthe question do we need to keep thisdata so it was important for us to getthat data to gcp quickly and store ourdata smarter when you think about thescale that I opened with kind of this100 million trades flowing through ourexchange every week like there's a tonof data that comes along with that aswell so with Google's help theProfessional Services we identified somedifferent storage options to optimizethe rate that we pay for data at restand one of the first wins for us wasmoving several petabytes of that datafrom standard tier to Coal Mine and thatsaved us thousands of dollars a day fordata just at rest each and every daytoday we have life life cycle policiesto automatically move that data throughthe different storage tiers and Icertainly recommend looking at lifecyclepolicies if you haven't done that atyour organizations yet because data forus will continue to grow and theautomation that we put in place monthsago still has enormous impacts on thecosts that we pay to keep that dataaround I saw some head nods in the roomtoo when I talked about automation sothank you for being on our side therebut that's really just the quick winthat I wanted to share with the groupagain if you haven't looked at lifecycle policies please take a lookI love the approach that you have rightlike manually trying to ask the rightquestions figuring out where thebusiness value and cost realizationcomes into the play and then once youhave that slap on automation on top ofit to be able to do that and move on tonext big thingumone of the things thatwhat I've heard from all of the storiesis you mentioned about storage insightsyou mentioned about Cuts you mentionedabout life cycle policies and and Ithink thatincluded working with the team and oftenthis is the team which you may notdirectly report into same VP right youare these are cross-functional teamsthat you are working togethercollaborative approach in terms ofgetting things done and at this point Ithink we are talking about somethingmuch more important than technologyright we are talking about humanbehaviors and and culture and earlier inthe session you know one of the favoriteuh definition of culture was what is thedefinition of culture right it's how youbehave when no one is lookingand I would just love to touch upon thatreal quick right what does that culturemeans in in each of your organizationmaybe let's start with Chris you thistimeabsolutely it's a it's a great questionum so at Pricelineum our culture has evolved in thisregard so much so that I've been able toobserve teams being excited to drivetheir own optimizations not somethingdriven down from a phenops team down toother teams with them initiating on thatdirectly how does how does this happenright that's what we're here to learnunderstandI think things often can sound great toto do but harder to execute especiallywhen you have time to Market thingsyou're doing on a regular basis and youhave your routines how do you build innew routines well one of the things witha cloud culture in general is theconcept of self-service right so teamscan now self-serve how they consumethese resources and as they consume andself-serve those resources they can seewhat it is they're consuming and thensee how that's impacted from a costperspective when we surface that to themvisuallyso a couple of things come into playthere when you think about how toprovide that cell service there's sometechnical things you have to workthrough how do you manage security interms of how teams can administer what'sbeing deployed in a self-servicecapacity and at what level what level iscomfortable for those teams so those areconversations that have to happen tothat culture it's about community andconversations acrossadoption once you have those placesthose teams engage now how do they havethe tools that they need to consume thedashboards that show them the cost thatthey want to be able to quicklyvisualize and that goes back to thingsthat Courtney and Jonathan mentionedabout labeling how do I label andattribute those costs and assets that'skey in to get in placethe last thing about the costs right asteams start to think about those coststhey might not be used to thinking aboutwhat network egress is for theirapplication or what the cost of storageis necessarily at for their applicationhow to think about regionality in zonesso you want to make sure that youFosters from an excitement perspectivenot dread that they have to learnsomething brand new but there'ssomething exciting about that for themto engage and grab a hold ofit's very cool you're kind of taking itBeyond you know it's not just adeveloper experience but like the peopleexperience as it touches differentfunction within the organization andmaking it easier and kind of making itexciting for the teams to be able toadopt that that's key that's key so thatbecause they are going to onboard thatinto their new routine so it needs to beexciting and how they how they grab holdof it all right awesome speaking ofexcitement Courtney what's your thoughtsyeah absolutely I love those commentsChris about how important it is toreally get that uh pull versus pushgoing on when it comes to cultureand for us it's been so important toensure that we make driving waste out ofcloud fun that's really critical to oursuccess and so gamification helps to addthat element of both the challenge andcompetition and to really build thatfinops culture at General Mills so we'vetried a few different things fromoptimization all stars that we recognizeto currently we're doing a teamchallengeum so each director's group isincentivized to go out and identifythings that may be on their list wherethey see waste in the cloud and to workon optimizing it and we do weigh it offof a percentage basis so those withlarger spend aren't necessarily unfairlyincentivized and then reward them at theend of the quarter right make sure thatthere's a fun party that there's greatrecognition to leadership that we'reputting it into all of our newslettersand communication and so this is anotheridea that we're trying out and lookforward though of course to doing someother fun things in the future to reallykeep that it's excitement go in andcontinue building that phenops cultureat General MillsI love that approach Courtney and forthose of you who may not be awareum Courtney's thought leadership interms of creating a guide togamification working with FinanceFoundation Community that's really anamazing guide for those of you who aregetting to get started on applyingincentivization within the organizationat scale so again thank you Courtney forsharing that expertise wider with thecommunityJonathanhow do you think about cost-consciousculture excitement all of this at CMEyeah I've been at CME for nearly 13years at this point and one thing that'salways struck me is incredibly powerfulis that the drive to learn within theorganization so I think we've had themost fun and certainly the most successwith our lunch and learn series now inthe spirit of cost optimization we don'tactually buy anybody lunch but we do putourselves in front of anyonecompany-wide to talk about finops andwe've had some really interestingsuccesses there so initially we startedtalking through this pay-as-you-go modelhow do I see what I'm spending in thecloud how do I understand what I'mconsuming in the cloud but today almosta year later we talked through thingslike the Enterprise committed usediscount strategy with with teamshow much they were spending was was thego-to initially and we took thatfeedback to build out our lookerdashboards the teams were askingconsumption questions that we hadn'teven considered so again providing themthe visibility to self-serve into thosemetrics fuels cost optimization from theground up I think it's criticallyimportant for fin Ops to remain visiblethroughout your entire organization andif you haven't considered alreadyluncheon learns with or without lunchpreferably with lunch isn't a bad way tostart getting that input from your teamsgetting in front of them and sharingwhat you know about where you're goingin your roadmapthank you Jonathan uh you kind oftouched up on the the high note thereright it's the phenops teamum that is creating the accelerationit's becoming the enabler and empowersothers to do fin Opsskill within the organization and whenthat happens right that's what yieldstremendous valueuh from a from a business perspective sothank you again for sharing thatperspectiveum rapid fire round I have one morequestion as we wrap up this session whatis one piece of advice that you wouldlike to give Albert we haven't forgottenabout you and all of the friends thatare listening to us right nowlet's start with Jonathan I think I sawAlbert fly throughum all of you are facing this way so youdidn't get to see it but um trust me ithappened I think again Finn Ops keepingit keeping it collaborative the three ofus serve very different Industries butwe all touched on kind of the samechallenges the same Journey that Journeylooks different for everybody in the waythat you can you can plug in and solvethose challenges is and will be uniqueto your organization but keeping itcollaborative is certainly going toserve you in a short short run the longrun and again appreciate you having uson board and I look forward to hearingwhat the others have to say absolutelyyeah I couldn't agree with JonathanMoore hereum at General Mills are friends ofphenops or fof are so critical toeverything that we get done we have afew of our All-Stars over in theaudience here and several more back inMinneapolisuh yes that really bring all of theworks to life and are so critical and Iwould encourage you not just I mean tobuild those branches internally butexternally as well right so ensuring Imean Google's a fabulous resource withpothic and the team to reach out to aswell as if you're not involved in thefinops foundation that's another greatorganization that can really helpaccelerate your journeyyeah that's fantastic Courtney I thinkreallyum there's a recurring theme here andand it's that way for a reason right itdoes take a village to be able to movethis mountain to be able to have thoseteams understand how to engage what toengageum you know you have to build thoseCloud culture constructs that are outthere the the documentation sets thedashboards the things that are easy forfolks to consume understand what theirconcerns are and challenges are rightthat's that's part of that that Villageto understand what needs to beum and enlist in Champions in differentgroups folks that can help Drive indifferent groups and build thatCommunity uh through those thosedocumentsum slack channelsum and lastly uh gated tagging has beena big win for us from the labeling andgovernance and attribution
