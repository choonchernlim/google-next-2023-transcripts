conversationmy name is mangzhou and I lead strategicplatform Partnerships for Googleworkspace and so through thePartnerships that we have we strive togrow the workspace ecosystem by workingwith industry leading partners and thesePartners create valuable solutions forour mutual customersI'm here with you today as a panelmoderator for this next session worksmarter collaboration and productivitytools to help you achieve moreand joining me today I'm so excited tohave our friends from our thrivingpartner ecosystem we have Janabeiswanger from Asana Haley Nelson fromLogitech and montre Ellis from ukgso Jana let's go ahead and start withyou we'd love to hear a little bit moreabout your role at Asana yeah I'm reallyhappy to be here my name is Jana byswinger I lead our business programmanagement office at Asana and for thoseof you who don't know what Asana is weare a leading Enterprise Work Managementplatform where we help companies of allsizes develop smarter ways to work so Ihave about 15 years of experience instrategy business operations customersuccess but what I would say really getsme excited is partnering with teams todrive impact within their organizationso focusing on organizational efficiencyand getting to our end results anddriving real impact so I'm excited todig in with everybody here awesome gladto have you here and Haley if you couldshare a bit about yourself yeah hi HaleyNelson I run the B2B marketing team atLogitech you may know us for our miceand keyboards but our team focuses onbringing video collaboration to Marketalong with Partners like Google we'rereally looking to bridge that gapbetween the at home and remote teamexperience and makeparticipation and collaboration betterand easier for everyone so excited forthe conversation today great thank youHaley and montre we'd love to hear a bitmore about you thank youum I'm also really happy to be here myname is montre Ellis I work for ukgmy I'm responsible for basicallystrategy sorry strategy insights andresearch so basically what my team isresponsible for at ukg and if you'refamiliar with us basically we'reresponsible for human Capital Managementworkforce management most likely youeither get paid by us or you clocked insomewhere using one of our tools but myteam basically looks at kind of thebroader ecosystem of what's happening atthat influx of HCM and workforcemanagement is that body changes we'relooking for those opportunities we canlook to really expand and grow so inparticular that's one of the things wereally love about our partnership withGoogle is we're actually able to bringkind of those intersectional pieces ofsoftware that really kind of meet peoplewhere they live so that we're reallykind of helping to keep kind of thosecritical workers that we look to serveat top of mindwonderful so thanks so much Yana Haleymontre for sharing more about you we'reso excited to have you here todaygetting your insights all aroundcollaboration productivity and reallylearning about how your organizationsEmpower our customers to work smarterand betterum so before we dive in today I justwanted to recognize how incredible it isthat we're actually all able to be herein person it was actually 2019 since thelast time we were together in Mosconeand of course since then 2020 was such amajor inflection point for us and how wethink about work if you remember it wasvirtually overnight that we basicallybecame part of this Global experiment inremote work and so you know as myself asof many of you we certainly pushed ourproductivity and collaboration tools tothe Limit we worked across time zonesliving rooms continents vacation rentalsfor some of us and I think reallythrough that experience we started tounderstand that you know businesses areredefining what productivity means whatwork means in this era of hybrid workand so gradually you know as we startedheading back to the office and movingtowards hybrid work overall we'restarting to Define this new meeting ofproductivityand so like many of your organizationsemployees and teams everywhere now arereally having these fresh and honestconversations about how we can succeedin this new future of work and I thinkat the center of all that is of coursethe two areas that we'll dive into todaywhich is productivity and collaborationum so again you know some of the topicswe'll discuss today are how does thatlook like in this era of distributedwork how do we meet our employees wherethey are and how do we make sure thatworking works for everyone wherever theychoose to work and so at Googleworkspace we actually create tools andsolutions that businesses can use towork more effectively and and be moreproductive but we also realize thatwe're not alone in this and so accordingto a recent study by productiveorganizations are actually using about130 different apps and yours might beusing even moreand a lot of these apps are part of ourpartner ecosystem you'll see these spanacross productivity tools vertical EyeSolutions Hardware Partners really thegoal here of creating Integrations withworkspace that make workspace abest-in-class offering so we're sothrilled to have such robust andthriving partner ecosystem and to haverepresentatives from ukg Lodge attack inAsana here with us today to really sharetheir thoughts on the future of workso let's go ahead and dive right intothe panel and the first question thatI'd love to start with Yana is reallyjust setting the stage here andunderstanding you know what doesproductivity actually mean in the modernworkplace what are some of these loversthat we're seeing organizations pulledto really change what what that meansand then even you know how do we measureproductivity so Jana would love to hearyour thoughts yeahum yeah productivity is always top ofmind for me and for us as anorganizationum and I think there's a lot that wecould all do to really make strides andmore of an impact on our customers ourteams and all of ourselves individuallyum and like you said the Modern Dayworkplace has changed so much so itlooks so different today than it dideven three years ago and you mentionedthere's collaboration in productivityand I see these things these two thingsgoing hand in hand but I'll be direct Iactually think collaboration is prettybroken in today's uh modern workplace sowe did a recent study and found thatemployees report that they lose aboutthree days just to sort of this workabout work and busy work along the wayand this then causes them to lose up to70 percent of their deadline so that tome is like this is broken it's notworking and then when we dig into likewhat are some root causes for that thereare three that always seem to Bubble Upfor us one isum we're working off of siled data soeverybody has different information fromdifferent places and it feels reallysiled and it's hard to collaborate andmake decisions effectively the next isthat our growing Tech stack so youshowed that slide of hey we you know inthe stat of 130 different apps whilethis feels like it's oh we're makinglife simpler it's actually sometimesmaking it more complexum and then the third is a disconnectedWorkforce so as you're in this hybridWorld some employees are remote some arein office some are doing both at thesame time or not at the same timeliterally but they're doing bothum this also gets in the wayso when we think about how do youimprove productivity and overallcollaboration if you just focus on thosethree things you're gonna really drive abig impact in your organizationum and then the other thing to thinkabout too is it's not just aboutproductivity for the sake ofproductivity we've also seen that umthis actually drives the bottom line fora business and has a huge impact so ouranatomy of work index report last timewe ran it we saw that companies thatreported strong cross-functionalcollaboration saw 2x the revenue growththan companies who didn't so to me likethat is what we should all be strivingfor it's about impact and notproductivity for the sake ofproductivity but how do we find theselevers for growth and improving the waywe collaborateawesome and two times revenue is nothingto balk at so super impressiveum you know I'm sure in addition to thatmeasured statistic there's additionaluntangible benefits such as increasedemployee satisfaction greatercohesivenessum so Haley would also love to hear howyou're seeing it um how you think aboutit yeah I agree with Yana thatdisconnected workforces is a bigChallenge and I think I like to thinkabout productivity as yeah how do wemake a meaningful contribution what kindof impact can we make and I think youknow hybrid is rapidly evolvingeveryone's equation looks a little bitdifferent we're still very muchexperimenting certainly at Logitech wewe're sort of our own living lab andwe've just reconfigured our office spacein San Jose to be much more orientedtowards being a place we can bringcustomers to see our products andcollaboration spaces where we can cometogether as teams from time to time andreally do great Jam sessionsum you know I think the main thing rightnow with hybrid is being reallyintentional about the kind of work we doin each space we work in so really beingintentional about designing workspacesand I kind of see three buckets for meand and my team certainly were a globaldistributed team often working async youknow the first is really work from homehow are you really focused and thismight be more of a classic definition ofproductivity what did I accomplish todaywhat did I check off the to-do list andwhether that was through one-on-ones orfocused time you know how how was Iusing my time at home to be mosteffectiveand then when you think aboutcollaboration time in person which nowfeels like such a treat to be able to goto the office occasionally to meet withcolleagues I definitely want to beintentional about how I use my time inperson I don't need to be on you knowvideo meets at the office as much I wantto collaborate I want a whiteboard Iwant to brainstorm you know the the bestuse of time I had last week was taking areally long lunch with one of my directreports who was in from Hawaiiyou know the time we spent workingthrough process and some of theseinterpersonal dynamics that was reallyproductive and so you might say lunchlong lunch is that really productive Ithink in hybrid world yes it's extremelyproductive and we need those moments andwe have to be intentional about themand then I think another learning thatthat some of the companies that aredoing hybrid the best have learned isjust the importance of Deep dive orimmersive time together as teams whetherthat's an on-site or an off-site how doyou structure time that's really aboutbuilding trust you know because we teamsare much more Innovative when they trusteach other they know each other soon-sites and off-sites great times toreally Workshop how we work together howwe can be more productive as a teamhaving fun together really celebratingwork so again being really intentionalabout how we use that time and thinkingabout each of these different modalitiesin different ways to be the mostproductive we can be in each of themgreat thank you Haley for helping usunderstand all the different placesemployees might choose to work and wherewe can equip them to be most effectiveso mantrae would love to kind of closewith you and sort of your thoughtsaround what productivity meansyou know it's really interesting becausewe kind of think about productivityum especially and I want to I'm reallyfocusing kind of on the front lineworker here and those essential workersthat we really said would be importantto us during the pandemic and you knowunfortunately I agree with all of whatyou said but for those workers inparticular we still see productivity ina very traditional sense this idea thatI go in I work and I produce X widgetfor X timeum and we basically rinse and repeat andmove through that but in the world welive together and today we really can'tthink of productivity just in thoselines you know as we start to thinkabout like how we enable and EmpowerFrontline workers the truth is that'sone of the keys so as we look at howtechnology plays in with this Myriad ofapps that they have to that are part oftheir lives a lot of those don'tactually make their lives easier itactually makes it more complicated so wereally have to figure out how we bringall those things together and actuallyproduce tools that allow them to makedecisions in the moment right and makethem they collect the decisions for yourcustomers for other co-workers as wellso when we think about the fact thatright now you know according to hbr 87percent of businesses believe that if wegave people the tools and Empowerempowerment and autonomy to makedecisions in the moment that movebusiness forward especially forFrontline workers that would actuallyprovide a 2X 3x return for anorganization but only only about 20percent of businesses actually do thatso I really see kind of taking thatability of empowering people providingthem with the tools in the moment beingable to answer the questions they needat that moment and being able toactually be part of that virtual cyclethat's the most important piece toreally take productivity to the nextlevel because quite frankly productivityfor human beings is kind of Tapped Outexcellent so thank you montre forhelping us illustrate that there's justa variety of different types of mutualcustomers that we serve and really thatwe need to meet the needs of not justknowledge workers but also our Frontlineworkers so these are really great pointsthey're helping us understand butproductivity and collaboration means inthis changing modern workplaceso thank you so much for helping us setthat Baseline understanding now I wantto move on to actually discussing howthe tools that our organizations haveaddressed this move to age synchronouswork environments so how can we meetworkers where they work when they workhow they choose to work and then how dothese tools help us bridge the gapbetween remote and in-person work andthen also really important to Google andcore tenant even here at Cloud next isthe ability to promote inclusivityEquity VR tools so I'd love to hear fromour panelists you know how are wethinking meeting the diversity ofworkers and users that we serve soMantra I'd actually love to start withyou hereum you know when we think about thepandemic in particular we've you knowwe've all talked about it and how itreally was this transformative momentwe'd already been moving towards ahybrid work remoteum whether people in realize it or notum the pandemic basically acceleratedthat and forced us to it and webasically created this environment wherepeople could do the work they needed todo at home or in some type of hybridwork and we could also do that with someFrontline workers as well you know theinteresting thing that that brought tobear is it also opened up and kind oferased some inequity or feelings ofinequity for you know traditionallymarginalized groups and they enjoy thatfactor of working remotely and now allof a sudden everybody's saying we haveto come back into the office or we haveto be more present and now the thing isfor people who do not want to do that weend up with another other bias which isthat proximity bias and even thoughtechnically there's probably not thatmuch difference in terms of when westart to talk about productivity betweenpeople who work remotely and people whowork in the office there is a perceptionthe managers something like 70 percentof managers don't believe that remoteworkers are actually indispensable orthey feel like they're more dispensableso they're more likely to when they'rethinking about doing layoffs and so onand so forth looking to those in-personworkers I think a big chunk that we haveto do to kind of get over this is reallyhow we think about educatingnot just the kind of workers themselvesbut also that mid-level Frontlinemanager about how do you provide themgoing back to the idea of provide themwith the tools and the moment to makegood decisions or to enable and helptheir workers in that moment so thinkabout these tools that really kind ofnudge them around kind of fairness andopportunity you know they think aboutthese tools that offer the ability toprovide Equity to shifts instead ofpeople basically who you know fit aparticular Dynamic basically alwaysgetting the really good shift sobasically thinking about how do we howdo we move people forward with theactual outcomes of their job as opposedto just filling them time you knowthrough and through with I have to get Xwidget done by X timegreat thanks so much montre and you knowthanks so much for also illustratingthat a lot of this process is justhelping educate our managers thesecompanies as we shift to this new modernworkplace sort of how this is changingso Haley would love to turn it over toyou and really understand at Logitechhow you guys are addressing this yeah Ithinkwe spend a lot of time thinking abouthow we bridge the gap between remote andin person and I think at the core it'sreally about meeting equity and meetingcultureand really enabling full participationright and and I think there's twocomponents to that one is sort of TeamDynamics and how we work and then theother is making sure that you have theright technology and tools so when itcomes to Team Dynamics it's really aboutyou know how do we Empower people toparticipate how do we make sure thatthey feel like they can reallycontribute they can be seen and heardsome of this can be done through thingslike team agreements or team Charterswhere we're really explicit about how wewant to treat each other how we want toshow up for each otherum and our the boundaries we want to putin place you know especially with remotework you know work flows into every partof your life and every hour of the dayso boundaries are really important andso A team's commitment to respectingthose boundaries creates a reallyhealthy kind of collaboration cultureand then of course for us the crucialpiece is the technology and we did asurvey last fall we talked to about 3000 participants and really found thatAudio and Video provisioning has notkept up with a hybrid as it continues toevolve you know people reported thatthey were still propping up laptops onbooks at home they were suffering youknow neck pain wrist pain they don'thave the right ergonomic keyboards andmice and they just weren't set up forsuccess and so you know we spend a lotof time working with I.T leaders to makesure that they are provisioning workersat home with the right types of headsetsyou know I know I'm working at home Ihave construction next to me right nowandum you know we've got this great newheadset that has noise canceling and Iam so into it becausetotally working for me to block out thatconstruction and to continue toeffectively lead my team so uh you knowwork from home setup really crucial thatwe don't ignore that and then on theother side of the screen in the officethat's where we're really focused onmaking sure that people at home can havean equal seat at the table and so ourlatest development is called Logitechsite it's a AI powered tabletop camerathat really frames the participants inthe room so that they can all be seen bythe folks who are at home because youall know the experience of dialing intoa Google me and in the furthest backcorner of the conference room someimportant leader is saying something andyou know you're at home and you can'thear and you're missing importantinformation or a colleague leans overanother in blocks of view or you can'tsee the Whiteboard so we have um we havea fantastic whiteboarding tool thatactually blocks the presenter who'swho's working on the Whiteboard so thatremote participants can see reallyclearly the content on the Whiteboard sothese are the types of tools that youreally need so that folks on theseremote and hybrid teams can feel reallyempowered with the information they needthey're not missing a beat and meetingscan flow seamlessly and collaborationcan yield the kind of innovation that weare all looking forgreat and yes thanks Haley so much forflagging that it's really thecombination and the seamless integrationbetween these software Solutions andhardware tools that really bring thesemeeting experiences to life so Janawould love to end with you and sort ofget your perspective on how Asana isenabling productivityum yeah I um I love what you just saidHaley I feel like I'm the person whenI'm working from home and there's a biggroup meeting I like pin that one and Izoom in I'm like who's talking what isthe facial expression okay I got itum and I think we've all been therebeforeum so I would also say if I take a stepback another way to ensure people aregiving their full body participation ismaking sure that they have the contactsthat they need that their work isvisible and they're involved in theimportant conversations I think that ina nutshell is what we're all striving todo in all of these differentenvironments Haley touched on meetingculture and meeting Norms but I thinkit's just as important to talk about andrecognize the importance of asynchronousculture and asynchronous collaborationtoo so Asana and Google workspace werecompanies that really help enable thatmeeting customers or meeting employeeswhere they are along the way and Imentioned Google workspace because as wetalked about before the growing Techstack can make life more complicatedversus simpler and so instead of justthinking about what are all the appsthat we should be using think reallythoughtfully about what are theIntegrations of the apps that we have tobuild more effective asynchronous workso I'll give two examples of how Googleand Asana partner to build out this typeof you know different types ofIntegrations that meet employees wherethey are so one is our integration withGoogle Docs so a lot of timescollaboration happens in a Google docyou're riffing onum you know this entire panel right whatare we going to talk about what are thequestions we're going to answer and thenin Asana I'm partnering with mymarketing team to say okay great whatare the logistics coordinating all thedifferent pieces so the integrationallows us to use the smart chip featurethat Google has to pull informationcontext directly from Asana into theplace where we're working togetheranother example is through automation sothinking about how do Integrationsunlock your process and workflows tomove better and faster together so ourpartnership and integration with GoogleGmail gcal and Asana allows you to buildrules and automation so that when youhave a deadline coming up you canautomatically detect and see and thenmake sure you have scheduled time to getthat work done on time so all of this isto say you know asynchronous work isjust as important as that live meetingtime to build more effectivecommunication or collaboration along theway I'd also argue it's more effectiveat drivingum you know inclusion and Equity to ifdone thoughtfully so reducing theproximity bias right anybody can doanything anytime in an asynchronousenvironment as long as you have theright Norm set up and you also literallyknock down the physical barriers I don'thave a floor to climb I don't havesomebody's door to knock on and I don'thave to worry about the safety offeeling like I'm comfortable raising myhand whether it be in person orvirtually as well so I encourageeverybody here just to think reallythoughtfully about asynchronous work andhow that also unlocks just bettercollaboration overallgreat thank you so much Gianna for alsoflagging these amazing Integrations thatworkspace and Asana have together andreally ultimately the goal here is toallow users just to remain in the flowwork be able to do their job withouthaving to switch context so thank youfor sharing thatum to wrap up I think we want to endwith a topic that is top of mind foreveryone and that's of course generativeAI so on Tuesday we were really excitedto announce the expansion of duet AIwhich is the generative AI functionalitywithin Google workspace do what reallyhelps our customers be able to createcontent generate insights and it'sreally meant to be helpful and assistiveso closing on that topic about how arewe thinking about AI how are we thinkingabout that in the context ofproductivity and utilizing AI as ahelpful tool to supercharge productivitywe'd love to also understand you knowwhat is the human impact perspectivehere how are we really thinkingcritically about how we bring AI intoour tools so to kick us off on that YanaI'd love to start with your thoughtsyeahum I think AI has a ton of potential toreally change the way we work both longterm and almost immediately and I Ithink it's beyond just the reallyobvious applications like contentcreationum but I want to also recognize the pathforward is not easyum it's sort of like all this ischanging so quick you're like great thisis going to be the Silver Bullet for theproblem I have but as we have beendeveloping our own AI Solutions andtalking to customers the thing that'sbecome super apparent to us is thatthere is a real Gap specifically a workdata Gap and what I mean by that is it'sthe real-time dataum that is really tied to productivityso real-time data around what is thework that's getting done by whom by whenhow is information flowing where isinformation flowing and how do weactually sort of move forward in ourprocesses to go from strategy to plan todelivery along the wayum and I'll give a really practicalexample just to bring it to life ofsomebody who thinks about this and howit might impact their life so I lead ourprogram management office which meanswe're leaving strategic initiatives thatdrive transformational change for ourorganization it requires me to make sureI am escalating risk opportunitiesmaking sure there's seamless flow ofinformation and most importantlyescalating when needed to make sure thatwe're focused on strata executing on thestrategy and making the criticalbusiness decisions we need to make withhigh confidence and done fast so we canremain agile the hardest part of my jobis synthesizing all that information theyou've heard the metaphor we're hurtinglots of cats right that's a lot of myjob where's all this information Cipherthrough it all what do I need toescalate what are the decisions we needto make how do we make sure we're makingthe right progress on this now where AIcomes in is imagine a world where all ofthis data was clean and connectedand I could use that to sort ofsynthesize for me so I can stay in thestrategy layer and I can stay sort ofabreast of what are the decisions weneed to make versus in the weeds ofwhat's all the information that's goingaround so we recently launched orannounced Asana intelligence which isour human-centered approach to Ai andtwo features that I am personally reallyexcited about is there's somethingcalled health checks which effectivelyis leveraging your data your work datato see oh what are the initiatives andprojects that are on track or not ontrack but leveraging AI to sort ofsignal that to you and then the secondis this ask Asana anything so let's sayI want to do a double click greatsomething's off track okay Asana tell mewhat is the blocker what is theinformation that's not being passed whodo I need to escalate being able to askAsana and leverage AI to help uncoverthose key insights in real time for mealong the wayum and so I think there's a recent studythat set out uh that went out that umsaid that I I think it leaders saying AIis the number one 50 of I.T leaders saidAI is the number one thing they'refocused onum and so if any of you in this audienceare thinking about it as wellum and how to make it a competitiveAdvantage for you what's really going tobe important is not how many AI add-onsare you using it's the quality of datathat you're using to feed that Ai and sothat's what I encourage everybody tothink about is how do we create highquality data then the last thing I'mgoing to say because I think withopportunity comes a lot of risk and AIin particular is a bit scary we're inUncharted Territory in terms of thechanges happening so fast and it'sreally hard to anticipate what are thepotential consequences that are aroundthe bend for us so as we are developingour own AI Solutions we use five guidingprinciplesum in everything that we do so the firstis AI should be helping people achievetheir goals at the end of the day it'sfor people and for the workersthemselves the second is as we design AIwe're designing it for humans and AI wedon't just think about the AI it'shumans at the center and then how doesAI help and then the third is we want tomake sure people are accountable for thedecisions think of AI as the suggestionlayer it's the recommendation layer butat the end of the day the outcomes thatyou're driving need to be accountable tothe people who are making the decisionsthemselves and then the final two Iwould just say are you know for us are abit table Stakes it's safety always andthen transparency in practice and in ourproduct as well and so I'm sharing thatbecause I know with the a with AIthere's a lot of fear and there's a lotof anxiety but for us as we have sort ofcharted through this territory keepingall of those four principles in mindreally have helped us make decisionsalong the should we do this or should wedo the other thing and taking thathuman-centered approach I think hashelped us all sort of remain intact withsome shared responsibility around theethics of AI along the wayyes absolutely on I love how you put itthe human-centered approach and I thinkvery similar to how we're thinking aboutat a Google workspace it's reallyplacing that user in the driver's seatand letting them determine when AI getsinvoked when we use Ai and to whatextentum so Mantra I'd love to turn it over toyou and kind of understand from you howukg is seeing thisum so definitely one of the things is weknow this is this is the future this isthe now when we think about how we useAI but one of the things that happensand I think Yana kind of speaks to it alittle bit around we often talk about italmost if it's diametrically opposed tohuman beings really this is about theunity of people and technology and weneed to not think about AI as areplacement for human beings but reallywhen we get to that really interestingaugmentation of human beings and so Ithink when we think about some of thosemodels I think it does induce fearsparticularly induces fearum kind of at the you know in the frontline worker layer and really for us nowwe are looking at kind of traditionalwhite-collar workers are actuallyexperiencing that fear of what happenssaying around kind of replacing our jobsso I think one thing is thatum for the most part only 41 of mostFrontline workers and essential workersare excited about AI compared to almostdouble their managers in the executiveso that means there's something brokenin the messaging some part of it is whenwe roll out this new technology often wedo it with no context so we don'texplain why this is beneficial so peopleoften have have this inherent fearpeople fear change they fear what theydon't truly understand so I think thatwe have a requirement to really as weroll these things out really explainwhat they do and kind of where we thinkabout from our perspective is we want tobring from a ukg perspective is how dowe make people's lives easier do we givethem a little bit of time left do wemakeum a little bit time back so instead ofwalking across the warehouse floor fromone end to the other can I make iteasier for you to punch in transfer orall of those things so you don't have towait in line so that you can actuallyget an extra five minutes where you callyour child or you talk to your friendand those things that we're able to giveback to people's lives those are themost important things so we're reallytrying to leverage our relationship withGoogle as we think about thoseIntegrations that we bring to bear sothey're simple things about how yourequest PTO you know how do I not haveto roll into that kind of spiral ofanxiety if I'm an introvert about I hadget somebody to replace my shift we'realso able to bring in kind of those AImodels and technology that really kindof looks to make sure that when I do askfor a shift swap I'm actually gettingthe people that have the skills the caseof capabilities we also look at kind ofthe recency index so we don't actuallywant to put somebody in the position whohad that skill but they haven't usedthat skill in three years so we'rereally kind of engaging in those typesof models to make sure that we basicallygive something back to people so theywalk away thinking that AI is reallyhelping and enabling them not adeterrentabsolutely and I love how you put it soeloquently that you know we're reallylooking at AI as something to help uswith the tours that we do the tasks thatwe just don't want to actually have todo and you know put aside and really umhow AI can help us focus on the thingsthat really matter soum Haley to close us off would love tounderstand how you're seeing this fromthe views of Logitech yeah yeah and Ilove what both of you said Jana I hopethose guiding principles are somewhereon a blog post from Asana out there thatwe can grab and and Mantra I think youknow in the similar vein yeah I think AIis an important ingredient in ourtechnology but really for the aim of ofcreating better human experiencesum and and we're trying to leverage AIto make the remote experience as good oreven better than being there in personwhen it comes to remote and hybridmeetingsum because really it's about enablingall the participants on teams to haveall the information they need so if theycan't be in the room making sure thatall the information and trendtransparency is there so that teams canreally make the best decisions and andcollaborate effectivelyum so I think you know during thepandemic when we were all at home therewas some sort of equity in that we allhad equal squares on the screenum and certainly now that we're back toa hybrid situation we're faced withmeetings that are sub-optimal where youreally can't see and hear everyone inthe room and so our new AIcamera site really leverages the powerof AI to to detect and accurately frameparticipants in the room so it has thissort of adaptive intelligence thatchooses the best camera of the momentwhether it's the front of room camera orthe tabletop camera to follow theconversation between participants sothat Folks at home can follow it andeasily jump in and participate and so Ithink that's sort of where we'releveraging AI to for these goals we havearound meeting Equityyou know if you think of a Hollywooddirector a Hollywood director is pickingthe best views and and editing those foryou and that's exactly what AI does forus with Logitech site it brings thosebest views togetherum I think we're also working withPartners like Google to use you know heyGoogle hands-free voice prompts so thatpeople can walk into a room use thevoice prompt to join a video meeting toend a meeting to use uh you know make adial-up call so these are just the waysthat that AI is become a part of ourSolutions and are reallyum it's it's really just a crucialingredient in helping uscreate the best and most effectivecollaboration experiencesabsolutely so thank you so much to YanaHaley montre for bringing us throughthis entire journey of how we'reshifting what we're defining asproductivity and collaboration in themodern workplace sharing how you'rethinking about it from your respectivecompanies and also closing us out on howgen AI is going to shape this in thefutureforeign"
