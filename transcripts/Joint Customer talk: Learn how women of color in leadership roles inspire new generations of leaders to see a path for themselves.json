    "transcript": "foreign[Music]I am a Google Cloud Consulting accountlead I'm also part of women at Cloudleadership team in Google cloud and Iidentify as women of color and I'mhonored to lead this discussion andmoderating this amazing panelwith that what to expect in this sessionin this session you'll hear from twoamazing gcp customers Julio anirFoundation an amazing women leaders fromthat team to talk about how they reallypartnered with Google Cloud to evolvetheir diversity equity and inclusionfocus and how they're continuouslypartnering with us and what's our BetterTogether storyuh but before we get into the paneldiscussion I do wanted to spend sometime which I think most of us in thegroup as I see what already agree orknow is who are people of color who arewomen of color and why it mattersso people of color are individuals whoidentify with the race or ethnicity thatis not considered to be whiteuh this could include people of AsianAfrican latinx and Native Americanbackgroundswomen of color are people of color thatidentifies women in that uh kind of areawhy it matters so as you see the statsand I'm sure a lot of us have seen thestats across different sources differentears and across different groupsit matters because while we've readthrough the strats we have made a lot ofprogress It's still stagnallyunderrepresentativeespecially in c-level leadership we haveless than five percent in sea levelleadership although we make women ofcolor make significant portion of thatworkspace in fact I was reading thisreally interesting stat by Catalyst thatby 2016 although we're already gettingthere everyone in five women areactually progressing to be women ofcolor but that doesn't necessarily meanit's going to be senior leadershipum ratio in gender biasesare barriers to significant advancementof this race like significantadvancement of all underrepresentativegroups in that matterin the intersection of the systemicinequalitiesfor their outsides and impact this groupthe mostsome of us have been through it all ofour challenges are different we embracethe differences but we also learn from alot of these challengesso like I said we have made significantprogress we should celebrate theprogress but the statistics is not whatwe want so I still see this notnecessarily as just challenging storybut an opportunity because we each playand should play an important role toidentify Elevate and Empower these nextgeneration of women of color andLeadershipso with that said by working together wecan create an equitable workspace giveopportunities identify new leaders andelevatethat's why I'm excited to host thispanel I'm honored to be leading thispanel as women of color and we have dothese two amazing panelists alsoidentify as women of colorthese are the leaders who are workingday in day out to expand the impressionof what leadership should look likeand learn and figure out how do wecreate these opportunities togetherI do see in the group again a lot of usare here who relate to this in some wayor the otherwe definitely want people who don'trelate to this also to know that becausethat's where the most unconscious biasesstart it's not conscious a lot of it isnot conscious hopefully but some areunconscious but againI think a baby steps maybe like at leastthat's what this representationdefinitely tells me but I'm superexcited for you guys definitely want wewant this discussion to be superengaging while we have panel we want theaudience to ask us questions share theirchallenging stories and let's learn fromeach of our diverse experiencesso without wasting more time on my talkI'll just intro our amazing panelist ayoung uh welcome to the stage he leadsthe developer engagement efforts at nearFoundation working to push for morediversity and inclusivity in developerlandscapeshe actually is one of the key person toempower the underrepresentative dovesand I think one of the main things I dowant to say English is not her firstlanguage but English voice her one ofthe core subjects in schooland she pursued liberal arts degree andyet she has only worked in Tech sowelcome ayal our second panelist is Miramirovanathan is Vice President ofproduct management at tolio she's anaccomplished product leader with overtwo decadesof experience and she has an experienceacross a lot of diverse landscape Meeraknows seven plus languages and Englishis also not her first language so all ofus actually who will be talking aboutour share experience English is not ourfirst language we all immigratedI think me right I immigrated as firstgeneration to move from our countries toAmerica and we all identify as women ofcolorso with that thank you we'll get intothe panel discussion[Applause]awesome sookay perfect these chairsum I think like as the audience is alsohere and you can see the group that wehave todayum a lot of us ask you know to kind ofchallenge ourselves if we are the onlyone who was going through this or whatis even unconscious biases that peopleof color as well as women of color seein leadership role so I I want you guysto like talk through maybe starting witha young what those unconscious biasesyou have seen and what those challengesyou've gone through and most importantbecause we do talk about challengeseverybody is like again we embrace thedifference we talk about challenges butmost importantly what was a breakthroughmoment where you figured it out or atleast like figuring it's still out andpeople the new generation of leaders canlearn from it yeahum thank you and thank you all forcoming todayum yeah so I think my journey to where Iam right now today with you lovely folksisum yeah my exposure tobiases and especially targeted at womenof color started also fairly early withmy immigrant mother and so we immigratedto the States from Korea when I was sixyears old and so I got firsthand uh youknow experience just seeing my motherreally struggling to find a role withinher profession when we first moved wewere living in a predominantly whitearea of the country and so it wasumchallenging to say the least for her tofind a footing when she didn't speakEnglish very well she definitely did notlook like many of the people who were inher profession as well and over time shedid manage to climb up slowly but surelybut it still was very evident that shewas never going to be able to reach thetop ranks because again she did notsound like what they assumed a leaderwould sound like neither does she looklike oneand I like coincidentally I actuallywent to a women's collegeand my I went to Wellesley College whichis right outside of Boston and during mytime there hello during my time there Iactually really got a privileged view ofwhat it can look like when women are inleadership roles because at a women'scollege all the clubs on campus all ofthe student organizations all theleaders are women and that is actuallysomething that we really get toexperience and that was sort of my firstreal life example of wow women are justas capable as Leaders just as anyoneelse and that was kind of when Irealized like leaders truly arecreative and they're not born that wayand so all of these like biases thatimpact us as we're growing up I think weinternalize a lot of it as well and thatdefinitely was the case for me because Ifeel like I kind ofumI guess maybe to backtrack so during mytime at Wellesley I actually did aliberal arts degree as Gina mentioned Istudied political science and economicsand when I graduated I never would havethought I would be working in Tech buthere I amum and I've never lefta lot of reason is because I do feellike there's a lot of opportunity for usto make a difference and umover the course of my time and my careerI realized that I kind of wanted to be apart of the force for change we see alot of the statistics you know we evensaw them todayum and there's just a lot ofunderrepresented groups andum I realize if you want to be a part oflike the hiring decisions if you want tobe a part of really helping to set teamculture you have to be on that side ofthe fence and so most of my career Ispent a very business adjacent but thenI decided to make the transition tobeing more technical adjacent thattransition did not go very easily ittook multiple years and again I think Iface both external and internal biasesthat kind of you know it I mean I thinkof it as just imposter syndromebut one I think the fact that I was ableto make this transition is progress initself I think that also says a lot tohow far we've comebut I also do think that there's so muchmore that we can be doing and yeah Ithink just speaking of and having theseopportunities to share is just reallyimportantyeah I I love that story that I meanultimately it stands out at resiliencekind of overcome intersectionalities butat the same time like having thatopportunity like learning from otherwomen as you grew up in that environmentis is core to like seeing thatopportunities exist you just have tocreate one and be at the stable for sureuh Mina what about you like of courselike you immigrated the United Statesyou had like over two decades ofexperience you started early on andtimes might be even more different andless Progressiveso not really more experienced immatureum so what what do you think like thosebiases and how to deal with this how toenable people who are unconsciouslymaybe are going through that yeah I meanI don't even think I was aware thatthere were biases so this was you knowgoing back 20 years when I started offin in Tech and it was more on theeducation side of tech so here I'mworking on a you know highly technicalproduct you know lots of data you knowmillions of daily active users and so onandum I'm not that my background is ananthropology I don't have a technicalbackground and I'm a woman oh my God allthe odds are now stacked against me andI'm sitting in these rooms and I'mhaving this out of Body Experience whereI had self-doubt myself right I'msitting there thinking like is thissomething that I can understand is thissomething that you know I can actuallymake a go of likeLita came to be known as impostersyndrome I guess I was experiencing thisuh uh then and really the Breakthroughfor me actually happened pretty early onthankfully I'm sitting in this room it'smy second week on the jobum we're talking about you knowlaunching a new set of reports for thisproduct and people are talking aboutterabytes of data they're talking aboutyou know latency they're talking aboutall of these things words I hadn't heardbeforeum because I thought I wanted to be ateacher so I suddenly found myself inthis product management role andlistening to all these words and peopleare describing they have mocks they'reshowing all of these things on thescreen and I'm sitting there and I haveall these questions right I have thesequestions about like you know from thecustomer perspective I have questionsabout you know have they considered Xhave they considered why and I was sortof too intimidated to ask this which initself was a mind-boggling moment for mebecause I'm an incredibly outspoken ofus and there's not a thought that hasn'tleft my head and it's taken me years tofigure out like what to keep inside andwhat to sayum so it was it was really hard in thosemoments to have to control myself andhave this these moments of Doubt so Iwrote down these three questions and I'mwatching this meeting 13 14 people inthe roomand finally you know a couple of peoplein the room fairly Junior uh folk theywere like okay I have this question andI have this next question and they wereall the questions that I had and thatreally was my breakthrough moment waslike it does it didn't matter that Ididn't you know understand how thesedatabases were built it didn't matterthat I didn't understand like you knowhow the front end experience cametogether and none of it really matteredbecause if you go to the core of likewhat is the problem you're trying tosolve for whoever your you know customermight be like that's where you reallybring yourself to shine and and the AHAfor me was my non-technical backgroundwas actually a strength because it waspossible for me to sort of step outsideof the the uh what felt like you knowum chains of uh understanding theimplementation and feeling sort ofbeholden to building this the fastestway or the most expedient way or usingthe you know sexy this technologywhatever it is I didn't I none of thatmattered to me because I didn'tunderstand any of it but I could bringmy non-technical experience to bear inthat room and it also that the other ahawas really about being vulnerable to saywell look I don't understand what you'resaying when you say this is hard to dolike help me understand why this is hardto do help me understand the trade-offand the the thing that I've learned overthe years is that you know the more youpoke when something doesn't smell rightlike you got to keep poking therebecause there's definitely somethingwrong and this is very much the seesomething say something I think you knowand I I say this to everybody not justyou know women of color anyone and likeyou see you have to speak up becauseanything you're experiencing there'sprobably at least five others who areand it's our responsibility as asleaders and as a Builders of technologyto bring that to Bear agreed sodefinitely do not make vulnerability asyour weakness and make it as a strengthum I mean talking to the sharedexperiences like uh very similar to likea young and Mira I started in managementconsulting uh that is like coming from adifferent country from a differentbackground when you start in aprofession like Consulting especiallywhen you're hanging out going out with alot of customer dinners and everythingand not knowing enough about Americanculture uh resulted into a lot ofconversations where I am a veryoutspoken person like very outgoing butthere was a time when I was still tryingto understand and navigate theseconversations where I started to becomea little bit shy and like talk less andbecause I was like maybe the things thatI don't know I should not add value tolike I don't know if I should be askingthese questions very similar things soauthentic self and be more authenticrather than assimilating which I think Idid strong in a first year of my careeraround that but then finding people whohave gone through this learning fromother shared experiences definitely helplike okay if I don't understand AmericanSports we don't have to talk about it Ican just ask about maybe you like beeror wine I don't know like a differenttopic that more people feel inclusiveso instead of like trying to fit inwhich we all try to do no matter howmuch our consciously or unconsciousparade says that we kind of move towardsmore authentic selfum so I think the other thing we do talkabout uh is like Dei programs like we uheverybody at least now in day and agemost companies are trying to have a Deiunique story they're trying to figureout programs we have resources andstructure but that doesn't necessarilymean that it works for you and thatdoesn't necessarily mean that it likemight be valuable for youso we have got gone through a lot of Deistories together in the programs but wealso know like when two matureecosystems come together or bring thejourney there's a Better Together storylike anq side Rising tide lift all boatsum so I think would be also good for anaudience to understand how as companieswe partneredum and we each have a different story asto how we partnered and how we broughttogether just for the fact for thisaudience like I did not know a young andMeera before I started working with themand now we've built this relationshipthat we feel comfortable engaging inthis conversation and like trying tofigure out a story that where we canhelp more leaders or Inspire moreleaders as they take the path so maybeMira actually aeon how do you want totalk about like how to a sneerFoundation Google actually partneredthrough the Dei story yeah absolutelyand so this all started about a fewmonths ago it was actually duringwomen's History Month yeahum our lovely Google rep who owns a nearfoundation accountum with Google Cloud Colleen she invitedme to an eventum called an I am remarkable Workshop Ihad no idea what it was I walked inum not really having any expectationsand within 90 minutes at the close ofthe workshop I walked out like a changedperson and then I do not say thatlightlyum there's a lot ofI think we have a lot of stigmas aroundhow we talk about our accomplishmentsand that's exactly what the workshoptries tochange instead of us thinking aboutyou know self-promotion as a negativething as bragging how can we think aboutit as if I don't tell anyone how willthey know there's a lot of work thatgoes into our daily lives that peopledon't know or understand because theydon't see it and especially in a remoteworking environment like I work in web 3and web3 is mostly remote andum you know just being able to kind oftalk about your accomplishments that'sso important and soum yeah I walked out of the workshopthinking that was a phenomenalexperience and I really wanted to kindof share that and Colleen made a greatsuggestion suggested to bring it to nearand soum with ankita's support we brought theprogram to my like the near Foundationleadership team mainly our amazing Chiefpeople officer as well as our CEO bothof whom are women andum I just told them I think this is afantastic Workshop Google you know willshare this with their partners and wecan be one of them and so that's kind ofhow this journey started and here we areum yeah II just really think that being able toshare that resource was really helpfulbecause near Foundation we're a verysmall team but we are a globallydistributed ecosystem and we have peopleall over the world and I think thismessage is something that everyoneshould hear and um you know it I know itstarted out as a program geared towardswomen but eventually they open it up toeveryone because they realize this issomething that everyone should be ableto understand and really internalize soyeah and I'm just really excited becausewe've hosted a couple of internalsessions and we're hoping to take theworkshop to the ecosystem and soI'm very excited for the potentialsum those who don't know what I'mremarkable is it's like a Google adprogram where we do like a 90 minutesworkshop and it's open to all so it'snot just specific to gender or like aspecific race or ethnicity but reallythat's where one of the core things ishelping understand how to promoteyourself and be open aboutuh your achievements to a Young's Pointuh specifically coming from Asianculture we are not taught in fact we aretold to downplay a little bit of ourachievements because we it's more oflike skewed towards humbleness but it'smore of like okay you shouldn't betalking about over and over what you'velearned but that can be not very goodwhen you're having conversations withyour managers or even like you're tryingto even trying to figure out what youcan bring to the table so I think thatbrings a little bit of change in thatmindset and that's super helpfulespecially with web3 like web3 as a oneof the newer Advanced stack on theplatform ecosystem we're super excitedto help you scale I'm remarkableis a very different story like actuallythere are two parallel stories withTulio uh we did start and I'm aremarkable program we told you with 26iron remarkable workshops 172 to lionsbut I think uh just talking about methat I may be like how your specificproduct group and like how we like whatdoes the partnership with Google isaround diversity Dei actuallyexclusively and like giving stage towomen of color yeah absolutely ourrelationship didn't stop at all fromthat Workshop it was very much businessdriven uh um and we were trying to dosome work aroundsurprise Ai and lots of meetings youknow with googlers as well as twillionsin these meetings and I think it wasvery much from the get-go that Ankitaand I really hit it off because westarted to notice in the very firstmeeting how how much we had from ashared value perspective like Google andtwilio definitely their shared valuesbut at a personal level we found thatyou know there was a an immediateMeeting of Minds we wereaddressing the topics encouraging youknow folks in the audience to sort ofspeak up bring their you know diverseperspectives the quieter voices uh youknow people of all all colors everythingall the perspectives were valid theywere important this is an area where Ithink all of us knew enough to bedangerous but there was so much of theiceberg that still had to be exploredum but it was a truly a a symbioticpartnership where we were both sort ofaspiring to get all the voices godum and and it's been a great partnershipI have to say yep um I think to the tothe similar conversation I think and thepoint is like you don't have to adoptDei just how it is set up uh definitelylike there has been a lot ofadvancements and progresses to thestructure and framework consideringmultiple perspectives and diverseperspectives uh but it definitely startswith like for example I was in thisconversations meet and I were in theconversations where we were driving alot of technical conversations and Iremember a meeting where we hadengineering folks on the Google side andengineering and product folks in theTulia side and I don't remember exactlywho but somebody like skipped directlyto Mira's direct report thinking that'sthe person who's actually driving thedecisioning and Technical because Idon't know whether it was an unconsciousbias or an assumption that was made andI remember Mira like coming back withthat same perspective and what shetalked about before vulnerability is nota weakness of like kind of takingcontrol of the conversation but drivingit in a very productive way so everyonein that room feels included it doesn'thave to be just one opinion and it waskind of reverse mentoring for me or liketrying to understand the challenges soagain Dei can be applied it doesn't haveto be a concept of a checkbox ortraining it can be in your everyday withpeople you work people you share yourexperiences with and as a as the thecommunity that we represent here todaywomen of color it's kind of our partalso to enable people who areunconsciously not aware about certaincues again to give an examplewhen I started uh my career inspecifically in America I used to getthis a lot because I was a little bitkind of quieter when I started speakingso I earlier I used to maybe it's it'stotally unintentional they're justtrying to figure out and like clearlyhere but then I decided to like reallynot call them out but kind of like helpthem understand or like try myself aswell to be a little bit louder if it'smore clear for everyone again that'sjust different cues and like how you canfigure out when you work throughchallenges and experienceswe have 17 minutes left so I'll justcover one more question and wedefinitely want because this audience isdefinitely I think who relate with allwhat we're talking through so we wantyou guys to ask questions or even likeshare your storiesum so one last question both for you andGamera is we are talking to women ofcolors in Tech space right of courselike there's a lot bigger industryso how do you position how do youleverage your possession or role or theAuthority or even like your currentimpact in your organizationto support people of color or to haveDrive the Dei Focus to consider morediverse perspectiveum again I go back this goes backprobably a decade I was at a companywhereum every meeting started with you knowreading a document and I never thoughtanything of it like you know I studiedEnglish from when I was growing upkindergarten I think never thought I hadbeen doing it for many months beforethat and so there was this documentwe're all reading it and I start to getthese messages on my computer from thiscolleague a woman uh Amy Grant she hadjust moved to the country she's likethis document's dense there's really alot of information here uh you knoweveryone's finished reading it and Ihaven't and she's like I can'tcontribute to this conversation and itI have been as I mentioned had been youknow in this practice and neverquestioned it until that moment whenum she raised this question this is sortof I guess less of a woman of colorstory and more of a you knowneurodiversity challenge right sothere's it was it opened my eyes as wellto the fact that you know you might beyou might have people withum reading challenges as well in theroom and and we weren't taking any ofthose things into consideration bysaying this is the way this businessoperates it's we've all noticed thisright like we've seen every almost everyImplement is built for right-handedpeople uh you know you just assume thatthat's how the world operates so when Ithink about how do you bring thisperspective into you know the the workthat we do the tools we build I thinkit's it it is important to be inintentional to know and to help yourteams understand that the products thatwe build aren't just being used bypeople who look like us they're beingused by people who you know come in allshape sizes colors like you knowdifferent ways of thinking differentperspectives and soyou can't tell the perfect thing thatworks absolutely for everybody but howdo you consider more more and more ofthese perspectives to think about userexperience in a more inclusive way itwas also a thing that really opened myeyes to the importance of design intechnology and and design having a seatat the table like I'm sure all of youwork in in some form of like a technicalfield either directly or indirectly likeyou know a show of hands like how oftenis designed you know have a seat at thetable when you're designing or thinkingabout a productyeah so it is I I think that uh so thatthat's how I think about it and that'show in my role like I make sure that weare considering these things like I workon a product forcontact Centos so you know everyone hashad a support experienceum uh probably not the greatest one butwhen you flip and you think about theperson on the other end who's takingyour call like they're presented with aninsane amount of information right likeif it's a a fintech company whateverthey're looking at like who you you knowyou called why you calledum all your investments from before andall of these are disconnected systemsand this poor human has to stitch allthis information together while you'reprobably you knowtapping your pen on the table waitingfor them to give you the answer that youcalled forhow do we build products for to makesure that these support people are givenonly the information they absolutelyneed to answer your question right sothen you leave happy quickly and theyare also engaged in their role sothey're not put through this sort ofpersonal pain so it's like smallexamples like this but I think all ofthese things go a long way in terms ofthinking about the the diversity ofperspective and thoughtyeah um so honestly I think what Mirasaid just now is spot on so in my role Iget to Advocate advocate for developerswithin our ecosystemumand again one of the reasons why I madethis transition was because I wanted tobring in more diverse perspectivesum and one of thebest parts and also I think the hardestparts about being in web 3 is that itreally is a globalecosystem and in a way it's borderlessand so I think there's a lot ofopportunity to bring in more diverseperspectives and to encourage Buildersfrom non-traditional backgrounds tobecome involved because with morediverse I guess understanding of whatthe needs are out there and what theactual use cases can be we just create abetter ecosystemand I guess one example that like popsinto my head that I really feel like canbe solved with web3 is this idea offinancial stability and Independence youknow I have the privilege and I thinkmost people in Western societies havethe privilege of being able to accessum you know fairly Dependable financialinstitutions and also the ability tomanage my own finances not everyone hasthat ability I think the statistic I'veheard is there's about a billionunbanked people around the world many ofwhom are women and that just means thatthey don't have a way tokeep their money safe if they're evenallowed to actually have access to theirown financesum and you know obviously barring anycultural restrictions II don't see how giving those people theability to maintain their finances couldbe a bad thingum and kind of I guess like toround it out to one of the things thatwe touched on earlier I really dobelieve in a rising tide lifts all boatsand so if we're able to help peoplearound the world Achieve Financialstability or whatever else it may bemaybe feeling more empowered to talkabout their accomplishmentsum I I think that's the way to moveforward and yeah I think there's a lotwe can do yeah agreed and I thinkum like especially I remember youtelling the story the reason you tookthis role in developer advocacy is liketrying to give more opportunities tounderrepresentative developers uhwhether it's like leveraging theecosystem or like opening that up soum like to your point I think youmentioned that that almost billion orlike and most of them are women who donot have Financial Independence globallyso like having that in Dei of course isa second prior to them because they'restill trying to figure out so likehaving that opportunities as firstbefore even thinking about that is isimportantumI think one last question and then I'llmove on to audienceuh what would you say has been or Ithink what would be one keypiece of advicethat you would offer uh this group whichincludes women of color mostly that I'mseeing but also aresponsors or like our Network and peoplewho are at allies who do help us in kindof help us create the path as we wesucceed one advice each of youuh sure I think I think there's nosubstitute really for uh you knowbuilding expertise and whatever fieldyou're working in rightum but I think at the same time whileyou're working on gaining that expertisewhatever it might be whether you'reshifting roles changing verticalswhatever it is I think there's always alittle voice inside our heads that thatyour gut is telling you something andit's telling you something doesn't smellright trust it speak up ask questionslike do not be afraid toum you know or don't worry that it mightseem like a stupid question or too basicum it's always a valid question likethat that is is something that I live byand I absolutely believe that that'strue yeah agreed yeah and honestly againbuilding off of what Mary just said uh Ithink being able to speak up and notbeing afraid to speak up I guess fromfrom Mira's perspective it's about youknow if something seems off or you knowif there's some way you can contributeto something to make it better don't beafraid to speak up and I think kind ofgoing back to what I was talking aboutbefore don't be afraid to speak out orspeak up about what you believe inum what you've done to get to where youare and what you hope to accomplish andjust setting that sending that out intothe world I think can create a lot ofopportunities and I mean I'm a primeexample I wouldn't have gotten to thispoint if I didn't tell people that Iwanted to make this transition I've hadso many amazing mentors and Friendswho've helped me to get to this pointand again if I hadn't said anything theywouldn't have known so don't be afraidto talkI know we are over time thank you allwho made the time if there are no otherquestions we can let you go and againthank you again thank you"
