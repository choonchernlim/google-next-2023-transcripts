    "transcript": "foreign[Music]folks thanks for joining us today uhwhen I when I signed up for this sessionI didn't quite Envision this to be anopening act for Cool J but you know I'lltake the added pressure right but thanksagain for coming and uhwe're gonna be talking today about therise of data driven marketing but alittle bit of context right uhit's in the context of financialservices so some of you here are fromother verticals you know and otherverticals are probably a little moreadvanced because of you know lessregulations in the space if you willright I mean that's kind of one of themain reasons but we'll talk about it inthe context of financial services rightso before we dive in you know a littlebit of introductions you know I'marindam Chaudhary I lead the insightsand data practice which is essentiallyall things data and analytics forcapgemini for financial servicesbeing in the industry for you know 25odd years have been working you knowpretty much in the data managementconsulting banking space so very boringbut you know I did get to see theevolution of you know the datastrategies that banks have and I thinkthis topic is exciting becauseespecially if you think about it in thelast you know three four maybe fiveyears right we started seeing a lot ofshift towards you know marketing rightand focus on marketing in the banksespecially when they started feeling alot of heat or pressure let's say fromthe fintechs right uh who could you knowuh go Toe to Toe with them or sometimeseven surpass them in user experience andpersonalization right so Banks startedto react and respondand we're gonna talk about you know whatsome of those responses kind of looklike and uh you know uh and and howtechnology is helping right so that'skind of the theme I'm honored to bejoined by my friend and you know clientRaj maragulla he has uh he's a veteranbut he asked me to point out that he's ayoung veteran right so Raj over to youno thank you I mean thank you all formaking the session I'm sure everyone isenjoying the last two days as introducedme Raj modula what I do I run theconsumer data technology for Consumerdata products and analytics what doesthis mean I'm sure we all must havereceived offers in mail for a car loan ahome loan and somebody's shopping for acollege loan recently I got my daughterinto college I started getting you knowcollege loan applications whymy neighbor is not getting that sothat's where we're going to talk moredeeper as we get into the conversationabout consumer data and marketing andhow we could really inform on it right alittle bit of background on my side uhI'm sure like to start off I was born ina remote island in India I'm sureeveryone has seen in the news last weekabout India's lands to moons so I wasfrom the land of rocket science butchoose computer science but landed ondata science so I've been trying to dodata science for the last 25 years andhere I am with arindam to you know sharemy experience and also have a probably aproactive engaging conversation rightthank you right so the topic today isyou know the modern customer journey andthe rise of data driven marketing rightso the way I think about it and why thisis kind of exciting ismanifold right one I think you know thethe realization that the banks have orevery organization has is to you knowpersonalize their message to the clientsright at the same time and and clientsare expecting you know more personalizeduh you know interactions from theinstitutions that they work with but atthe same time they're also concernedabout data privacy right so how do youactually you know provide thatpersonalized service right it itrequires you bringing in a lot of datafrom a lot of different places into aone common you know Central platform ifyou will so you know uh the industryterminology you know nowadays is youknow customer data platform or CDP as itis known why it is exciting is becauseit is literally the last data platformwithin the institution before you reachout to the customer so a lot of actionhappens in that platform right so youneed to bring in data for you knowtransaction data your interaction datayou know product Masters rightbehavioral data you can you need tocreate you know smart segments you needto apply Ai and machine learning so thatyou generate some real-time insights tofeed those personal personalized offersand then you activate those offersacross different channels right sothat's what we're going to talk abouttoday and that's what you know most ofour clients you know they have been onthat Journey so Raja I'd like to ask youlike you know coming from a big Bankwhat's your perspective and what hasyour journey been like yeah I mean thejourney has been evolving and prettylearning and with regulations right uh Imight be preaching to the call I meanthe data before the 2008 subprimes anddata after that is a completelydifferent Paradigm regulations you knowviolations or compliance legal audit allof those really ticked up the ante ondata and that's where the financialservices and the data enablement forbusiness or the consumers right hascompletely gone into a different set ofchallenges uh set off you knowconstraints set of you know regulationsthat we have to meet onone of the biggest challenges we've seenyou know as we Embark this journey is uhyou know the data strategy I'm sure asall nations evolved for various reasonsright the data has been Federated atvarious places and the Federated couldnot just be in the data assets point ofview right I mean it also could bebecause on the tech stack I mean beforethis conversation I was listening to andtalking to Jack moff who runs our Googleuh Financial Services he shared a veryinteresting perspectivewhile we were talking on genaa andthings right what he said was 44 of the50 leading Banks you know are still onmainframes Janae has made tremendousimpact on Splash in the last six to ninemonths but if you look at theinfrastructure and Investments you needand the processes of the Legacyprocesses you know which have beensuccessfully running that's where theadoption of it would be the next set ofchallenges we look at if you reallybring it back to where we are you knowin the Wells Fargo point of view rightwe have made tremendous Journey on datasince to in the last five to six yearswhere we have taken elements ofcentralization of data and also enablingwhat we call as data runways I mean thedata Runway could nothing but main wehave the customer information we knowwhat you need and we really have createthat personalization and you knowenablement of offers to you right bringthe data to the customers versus youknow the manual or the other channelsthat we have been using onokay beautiful and and coming back tothe theme of CDP righthow how does Wells think about it I meanbecause while there are you know someplatform providers who are vendors whosell you a CDP solution and uh I I haveseen some challenges okay one is youknow it's a customer data platform and Ithink a lot of times people tend tounderestimate the data part of it okaywhen you're bringing in all yourtransactional data all your product dataall your interaction data right clickdata external data and and you knowbringing it at scale running AI on itand provide you know real-timerecommendations that requires a dataplatform yeah it just happens to be acustomer data platform right so sopeople are also building you know morecomposable cdps leveraging you knowplatforms uh like Google so so what'scan you shed some light on that on howyou guys are thinking about that noabsolutely right I mean definitely justas any other financial institutionsright the data Journey starts on on-prembecause cloud from its Evolution towhere it it is right now it's moreacceptable and and the penetration ofcloud into Financial Services on uptakecompared to three years or five yearsback the way we are looking at is uh youcan always look at it as centralizationof data as a customer data I mean the abasic classification of what's thedifference between a customer and aconsumer isif somebody has a home loan he's aconsumer of that particular productsomebody has a auto loan he's a consumerof that particular product but if I takea customer you know a customer isnothing but a consumer of variousproducts in the bank that's exactly whatI mean by the centralization of dataonce we necessarily have that right wecouldn't necessarily Target a targetedoffer or launching a product or run acampaign on top of that right so that wecould really understand the profile of aparticular customer with variousproducts and their interests and on topof it right I won't call the icing onthe cake on top of it you add the creditreport which everybody has access to wereally are informed about what's acustomer 360 view so that we couldreally drive a particular product for acampaign or Target uh population yeahand no I think that sounds soundsamazing right so uhif if I were the CMO uh you know I wouldask like okay sounds great right buthave you have you you know tried out anyuse cases yes right so do you have anyyou know success stories that you couldprobably share with the audienceabsolutely thank you for bringing thatquestion in them um recently this ispublic newsum uh consume a small business lawbusiness banking we've launched what wecall as uh Flex flows this went in liveback in uh it was a Charlie initiativeback in before Thanksgiving what doesflex loans mean right necessarily if youGoogle up Banking and the overdraft feesright that's a that's a very hot topicyou could find a lot of blogs I meanwith lot of passionate opinions on theoverdraft fees and how painful that isso one of the key things was to launchuh what we call as a flex loans whichcould necessarily provideidentify consumers or customers with anoverdraft history and then necessarilyprovide them a short-term loan with itwith a one flat fees the loans couldvary from 250 or 500 with a flat feesand that was launched in in Thanksgivingand I've really related back to ourIndians question right the first launchof it of how did it help the CMO thefirst launch of it was very targetedfriends and family so that we couldprove the product out and later on rightwe ran a campaign on top of that amarketing campaign is you solicit or youreach out to Consumers to say that thisoffer exists right I mean that's exactlywhere it went back to the CM was toguide that you could run a campaign andlet's see what happens to the loans veryquickly you know we've seen that once acampaign was wrong the loan adoptionrate has has tremendously went up by 10to 20 x timesnow in doing so what we necessarily doflip it back to the CDP side of thingsright we centralize the data we ran anoffer we went back to campaign butthere's a lot that turns in betweenright there are elements ofuh we got to get consent of theconsumers right so there are variousutilities or engines which run on thecentralized data to ensure that we havethe consent of the consumers to reallyreach out to them we have various otherutilities like the eligibility criteriaif we are necessarily you know deeming aperson uh eligible for a particular loanthat decision should be auditabletraceable and risk analyzed but at thesame time right there is a certaincriteria with the CMO could decide onhow to Target the laws right well that'sa brilliant example right and it is youknow you actually saw the ROI in a veryshort period of time right yeah so sowhen you guys launch the campaign rightuh did you was it an omni Channel youknow kind of did you go across multiplechannels and maybe just build on thatand talk a little bit about what is theimportance of omni channel in today'sworld I mean it's pretty important rightbecause when we necessarily have thechannels of communication you you couldlook at an email you could look atonline you could look at various bankerand tellerways right I mean this wasmore of an email campaign we targeted sonecessarily based on a particular usecase or Target population right you knowCMO decides what a channel tonecessarily use at now if you reallyflip back to the problem statement ofyou know CMO and CDP right I mean thelast five years the concepts of CDPwhile they're evolving the concept of Dand piano evolved as well so they alwaysthe industry always saw the consumer andmarketing has two different platformsbut with the journey evolving right theycannot be separated they are dependenton each other right right so that'swhere right the choice of channels thechoice of Target population and thatreally was an evolution in The Last FiveYears on the street which we have I'mvery proudly say that we've taken atremendous step forward towards thatyeah and and I think you know yourindustry and particular he saw a seachange after the pandemic or during thepandemic right so you know one solutionif it was when it came around the firsttime it was probably a little early tothe market was you know the wholejourney analytics yes right and you knowuh so those companies did did some workand then you know they kind of wentunder a little bit right in under theradar but they're back right and youknow looking at customer Journeys andyou know wire might be some of thepotential kind of pitfalls or where dothey kind of typically drop off or youknow when people switch between channelsseamlessly continuing the sameconversation with them becomes veryimportant right and and it is absolutelycritical to customer satisfaction now Iknow Raj you feel pretty passionatelyabout you know conversational AI so howdo you see conversation AI kind of fitin into this space and then you knowpowered by you know I have to saysomething about Jane AI so powered byJane AI how does that change without isa very intriguing question the lot ofviewpoints rightum and again latest and greatestGathering lot of data from last two daystoo right considering the Synergy andenergy on AI in the last six monthswhere a concept and more pragmaticrealization and what's from theannounced yesterday on the TPU gpusright a lot of excitement thereto that point right if you reallytranslate that back into realizing theconcept of capabilities available infintech to Banks right what comes inbetween regulationsso how does how does you knoworganizations deal with you knowenhancing our adoption or operationsoperationalizationor contextualization of this particularconcept of AI right there are variousways to look at it one way to look at itis if you look at the diagram here rightand and what I articulated beforethe the fact that is CDP there iscentralization of data I'm sure you canalways think that in on all theautomations when you centralize this lotof Federated data assets Master data sothere are various Federated systems ofdata where the data flows throughso you you look at conversation as a onepragmatic use case is you know Targetinternal uhI.T side of operations right an elementof that could be where is my data that'sa perennial challenge that's a perennialyou know pain Point lot of ourbusinesses have where is my data right Imean some organizations and haveautomated ways of finding it someorganizations you're lucky you know onehour seven people ten people you couldfind where the data is to find that thedata is not there so that's exactlywhere I read a conversation AI which hasthree pillars of fundamental right whichis your natural language processing yourdata and process but if you have data infirst place right you could necessarilyenable natural language processing andthen you process and metadata aroundprocess okaynow coming back to the CMO right uhwhat others you know Roi indicators canyou think of you know I you and I talkedabout paid media right and how tooptimize that maybe talk about that alittle bit yeah definitely I mean paidmedia is another fascinating you knowtopic uh and a pain point a lot oforganizations are going through and alot of evolution is happening there justto step back from it and if a newcontextually give a problem statementright when we started the data journey Istarted my data Journey long time backstill learning about it there was anelement of operational data rdbms wedealt with a cybase Oracle with timethere came the notion of analytical dataof course transactional data alwaysexistedbut with time what the evolution ofInternet you know like keywords such asyou know the ads campaigns what hasreally evolved as a theme is thebehavioral dataall the organizations you know andaverage they spend anywhere from 400 to6 or 400 to 600 million in paid mediaanalytics for campaign running andrunning ads whether it's a Hulu adwhether it's YouTube whether it's onlinethere's so much of that happening on itcoming back to arundel's question rightif the measurement of metrics on andeffectiveness of a campaign of X dollarspent right is is a key metric everyautomation is going after there arevarious Vehicles there are various thereare million ways to skin a cat but thechallenge is underlying are the firstparty second party and the third partydata right and that's exactly how dataevolved into with evolution of internetand the ads and other social mediacampaigns but that's where we see thatyou know paid media analytics is atremendous problem to be solved anopportunity for all the financialinstitutions yeah so definitely you knowjust doing the ROI analytics and reallyseeing like where you're getting themost bang for your buck yes right so Iknow that's that's a good point I what Iwas also thinking about yesterday rightwhen the uh Google and build the searchgenerative experienceand you know it's just going to changethe search engine you know the landingpage right dramatically right and and soyou can't you know the traditionalmodels of you know SEO and you know semis going to change right so havingcontrol through a platform you knowwhich lets you create more personalizedcontent which can be put out there isgonna become absolutely key right ifyou're doing it in five different placesit's got to be that much harder to dobut you you know if you have like acentralized platform right uh it it atleast it's you know it's much morecontrollable rightso so to that end Raj how do you I meanyou know you guys are working closelywith Google right can you tell us alittle bit more about you know whatcomponents of Google that you areexploring you know and you find the mostinteresting to work with in the comingcouple of years definitely right lookingat the Google tech stackum a few things that have been veryfascinating interesting also isdefinitely the capabilities of paidmedia analytics and the second partydata that they could necessarily help usTarget with and also you look atelements of moving analytical oroperational capabilities into Googleright or vertex a sits right there andwhat excited me in after this conferencewas the way they are getting what text awith Enterprise search capabilities howthey're complementing that with tpu'sgpus which could be on your on-prem datacenter I mean it's it's it's fascinatingexciting at the same time I mean a lotof effort and cost will be involved buthow having said that right uh you knowyou look at the Google bigquery if yougo from left to right right Googlebigquery you dataplex the capabilitiesthat come with uh Google are pretty muchoverlapping with what we necessarilyneed as a capabilities we have one thingI before I close out my answer on thatis you know the other key thing which weare still exploring is what are theother you know SAS offerings wenecessarily can have on the marketplaceI was in a session uh this morning inthe same room where they were talkingabout Google cloud and sovereignty rightum I think uh an element that caught methere was the data marketplace wherethey were advertising you know orproclaiming the offerings as isavailable elasticsearch is availableonline DB has definitely triggered someinterest you know when I pursuedyesterday so that's exactly where we seeset off needs Necessities uh to move theneeded on the financial side and the setof capabilities where we see a Synergyin the multi-years in your head okay andand the foundational models that you getas part of you know vertex AI right doyou envision using some of thosefoundational modelsI think anything foundational right andthe reusability uh it will be a a quickvalue add to the time to Market but uhthe contextuality to a particular lineof business and adoption right I thinkthat's the learning we need to have so Ithink that's where I see the Journey ofwhere the nfrs or the non-functionalsouthern the technical capabilitiescould give us enough flip but we reallyhave to go back and see you know how wecould match it down to customization tomeet the needs yeah well makes sense seeI think you know you you brought up aninteresting point about first partysecond party third party data as wellright and uh I think if if I look atBanks today there are also at least alot of the large banks that we aretalking to we they are also kind ofthinking about what is the next cohortof potential customers they can go afterright and these could be you know peoplewho don't have much of a credit historyso you know relying on just the CreditBureau report is not enough right so forexample you know if a kid is going tocollege and they walk into a bank toopen an accountsometimes you know they are turned awaybecause you know for whatever reasonright some technicality but little dothe banks realize that they probablylost a lifetime Customer because howoften do you change your bands back youdon't right you know it's like you knowyou if you have a checking account youhave your first savings account you endup taking a mortgage and then when youhave kids you know you take studentloans you deal with the same bank rightso it's a multi-year relationship sobanks are also concerned about how theybring in people with you know thin ornon-existent credit files rightand and you know they're looking at morecreative ways to drive trade decisioningand bringing in more you knowunstructured data uh you know behavioraldataum you know demographic data to kind ofinform those credit decisions right nowthe beauty of a platform like CDP isthat again you can bring all of thesedata together that's good to drive yournext best offer the next best actionas a matter of fact you know we've beenonly talking about you know the CMO usecases but once you create this dataUniverse you know it's not justmarketing use cases your use cases couldbe around personalization it could bearound fraud detection right you knowthere's so many The Avenues are likeunlimited rightthat's a great fascinating topic so Ithink you know the Raj one question Ihave is uhwhen you talk about you know first partysecond party third party data there is alot of talk about you know creating dataclean rooms yes yeah so could you uhperhaps share with the audience you knowwhat what is the concept and what is theneed behind your data clean roomabsolutely right I mean data clean roomuh is an evolving topic uh at the sametime if I really classify the data asfirst party which is owned by aparticular institution and second partywhich is all everything hosted withinon-prem and you necessarily have thesecond classification which is thesecond party data which is owned by theinstitution but it's out there on thepublic domains and the third party datais you could not be your customers orcustomers or consumers it's your broaderprospects which could be probably thebroader U.S population if thatclassification is there right the needforevery ordination is has a Targetconsumer population you and everyorganization could get a PotentialProspect information but are we allowedto merge this data in one place rightbringing that data together is afascinating unlocking the power of moreRevenue but it comes with you knowconstraints the constraints are do wehave the data contracts do you own thedata the ownership of data is much moretighter than the ownership of oil inMiddle East these days right so that'sexactly where the concept of clean roomhas come in where you could necessarilyanonymize the data and you're allowed tonecessarily bring your first party orsecond party and the third party datatogether in a very contained and Governof governed ways so that one the dataand the value that can be unlocked fromthe various three parties of data at thesame time it's not violating anypolicies of you know privacy orrevealing user identities or any Biainformation so that's exactly where theclean room concept is coming is evolvinginto a very big value add to our Nationsto unlock the rois unpaid media so toreally start enhancing their marketingcampaigns so that it's more targeted andbroadly reachable okay and and uhis Google providing certain capabilitiesfor you to help build this clean room weare definitely you know exploring pathswith Google where we could necessarilyhave their clean room capability withcontractual obligations to be adoptedfor you know some of the capabilities orenablement we are trying to do for thecsbb line of business to bring marketingand the consumer data and the rois tothe next next you know one two three orfile Finance up yes okaycool so I think you know we we havethree more minutes so I'll ask you onelast question right so you guys havebeen on this journey for a few yearsright and as with every largeorganization I'm sure there would besome missteps and then you know you goback and you correct yourself right soif you were giving advice to Raj youknowof three years ago what would thatadvice be I thought you would ask 25years back docket science versus datascience but jokes I said right yes Imean two years ago if I had to go backand relook at it right I mean we wouldhave thought about you knowprobably some of the links on thebehavioral data was learnings to us someof the scale of what we were gettinginto on the data of centralization itwas alerting to us right becausescintillation we always see incentralization and I have personality incentralization at various areas likeI've seen trading systems I thoughtthat's when the volume could be thelargest nobody nowhere else but the rootlearning I had when we started bringingconsumer data CDP together was how itintegrates closely with the datamanagement platform on the marketingside and how deep and Broad we reallyhave to run your aggregations and that'swhere we had our learnings we had ourgray hairs but we that's one thing Icould have done probably a bit moredeeper due diligence on okay thank youthanks for sharing that Rajforeign"
