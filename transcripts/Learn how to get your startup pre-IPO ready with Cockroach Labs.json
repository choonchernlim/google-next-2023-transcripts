    "transcript": "good morning everyone uh for just comingin go ahead and find your seats uh myname is uh Ben Darnell the uh co-founderand Chief Architect at uh cockroach Labsum and today I'll be talking about ourjourney from uh from starting our ourcompany to uh to being on a on a trackfor for an eventual IPO um so we're herein the startup Lounge um we're uh I'mhere not at cockroach Labs is here notas a uh not as a a current startup wewe're an eight-year-old company um we'remaking cockroach DB the uh thedistributed uh SQL database and uh we'rehere to kind of come back as alumni ofthe uh of the Google startup program toshare some lessons we've learned alongthe way um so that you can uh you canmaybe learn uh learn some things thatyou can apply in your own startups umfrom our our successes and maybe some ofour our mistakes that we've uh made aswell um so this talk is going to beorganized in into uh three phases ofyour of your company's life cycle umfirst uh we're going to talk about goingfrom zero to one or nothing to somethingthis is the kind of the earliest mostintense phase of of a startup's lifewhen you're trying to uh build somethinguh build something both a team and aproduct from scratch um and I want Iwant to actually back up a second umwe're the makers of cockroachdb thistalk is not about cockroachdb it's aboutuh it's about our our company and thejourney that we've taken so um if you'reinterested in DB please do find usin the hall outside this session or goto our booth in the main uh in the mainExpo area um but uh in this uh in thishalf hour we'll just be talking about uhabout the company and not uh and not theproduct because you really are buildingtwo separate things when you're making astartup you're building the uh buildingyour product but you're also buildingthe company that's going to um be ableto scale and sustain the uh the productso stage one you're going from uh fromsomething to from nothing to somethingum for in state phase two um we can kindof label 0 to 1 to 10 these are not youknow meaningful numbers they're justkind of uh to get the general idea oforders of magnitude uh scaling steps butin the in the one to 10 stage you're uhyou're taking your first your firstcohort of users your first uh you knowversion one of your product and tryingto make that uh get get some repetitionsout of that to find uh find really whereyou where you fit in the market and thenphase three for going from 10 to 100it's all about taking the lessons thatyou learned in the earlier phases andthe products and uh and organizationsthat you've built and and really scalingthat out um and and building it out tosomething that can that can go to to amassivescale um so starting out in Phase Onegoing from from nothing to something umwhat what do you do when you just havean idea and you want to get you want touh make that make that into into areality um so of course this is this isa very uh very risky process um startwith some kind of dismal statistics touh maybe set the uh set the mood um morethan 90% of startups failum according to the startup GenomeProject um and then even of the of theones that succeed well what does whatdoes success look like well one of theone of the forms that success can takeis is an acquisition um and I've had theGood Fortune to be a part of of three uhthree Acquisitions in my in my career atvarious startups um all of them happenvery early on um and as you see in uh inthis chart um Acquisitions can be uhmost of the Acquisitions that happenactually happen uh very early on evenpre uh pre-series a um and when you lookat these these acquisition numbersthey're kind of a kind of a mixedblessing um they can be a very good uhFinancial outcome for the uh for thefounders and employees of these startupsbut in an awful lot of cases these uhreally are an exit in the sense thatyou're shutting down your uh yourproduct that you uh you know poured youruh years of your life into um in uh andset and you know picking up starting towork on on a new project assigned by theby the acquiring company um all allthree of the Acquisitions that I've beenthrough have been more um Aqua hires orTalent Acquisitions than um thanAcquisitions for the product and thoseproducts were all promptly uh promptlyshut down so if you're uh if you're inthis for the Long Haul um you know onceyou get past uh series uh D or E uhlevels of funding then your company kindof gets too uh too big for um for for anacquisition and so you're really lookingat at an IPO as your uh as your biggestuh biggest target for your main targetfor for an exit so with that that inmind if you're wanting to build for thefor for the Long Haul instead ofsomething that's going to uh going toflip relatively soon um what do you whatdo you need to do as you're as you'restarting your company um for most of usstarting a uh company is going to be isgo going to have to involve fundraisinguh fairly early on um so what uh what doyou need to do when you're uh whenyou're looking for your initial uhinitial fundraising this could be a Serseed or series a um different differentapproaches depending on your yourstartup and what uh what what you needas far as how much how much capital howmany people uh things like that butwhatever you start with um you shouldlook at your early uh your earlyinvestors as as advisers and partnersand not just a source of money um youryour early investors are likely to endup on your board of directors they'relikely to stay there for quite a longtime um cockroach Labs um our first uhour first investor was a benchmark ourfirst round was led by Benchmark capitaland our partner at Benchmark is still onour on our board of directors todayeight years later and he's been uh oneof our most valuable uh partners andadvisers throughout the whole process areally good investor can uh provide waymore value than just the uh just themoney that they uh that they bring inand so when you're considering your uhyour investor options you should reallyum you know be I I would recommend beingwilling to compromise on a lot of thefinancial terms in order to get the bestuh the best partner and and adviser forthe for the longterm um early on uh if you've just gotan idea that's uh that's a great startbut you know it's it's not uh thatthat's you know ideas are cheap um we'veall heard the saying um it's uh 10%inspiration and 90% perspiration um andthat's certainly part of it here youhave your you need your idea and thenyou need to put in the Blood Sweat andTears to make it a reality but even thatis not enough um because if you're justuh even if you even if you've got thebest execution in the world you may beaiming uh to the to the wrong spot umyou may uh you may not be going wherethe uh where the market uh needs you toto be and so you need to have a Visionthat uh can tell you guide you where towhere you uh where you need to be whereyou're going to find your your Marketsuccess and uh and so this is a you knowyou can call it a vision or a you knowmy co-founder Spencer calls it the willto power you need something Beyond justuh but just an idea and and execution umyou know to to really be be successfuland be able to take a take a startup toto IPO uhscale um another thing that's importantto think about from the uh from theearliest days of your startup is yourcompany's culture um and culture issomething that uh that you may not maynot put put a lot a lot of thought intoum at some of my uh some of the previousstartups that I've worked at um you knowwe didn't um and uh you know you'll havea culture whether you plan for it or notit's just a question of what thatculture is uh is going to be um and youneed to it's important to be uh to bereally intentional about that um one ofthe uh failure modes that I that I'veseen for this is um you know at uh so souh our hosts here at Google uh famouslyhave a very uh very generous corporateculture that uh you know re revolvesaround lots of perks um lots of thingsthat kind of keep employees at theoffice um free uh free food uh lunch anddinner uh you know even laundry servicesat the office um and when we were uhwhen uh we were starting uh our ourstartup viewfinder in New York City weknew that we didn't want uh you knowthat that wasn't the right culture forus you know no one wants to do theirlaundry at the office in New York Cityeveryone's commuting by Subway it justdoesn't make any senseum but uh you know we uh and so you knowwe looked at a you know a culture thatwe tried to you know we thought ourculture was just going to be okayeveryone you know comes to the officeworks hard goes home at the end of theend of the day they can have dinner withtheir kids um or whatever they whateverthey want to do and um and so we didthat and we thought we thought we weredoing okay but we ended up with a very avery fragile company in the sense thatyou know we weren't forging those uhsocial ties within the within thecompany that would uh that would enableus to uh to survive the the inevitablerough spots that occur um and so withwith cockroach Labs we uh we were muchmore deliberate about it um we had seenthat uh we we'd seen that rocky roadbefore and so we tried to uh to toinvest more in in building a culture getyou know with Team uh Team ski trips umyou know weekly team team dinners and uhand things like that to try and bringpeople uh bring people closer togetherand make it a much more um much morepleasant and satisfying place to work umthese days the big question aroundculture is uh you know are you going tobe in an office or remote or some kindof hybrid um and I'm not here to saywhat the what the right answer is we'restill uh still kind of navigating a lotof uncertainty in the space ourselves umbut you know again it's important thatyou you know have a have a thesis aboutwhat what kind of culture you want anduh and build for itdeliberately um finally part of a bigpart of our culture at cockroach Labs isuh we believe in uh being uh generouswith with equity in the people that arejoining us on this uh on this journey umyou think it's one of the one of thebest tools you have as a as a Founderfor uh for aligning incentives andgetting uh getting everyone everyone onboard um there's uh you know but it'salso it's something that's not talkedabout as much as uh as you know cashcompensation and it's difficult to tocompare across companies and so wewanted to make sure that we had a way ofallocating Equity across our across ourearly employees that was going to be uhgoing to be fair um we didn't go all theway as some uh some companies go withwith radical transparency and actuallypublishing all these details but wewanted to to design our our our processso that if it were to become public thatit would be um reasonable and defensibleto all of our all of our employees so wecame up with a very very quantitativeway of doing this uh we built a formulakind of a simple exponential decay umbased on someone's sequence in the uh inthe in the hiring order uh as a as amultiplier giving a multiplier to theirlevel so that the earliest employees gotum got a a multiplier to their uh totheir Equity allocation that uh thatthat reflected the extra risks they tookby coming on in you know the firstcouple of months instead of uh insteadof later on in the in the process and wewere aiming to hit some some roughbenchmarks um you know the first 20employees would get 10% of the equitythe next 20 would have 5% and and soon um so that's uh uh that uh concludesmy uh my talk about the the phase one ofof growth but so now now we're moving oninto the into phase that uh for growthand scale where uh we're going from from1 to 10 um so here you've got your firstyour first cohort of users you'restarting to get some feedback from themarket and now you want to make surethat uh that what you have uh is thatyou didn't just get lucky with yourfirst few customers you've got to beyou've got something that you can uh youcan repeat and uh and bring to uh bringto Market at a largerscale so the uh the thing that's uhthat's absolutely critical to keep inmind in this phase and something that uhthat we struggle with at uh at cockroachLabs is that you really got a Nar in ona focus you can't you can't speak to EVto every customer every potentialcustomer at once um you know because ifyou try to speak to everyone you'respeaking to nobody and this is somethingthat we found really challenging at uhat cockroach Labs because um our productcockroach DB is a is a SQL databaseevery business in the world uses SQLdatabases so we thought well we'rebuilding for for everybody that's ourbiggest possible um addressable Marketum and that is you know kind of in theend in the end game that's where we wantto be but when you're going from youknow your first uh your first customerto your to your T you can't you can'tspread your efforts too thin you've gotto you've got to really narrow in on uhon uh who you're building for who'sgoing to be delighted with your productin spite of all the limitations that itstill has because it's you know versionone or version two and it's not you knowyour your competitors who have had maybea 30-year head start onyou so one of the uh one of the waysthat this uh that this came up for us isthe uh the the uh difference betweenbuilding a cloud service versus a uh anopen source or even a closed Sourceproduct that people download and hostthemselves um this was a um these days Ithink this would be a fairly easyquestion um everyone is very uh veryenthusiastic about adopting the cloudfor everything um but but eight yearsago it was very much an open question umwhen uh when and whether uh bigcompanies were going to be ready to uhto use a a cloud hosted database as a asa primary system of record and so um wewe started out as a well we started outas an open source project for one thingum but we also also you know uh startedout as a product that you would uh woulddownload and host yourself on your ownuh on your own Hardware or on your ownvirtual machines um and that was uh youknow I can't say that was a mistake umbecause the uh because the market wasn'tready for a uh transactional database asa as a cloud hosted service yet um butuh you know in retrospect it's uh or ifwe're starting again in 20123 we woulddefinitely be uh looking more at thecloud and then the other thing welearned uh doing this the hard way isthat we thought that uh that doing botha cloud service and an open sourcedownload product would be uh would bemuch more complimentary to each otherthan they than they were we thought thatwe'd be able to build our open sourceproduct and then oh it would be a simpletask to go run that as a cloud serviceor you may look at it the other way andsay well we'll build a uh build a cloudservice and then we'll just package upparts of that and then uh and then sellit to customers who aren't ready for thecloud um that turned out to be uh wayharder than it uh than it looked um it'sreally you know going down that route isreally building two completely differentuh two completely different businessesyou've got different uh different coststructures different go to marketmotions um you know there's um much lessoverlap between the two uh between thetwo models than uh than we had we hadanticipated um and so again this is andthat's and that uh that division of ofattention is really uh really difficultto manage while you're still trying tofind your footing in the market so umyou know again even if you even if youthink what you're what you're cutting isis a big potenti market for the futureit's always better I think at this stageto stay uh stay narrowly focused on uhon where you can where you can win andwhere where you can uh make yourcustomers um thehappiest um this is also generally thephase when you're starting to uhstarting to build out your uh your go tomarket function especially if you are asas we were um a company with uhco-founder co-founders who all came froma from a technical background um you'vegot uh you've got your uh your yourproduct built and now you've got you gotto sell it um you know your yourfounding team is is likely to beinvolved in in all your early Sal yourearliest sales um because you you knowthe product better than anybody and forthe success of your company you need toknow your customers better than anybodytoo um but you know sales is very much aspecialized skill as well and uh youknow if you're an engineering founder umyou're probably uh not going to be uh assuccessful as you could be if you gointo uh go into sales calls directly soyou're going to want to going want tobuild out your sales team and you'regoing to want to start with uh withsomeone who's a a Hands-On um Hands-Onaccount executive or or similar uhsimilar kind of experience at at a smallearly stage company ideally um becauseyou want someone who's going to befocused on execution and not necessarilysomeone who's going to be you know thebest sales manager or VP of sales or croum so this early sales sales leader umthey may be someone that only you knowis the right fit for your journey for acouple of years and that's that's okayyou may need to um replace them withsomeone with uh you know a different uhdifferent skill set later on which I'lltalk about in in a few minutes um butyou know at this at this stage of thegame what you need what you need most issomeone who can do the uh do theHands-On um the Hands-On selling uhselling work and uh this this personneeds to be um needs to have a very uhCurious and experimental mindset they'llbe going out into the market um thatyou're trying to develop kind of fromscratch they've got to see you see whatworks and what doesn't and help you uhhelp you uh narrow in your focus onwhat's going to what's going towork um finally um another thing to keepin mind in this uh in this stage is youwant to make uh you know if you if youstarted out hiring uh the investors thatare going to be the the best advisers umthat then you want to make sure thatyou're getting that value out of themand one of the main channels for thatare your are your board meetings um aboard meeting is a great opportunity uhonce a quarter to uh to take stock inwhere things are going um we write up auh a board briefing document everyquarter quar um it's maybe six or eightpages long um includes a summary ofeverything that's going on in thecompany what our goals are for the nextquarter what our uh key results are foruh how we'll know that we're that we'reMeeting those goals and we've got theseuh these documents uh dozens of them nowgoing back uh going back years where wecan kind of track the progress of the ofthe uh of the company um these documentshave been a useful byproduct we've beenable to show them to other uh otherinvestors doing their uh doing their duediligence or to uh or to um executive uhnew executive hires to see uh See thetrack that we've uh that we've been onum and so just uh and just stopping toto reflect on the uh on the state of theof the business is uh uh can be can bereally valuable in its own right um inthe board meetings themselves um it'spretty typical at at this stage for acompany to have a five-person board umwith two seats reserved for theinvestors um two seats for uh forcompany insiders and a uh and a third uha fifth independent board seat um yourinvestor uh as I said are great advisersthey've seen a lot of things theyhaven't done as much generally or ifwhat they have done they've done uhfurther in the past um so you know thatfifth independent board seat can be agood place to uh to bring on a boardmember who does have more Hands-Onoperational experience um and especiallysomething that uh that complement yourco-founders um so you know someone whohas more experience in uh in sales ormarketing if your Founders are are fromengineering um or maybe someone withmore more of a technical background ifyour if your Founders are more businessoriented um but you know it's it can bea good way to improve the uh thediversity of perspectives on your onyour board and get a uh get get acommitted adviser with a different uhdifferent set ofexpertise um another thing that uh thatyou can think about here that uh doesn'tseem to be very common but has workedvery well for us is to think about uhwho's going to be on the board from thecompany um or your your commonrepresenting your common stockholders umit's most traditional for this to be uhtwo of your Founders um but often uhyour Founders are have similarbackgrounds um in our case we uh youknow we're all we're all Engineers weall spent substantial portions of ourcareer at Google um it's not the not notthe most diverse perspective it's notthe you know it's not very useful havinguh two of us in the room or on on theboard um and so we uh we decided that wewould uh that our second uh co-founderon the board would would step down givethat board seat to our chief productofficer um who uh you has has a verydifferent background and uh and we thinkthat was uh that was actually a reallygood move having bringing hisperspective into the uh into theboardroom um was uh you know a big uhbig step forward in our uh the operationof our of our board meetings and the andthe value that we're that we're gettingout of them so this is uh something thatuh I I don't see uh I haven't seen uhnearly as much as I would as I wouldexpect given how uh how uh how well itworked out for us but it's it'sdefinitely something worth worthconsidering um so moving on to uh tophase three um this is uh this is whereyou're really uh really on the runwaytrying to get your uh trying to get theplane to take off um you've got uhyou've got a uh uh you got an idea ofwho your ideal customers are and your uhyou've got your sales motion worked outum your your first first phase of uh ofsales anyway and now you've got toyou've got to figure out how you'regoing to you know scale this to uh to toyou know bring in the revenue thatyou're going to need to hit your uh Hhit your escape velocity for your uh foryour uh IPO or just your or just for uhprofitability or whatever you're uhwhatever uh targets you're you're aimingfor so um in the early in the earlystages of selling there's a lot of a lotof intuition um that's involved it andit can feel kind of random um especiallyif you're in the the enterprise softwarespace you've got a relatively smallnumber of Highly valuable customers andit can feel kind of random why uh somecompanies choose you and some and somedon't but at scale um you know onceyou've got uh 10 to 20 um sales peoplein out in the field you're reallystarting to form a lot more a lot moredata about um about what what's workingand what's not working in your uh inyour marketing and uh and salesprocesses and so it starts to get a muchmore much more quantitative almostengineering uh type of approach um andso this is this is a stage where you uhyou start to think about bringing in anexperienced uh VP of sales or uh or crowho is whose uh role in the business isnot uh not not going out and closingdeals on their own but in in running thebuilding and running the machine that'sgoing to going to bring in those salesum and uh and done right this becomes auh this uh can kind of smooth out a lotof the uh the the lumpiness that can youknow vary quarter to quarter as uh asdeals come and go you should be gettinguh should really focus on your on yourRevenue operations skills at this stageto uh you know have a have a repeatableuh methodology for forcasting umterritory segmentation things like thatum you know you should be able to umable to predict your uh your nextquarter's Revenue um much moreaccurately than you than you were in inearlier stages um and this is this is avery distinct skill set from um anindividual account executive the kind ofpeople that you may have been hiring inin earlier phases but it's really uhreally crucial for uh for scaling upyour uh scaling up your organizationit's also a good practice um things likethe forecasting methodology that's goingto be uh critical in uh as you approachthe the an actual IPO you need to beable to provide public guidance on onfuture future Revenue so you really needa a systems thinker who can uh who canput together the uh put together themachine that's going to going to makethe businessrun um and uh it's it's vital at allstages of your company's journey to uhto put your customers first um themindset you really need to have is thatour success our our success ultimatelycomes from our customers success um andthis is something that can uhthat that uh you know sounds soundssimple and obvious but as as a companyscales it's easy to Take Your Eye Offthe Ball um maybe you're putting in a uhyou know if you originally had yourengineers doing technical support andlater on you put in a dedicated uhcustomer support organization Engineersmay be insulated from the customer to adegree that they don't necessarily seewhat uh what's causing the customer painor um you may uh you may find that youruh uh your incentives have driven um youknow driven some uh some sales in whichuh you know the deal was oversold um andthen uh the customer is is unhappy withwhat they uh what they what they hadpurchased so it's you know it's betterto better to undersell and and overddeliver um to build build that customertrust for the for the long term um sowhatever whatever form it uh it takes uhfor your uh for your business you knowyou've got to ensure that everyone umeveryone up and down throughout theentire organization always keeps the uhthe customers uh customers needs at uhat the at the center of their uh youknow planning and thinking so thatyou're all moving towards uh to towardsuh establishing those those happycustomerrelationships um finally um as you growum you know in some ways the uh the CEOjob is always uh is always the same butin in other ways it's uh it's completelydifferent as the uh as the companycontinues to grow um you know I think uhthere there's a uh a saying that comesfrom SRE uh site reliability engineeringwhich is that you want to automateyourself out of a job every six monthsum in the in the role of a CEO it's kindof the there's kind of a similar patternyou want to hire yourself out of a jobum whatever you're whatever you're doingum you know you want to hire out the uhthe uh team and and the leaders that aregoing to going to take that uh take thatresponsibility for you so your your roleis uh is continue in some ways your roleis continually changing but uh you knowthere are certain certain elements thatare kind of the North that will alwaysbe there um as CEO your your role isalways to uh to Define and and sell thevision um make sure that everyone in thecompany knows uh knows what you're whatyou're building and why um you got tokeep the keep the money in the bank umyou always make sure that you're uh thatyou're spending uh spending your moneyuh money responsible so that you cankeep the keep the lights on and thenyou're you're bringing in that next uhnext wave of uh next wave of of peoplewho are going to be uh going to berunning the uh running the company uhalong with youso that's uh that's kind of our ourlessons learned um in in the eight-yearjourney of of cockroach Labs um just tosummarize um you know i' say the top thetop three things um if you want to takeaway from this uh from this presentationum I thinkuh you know first it would be uh seekseek invest advisors and not notinvestors uh these are going to be veryuh very valuable uh Partners throughoutyour throughout your company's lifeum build your build your culture uhdeliberately um don't just uh don't justlet it be kind of the default thatemerges from throwing uh you knowthrowing six people in a Wei work and uhand seeing what happens um so uh theculture is going to be the uh going tobe the uh the foundation on whicheverything else is built um and it's notit's not something that you just do onceand uh and you're done because you knowall you know all of us have seen overthe last few years culture is Shiftinguh very dramatically with the move to uhto move to remote work and in some casesthe move back so you know always bealways be deliberate about what your uhwhat your how your culture is isevolving um and finally uh stay curiousthis is uh you know it's a long uh along journey and things are always goingto be uh changing and shifting andyou've got to be uh be alert to uh tohow things how things are going and uhand where the uh where the where themarket is uh is taking you so curiositywill we serve you very well in uh inseeing you know oh well that's that'sinteresting you know is this somethingthat I need to to dig into and uh andfix or is this a new opportunity for usum that that sort ofthingso uh we have one one final uh finalremark here from our uh host here withthe uh Google uh the Google startupprogram um as I said we're uh we'recarage Labs is an alumni alumni of thisprogram or at least the version of it uhthat existed eight years ago um so ifyou're if you're eligible it's uh youknow it's free money for uh for yourcloud computing uh costs so uh can be agreat great help when you're when you'restarting out so if you're eligible uh Iwould encourage you to uh take a look atthat"
