these incredible leaders and they areleading key initiatives around how toapply AI responsibly to build what'snext for educationum so thank you for being with us todayand they are pretty well known in theindustry but we wanted to make anintroduction having to to explain alittle bit about the organizationbecause there is a lot of peoplewatching us that most probably are notthat familiar with education so maybewe're going to start with around thisinteractionum first of all I'm Jesus Gomez I workin the public sector team for Googlecloud and in the industry leader fordigital nativesum hi everybody I'm Lev goneik I work atArizona State University I am asu'sChief Information officer and I get achance to work with an incrediblecollection of people I'll get a chanceto talk about the work we're doing in Aiand online education with our colleaguesfrom Ed Plushellothank you thank you for having me hereit's a real pleasure my name is anantAgarwal founder of FedEx professor atMIT and a chief platform officer at x2uedx is a platform company where wepartner with some of the world stockinstitution uh like Google and MITHarvard Oxford Cambridge and otherswhere they offer their courses andcontent on edx and we have over 76million Learners from every singlecountry in the world who are learning ona platform where they learn about prettymuch any topic you want from courses allthe way to complete degreesI'm the CTO of ibel education.com wesimplify access to generative AI forinstructors and content creators toempower themselves to build AI mentorsfor for their students quite containingtheir custom prompts data sets and amongothers we work for NVIDIA for theDepartment of Defense MIT and manyothers and thank you fantastic so as youcan see there are leaders from differenttype of organization top highereducation institution top of linecontent platforming at the companyum we're gonna go through a panel withsome interesting questions that you mayfind really relevant and learn from thembefore that we wanted to spend just acouple of minutes taking a look atstatistics about the global challengesuhthat education organizations are facingtoday okay for those that are not veryfamiliar butumto give you an idea there are more than250 millionChildren and Youth that are out of theschoolright now that they don't have access toschooleven those that have access to schoolhave experiencesignificant learning loss you may haveseen a lot of articles about that butthe average for example the average usesstudent lost half Academic Year becauseof the pandemic so it's not only abouthaving access to school it's about howefficientthe school can be and the third is theneed of upskilling the workers so all ofus are part of that Workforce and youmay have seen this but there is aprediction that 50 of us will need to beretrainedin this decade to prepare tothe rapidly changing job market that weare facingthose are the challenges that we are allfacing in the industryum what we have learned is that these AIInnovation that we are all experiencesare addressing many of these challengesa lot oforganizations and Company and lookinginto how they apply the AI to try toaddress those challengesand there are many fields on that butwhat we are hearing from all of youthree main priorities one is aboutproviding AI powertutoring and Advising to the students wesaw the statistics before so it's abouthow you can provide a private tutor evento those that cannot afford it okaygiving them access to that schoolthe second bucket is about personalizedlearning and how that left will say wehave been hearing about personallearning for 20 years now but this isthe possibility of our not only givingan access to school but given then theright plan of learning okay that istailored to the priorities and there andthe third one is about the possibilityof using AI to automate in thegeneration of content and make thatcontent as relevant and accessible aspossible to themthis is the challenges that we arefacing todayumit's a seller to learn from our guestspeakers and the first question that Ithat they have isfrom all the potential that AI has oneducation and responsibility has forEducation what do you thinkis uh the value that this Innovationabout the AI is going to bring to forexample give Equitable access to highquality of Educationwell I think it's a really big topic andthen you know we stand between you andElla J cool and so we'll try to be asentertaining as we can and I know thesefolks here so no problem there youactually are going to want a standing ofor us so that you don't actually haveto get to the concert uh in 45 minutesto be very serious you knowAI is obviously not newthere is a kind of new kind ofexcitement around generative AI at themoment and it's really worth trying tounderstand you know what opportunitiescome with that there are those who arepredicting that this marks the end ofhigher education for those of us who'vebeen in that industry for a whileuh you know announcements of ourforthcoming death have been probablyover overstated many many times andreally for us at ASU which is one of theof not the largest university PublicUniversity in the country we have a 178000 students uh 80 000 of them areactually studying online 300 degreesoffered by our faculty the mostimportant piece actually is around thiscommitment to inclusion it's afundamental opportunity for us toactually look at this differentlyit's not whether or not universitieswill be around some have said the end ofthe professori at the end of theuniversities as we know it the realquestion is not whether we'll be here inthe next 500 years it's actually whetheror not we're going to be relevant in thenext 500 years and I think that AIactually done properly with again properethical use proper framing of theopportunities to rethink assessment andall of those things really affords us achance to democratize to radicallydemocratize the opportunities and accessto education not only of the data thatyou shared places are real but 41million Americans have started collegeand not finishedthat is an enormous challenge can we useAI to support Pathways back into collegewhether it's through a platform play orwhether through you know many otherkinds of opportunities and theopportunity to do Mass customizationit's certainly very relevant and againhopefully you know through this dialoguetoday we'll be able to give you allkinds of examples of I would saycatalytic work that is being used toaddress the access Mission at ASU thatothers are using across this industry aswell which are not only for universitiesin education but also for trainingopportunities that are out there andusing the AI capabilities that againhave been part of you know Journey forthe last 50 years to really help us takeout the tedium associated with thetraditional industrial model ofEducation which still dominates a hugepart of our industry to create reallygreat opportunities for value-addliberating you know and creating valueopportunities for time to be spent inways that otherwise have been consumedwith a lot of tedium and administriviawe are seeing a huge uh examples of thatfor the last certainly two years at ASUagain hopefully I'll get a chance toshare some of those examples but youknow as opposed to running away from AIor trying to put barriers up around AIat ASU we're all in leaning in againwith the guard rails that everything wedo whether it's our faculty EthicsCommittee that reviews all of our AIproposals and the like you know toreally try to accelerate this in theservice of access to education whetheryou're a traditional student or morelikely going forward a student who'sre-entering the workforce through theworkforce in one way shape or formand you know what as you look at radicalnew technologies coming out they impactvirtually every field known to mankindbut there's only two fields that if youlook at history have have stood immuneto almost all new radical changesone is education and the second isgovernmentthose two never change and if you lookat educationum you know people joke about what werethe biggest innovation in education andsome people point back to the textbookuh in the 1500s at this point to thechalkboard in the 1800s so educationdoesn't change very quickly but I thinkwithdigital learning particularly with theAdvent of massive open online coursesscalable digital learning about a dozenyears ago and and now ai these two havebeen incredible forces for change inonline learning has an impacted CampusLearning not a whole lot maybe in somecampuses you know ASU one of ourpartners has been very innovativebut by and large You Don't See Muchchanging on campusbut both digital learning as well as AIare radically radically radicallychanging the way education is offered soon edx for examplewith the digital education model uh wehave over 76 million Learners learningon edx five million students around theworld have taken a computer sciencecourse and learned coding from DavidMalin at Harvard you know previously hewould teach 300 students at Harvard andnow there's five million around theworld and so the scale can be massive sowith digital learning we impacted scalein a big waywhat AI can do is now allow us topersonalize and take quality to the nextlevelI think briefly alluded to masscustomization so if you look at thefourth Industrial Revolution it's aboutMasspersonalization how do we create scaleyet how do we create personalizedoutcomes so I think digital learningcombined with AI can allow us to getthatmassive scalable access combined withpersonalized outcomes so on edx we'vereleased a number of tools in recenttimespartnering with some amazingTechnologies out of Google and othersthat enable us to offer a lot of theseAI affordances in in within courses orfor faculty authoring so for example welaunched edx expert expert with the bigcapital x looks like big X's are the bigthing out there so this is the big XPerthand so uh you can go into my circuits Iteach an online circuits course from MITon edx and you can go into my circuitscourselog into edx.org it's free go into thecourse and uh the expert will show upand you can ask it any questions and itwill serve as an expert tutor andactually check it out it's a lot of funeven as an instructor I love to go inand ask export all kinds of things tosay can I stump it it's pretty darn goodand so it's actually a lot of fun thateven as a professor to go in and ask andplay around with the AI inside my owncourse and I love to ask it questions tosay how will they explain it onequestion asked okay how would Agarwalteach this topic so yeah you couldactually have some fun with it but youcan see how we are personalizinglearning to each individual where eachindividual can get personalized supportrather than kind of a mass scale programit's also really important for us tolaunch courses and content to teachpeople AIand so we launched a master's degree inAi and machine learning from UT Austinfor ten thousand dollarsand you you won't believe the number ofpeople and number of applicationsthey've received that people are lookingto upskill and reskill very rapidly inthis uh new age you saw that 50 okayprevious slide 50 need upskilling wellit's because of AI and digitaltransformation so we can use onlinelearning to help people upskill veryrapidly so we launched up the master'sdegree in AI we launched a boot campit's a much harder program in Ai andwe've also partnered with the IBL who'shere in creating very very shortprograms intopics like you know introduction to genAi and and Broad General AI topics andthere's just a huge amount of upsurge ininterest so whether you're teaching AIor whether using AI for personalizationum I think I think we just have We'veJust Begun scratching the surface and asa professor I just cannot tell you howexcited I am for the futureso echoing off of what you're sayingabout personalization and inclusion welike to start looking at this problemfrom the point of view of all thesestudents right now who are not beingeducated as as they could be right andwe have for example a partner it's a biguniversity 20 of the students theyaccept come from disadvantagedbackgrounds right these are not studentswho have an excellent understanding ofmath right so they go into theuniversity their understanding of mathis not at that required level so whenthey look at anything technical to majorin their choice is either right I'mgoing to spend a couple of extra yearshere or I'm just going to studysomething else right and that happensfor a lot of people so there are a lotof people who don't have you knowbecause of the circumstances thatthey've grown up in that opportunity todo something as as basic as studyengineering right and for us sort ofthat's the beginning of of theconversation right it's Masspersonalization and inclusion and theway we like to do that is by saying okaywelljust like these students who arestudying math right there are manystudents in other circumstances rightwho are studying their their ownassessment we are Engineers I don'treally know what the best pedagogy is toteach an 8th grader history or somesophomore in college biology so insteadwhat we like to do is say okay theinstructors are going to be able tocreate their mentors right and they'regoing to be able to mess around with theprompts right there are other you knowsolutions that have come out recently soobviously there's the the Khan Academyfamous approach we like to in some wayssay okay well the instructors are goingto have access to the data and to theprompts because they're going to knowbetter right some Engineers somewhereelse who are going to you know push anupdate it's not really going to behelpful for an engineer for a teacherwho knows how to Tinker with the optimalprompts so we like to to do that so it'sequity for an inclusion for the studentswho are otherwise you know kind of introuble right now and also for theinstructors because we think you knowuntil that problem is solved about let'ssay until every student is beingeducated to the you know to the levelthat we want and that they're happy withthen there is you know not much else toto talk about let's say you know jobloss and so on I mean it's just there'sstill a massive amount of work to doit's not done right so can I just jumpin for a second here and you knowdelivery of actual curriculum is one bigboulderthe other piece is actually everythingoutside of the classroom is part ofeducational success and so again a greatopportunity here is to again andstatement not an or statement is to alsothink about all the opportunities to usea AI coaching which is not necessarilyaround content and Content Mastery whichyes absolutely is now more adaptive thanever before but also the idea of thescaffolding that it takes especiallywhen you're talking about the studentgroup or the learner group that isactually generally speaking notsuccessful it's oftentimes fundamentalsbasic things study skills timemanagement skills how to actually findresources in the community to deal withstress and anxiety all the things thatare very real and especially impactstudents who are typically at risk andagain with AI more than every groupbefore we can actually go the we can doMass personalization by actually takinga complete as it were and end-to-endview of the student experience we know alot about the student the more they'rewilling to share with us the more we canprovide not only great curriculuminclude things like career coaching andso on so absolutely why stop it why stopat teaching them calculus or engineeringand so on but go all the way to say okaywhat do you want to be when you grow upright what interests you right whatskills do you have so you can have thiskind of conversation with them to figureout what it is they need to learn how dothey need to learn it and maybe thereare some areas they need to show up andget the right career skills as well so Ithink I think the chance to go end toend like you said I think a hugeopportunity especially for theentrepreneurs you know who are here agreat opportunity again these arethey're building blocks and then there'slet's not forget the scaffolding thatagain that most students today come toschool in order to get a job so let'shelp them get the kind of job that isagain maybe not even in their immediateview maybe just by getting to know thembetter and seeing where they havestrengths have an opportunity tointroduce them to new Pathways in factwe're talking about scaffold buildinghere's an interesting result so you heara lot of people talking about oh we didthis Ai and did that to the AI I thinkI'll throw in a how about some hardnumbers and some dataso we introduced aI assistant in our boot campsso we have intense live human beingshelping learnersbut it turns out to contact the livehuman being you may take some time solive human beings are still there but weintroduced an AIassistant and tutor that can providereal-time like instantaneous support tolearners we made that available to bootcamp learnerswe found that okay let me let me ask theaudiencethe number of students that preferredtalking initially talking to the AIassistant expert versus a liveinstructor what ratio do you think itwasthe the percentage of people that preferto talk to the AI assistant versus thelive assistant as their first stepsomebody want to guess what percentage50 50.okay over 50.80 prefer talking to AIthis is uh this is data99 so we looked at the number ofinteractions99 where to AI one to a human now ofcourse the human's very importantbecause they you could we can escalatethings to a human so they could answerand then we ask the student why is itthat you were more comfortable talkingto AI than to uh the humans you know I'mshy talking to a human no this is AIit's impersonal so it's just so mucheasier to say random things and not lookstupid in front of a computer yeah yeahI can totally relate to that when I cameto U.S uh 13 years ago my English waseven worse than now and I this type oftool actually helped you to buildself-confidence you know so you have thepossibility of reaching out to anintelligent tutor first and build aself-confidence that's much better andwe we actually have been told many timesthat professors are seeing a lot ofvalue on giving for example a student apossibilityof having a private tutorial beforecoming into the class so they reduce thevariability of knowledge coming into theclassum can I just offer another data point Imean I love that we're maybe talkingabout building on data here so everystudent in this country has to submit afinancial aid form it is one of thefirst barriers to success that firstimpression that the students and theirfamilies have of University in the last14 days ASU had 83 000 separate studentsapproach our experience Center the callcenter and like anat was talking aboutwith respect to the way you used the botwe also have over the last couple ofyears created essentially an AI drivenmachine learning based on naturallanguage processing interactions throughchats and other things to actually andthere again not numbers like 99 to 1 butagain when you're scaling with that kindof a peak you can't put enough people onthe phones to deal with that number oversuch a short period of time and so 42percent of all students chose toactually interact with sunny sunny beingfrom Arizona is our bot andresolved 42 and resolved their issuewithout having then again escalate tohuman in the middle which again is justa concrete way of getting to scale whichis again I think the overall challengeas well as being able to customize itthat's perfect so as you can see theirenergy and their passion really excitedabout this it is a strange when atechnology come up it is exchange thatall the playersactually agree on the potential of thetechnology you know it's many times it'slike somebody's gonna push back or it'sgoing to be concerned soum this is one of this time when yousee that this type of Technologyactually the peopleknow that this is happening right andand the benefits outweighs the potentialthe potential risk so one question thatI have is this is changing traditionalinstitutionspeople said this is happening how we getthis right so a question I have for youis how do you Embrace and shape thistechnology and how do you as you leadyour teams make sure that thistechnology is being embraced uhresponsibly at your Institutionsowe let's see what we're trying to do isin general not push a top-down solutionfor everybodyright what we like to do is say okay sofor whether we're talking aboutinstructors or there could be even youknow Engineers right or whoever isbuilding on our applications is you haveaccess to this data right here is howthe grounding is done right and weobviously have layers of abstractiondepending on how complex somebody wantsto get right but you have access to thatyou have access to all the systemprompts you have access to all the guardrailsright so when you come up with anapproachto guard rail your application and theapproach that you think is best then youcan implement it without us right so weare effectively building blocks we haveof course you know the defaultguardrails and default configurationslike only answer if you find thequestion in the text and so on but thisis you know it's pretty pretty powerfuland we since we have on one hand youknow universities and other companiesgovernments Etcthere are different people's differentvalues different approaches you knowwhat we like to do is you know here areall the tools so it's not massivelyoverwhelming but you encode your valuesand your approach into thisI thinkI think the way to approach is that anyany new technology uh is going to havefar-reaching impacts whether positive ornegativeuh you know I I love to quoteShakespeare here where where Shakespearesaid you know there's nothing good orbadit's only think that make it itself youknow like a knife right you know you cando good but you can do harm so samething with AIit's a how many of you have seenOppenheimeryeah it's the same you know they allstruggled with the same challenge herewas a incredibly powerful you knowphysics based Quantum technology thatthey could do all kinds of things withit and so AI is just like that and myanswer to the question is actually verysimple which isas long as the forces for good very veryrapidly make progress and do good stuffwith itwe will hopefully overwhelm the badstuff and so the key is not to try toprevent the bad stuff by legislation butto move very quickly and create apis andcreate tools like you IBL is doingcreate them release them put them in theopen source domain so that more and morepeople can get access to these tools sothat the good overwhelms the bad uses oftechnology and so rather than using AIto cheat let's create graders with AIlet's create all kinds of technologiesthat will help students so by you knowjust overwhelm the system with goodstuffand I think that is the way to thinkabout it and even by building all ofthese things we can create variousethical boundaries and guardrails andI'm sure you'll talk about that so youknow let me pause there but really let'slet's use AI for good very rapidly atleast the tools as open source get themout there get people using itjust to quote another English author youknow it was the best of times it was theworst of times I mean and I think thatthat is kind of the the you know thereality every time a new technologyactually gets introduced into the mix ifI can I just want to sort of connect thequestion to the morning keynote whichfor those of you who are unable toattend and those of you online whoaren't able to was actually about LegacyLegacy organizations and the challengeof actually introducing AI into actuallya technical Legacy organization and youknow I run a fairly low they're over 2000 it professionals at ASU supportingthis huge Enterprise including theonline world that we've chatted a littlebit about and one of the biggestchallenges and again I know enough aboutyour story to know that institutionallyand personally you've had to Grapplewith this as well how do you actuallybegin to engage with not only to talkabout the upside opportunity with airbut to actually have people who arewhose identity is associated with apre-aisort of experience and when they look inthe mirror they don't see themselves asactually being part of this radicalcatalytic transformation opportunity andso at ASU much is again I've learned asmuch from uh from Anon and the MIT workwe're actually creating as we did withASU online an organization that sitsoutsideof the of the core Legacy organizationbecause it is not motivated to embraceit sees at a minimum as a threat andpeople can be either you knowproactively or passively aggressive tothe whole idea and so we've created afusion team it's a very modest team butit's one of the few early models inhigher education to actually move alegacy organization one that's not borndigital uh as as you all have donethrough I think a fairly similar journeyand seeing whether or not that willactually Propel uh folks who again we'renot going to free we're not going todiscount or eliminate all of theappropriate concerns around ethics andbias when we stand up these teams butthese are teams who are who are beingcharged with taking a mountain withoutworrying that there is nothing but uhyou know thorns and and fire everywherethey go snakes biting at them becausethey've been given privilege as a fusionteam to actually stand up this work it'sgot all of our best uh Talent associatedwith us from across ASU not just insideEnterprise technologyso a lot of change managementin the questions yeah suremany many of our people in the audiencemay be wondering what is your experienceworking with Google and during withGoogle a lot of people ask us about yeahwe want to do this but how we getstarted right so um one question I haveis if you can explain to the audienceyour experience what type of initiativeyou are partnering with Googlewell I meanwe find and it's not to be a suck upright but we've what Google is doing isgenerally two to three months ahead ofwhat the mainstream is talking aboutright so you see with the keynoteyesterday right so you have now llamatwo right so these are for the peoplewho want to completely fine-tune theirown their models with the convenience ofnot having to deploy their own clustersand so on right so you still do thatright with the data governancerequisites and then the other endyou also have bison right and all ofthese sort of pay as you go tiny modelsfor people who want to you know spendmore more cautiously right so Googleseems to be you know I said and insteadof instead of or Google isfor us on the big model right where youhave complete control also on the littlemodelthe vector databases for example PGVector right it seems to be a standardOkay Google already comes out with whatwas that alloy that is already insanelyfaster than the than the default so youlook at that and then you look at thelarger ecosystem of Education righteverybody you know with their that inGoogle classroom and so on and well it'spretty helpful right to be able to sayokay well you don't have to now beshipping out all of your data becausethis is really useful if you have accessto the data it's not really that greatfor all the data for example from GoogleClassroom to have to be migratedsomewhere else so then you can you knowdo some language model application ontopwith Google you say okay I have all ofmy Google Classroom data here I have myyou know other student analytics hereand I'm going to have in the sameecosystem these models whether I wantthem big or small more control lesscontrol more pricing or less pricingit's still you know within the within usso good job we've certainly been a verypleasantly surprisedwe did a lot of evaluation I'll give youone exampleof a big collaboration we have withGoogleum and just so you'll know that edxthere's nothing small uh you know I liketo joke that unless something has sixzeros in it it's not interesting to meso we have 4 000 courses on our platform76 million Learners learning and so oneof the aspects of personalization isthat uh you know how do we how do wepersonalize uh language uh you know Iwas in Andhra Pradesh two weeks ago inIndia it's Telugu there and so you knowhow do you how do you createtranslations and it used to be prettyexpensive before where there's a lot ofthere's some machine translation butthere's a fair amount of hand correctionand tuning that was required previouslybut now one of the projects we'veembarked with Google on is thistranslation into a large number oflanguages and we've releaseda number of our courses translated intoa dozen languages and our work right nowwhat we found to be very pleasant isthat the work we're doing is actuallynot in tuning the translationsit's really in building the plumbingyeah where the translations happen soquickly and they are pretty darn goodthatthe work that we've done to kind ofoptimize the translation is no longerneeded but the plumbing we're buildingis how do we rapidly send our coursesand content and get the translations andpopulate them I mean that's the part youknow focus on I call it kind of theplumbingand so uh that's been very successfuland you're focused on if someone makes achange to a course you know how do weincrementally get uh new translations wewere looking to do any incrementaltranslations but then we found that it'sfast enoughand the cost is pretty decent that whitewater with incrementalism just do itagain and so uh you know sometimes thegood technology a sledgehammer isactually a pretty darn good tool so sowe've really enjoyed some of these uheffortences in quality and scale thatthat the Google team has been able togive us yeah I'll simply add and maybejust build on that example that thereare probably 20 projects that we'reworking on with Google and just to beclear ASU is working with all the theother suspects as well but in particularin the Google space you know we have aninitiative which are all welcome to takea look at which is called the 100million learner initiative it's aneffort essentially to provide to peoplearound the world access to a collectionof course materials focused onentrepreneurshipand one of the key requirements isactually the ability to do translationinto into starting with 40 languages andagain figuring out that pipelineactivity we've worked with with Googlefrom day one to build what we call thelanguage Factory which is now part ofGoogle's overall pipeline support fortranslation and great againpresentations here about yourpartnership with Nvidia to actuallyaccelerate that work even further but inaddition to that you know James Monicawho who owns AI you know 4 or Google hasjust been a fabulous resource for allthe ways is that we're almost inaddition to but with everyone focusedand maybe perseverating on generative AIall the other AI kinds of projects thatare underway uh in the environmentwhether those are visual sound videowe've actually created there's anannouncement that was made a couplemonths ago on a project to essentiallyprovide a generative AI curriculum in aChromebookdeliveredday one all the curriculumpop it open and no matter where thatchild is not only do they have thecurriculum but they have also got theintelligent tutor uh on board a long wayand again that came from you know Jamesstarted going right we'd love to workwith the university that's interested inthe mission just to tie it back to yourfirst point about inclusion so thatthere's a 200 or 250 dollar solutionwhen you can load up all that curriculumand make it available and you know thoseare the kinds of innovation activitiesthat we expect from from Google becauseof the breadth of of the interest hereand you know obviously opportunities tonow look to how do we take all of theexciting work that's going on uh insideAi and begin to look for Google to stepinto a Solutions orientation you knowhere's the problem set you don't have toworry about all the complexity ofdealing with the various business unitsinside Google but if you want to beincorporating we will actually resolvethat for you and bring it to youhopefully at a friendly higher educationpricing model that worksno one of the thing that why we lovepartnering with you all as well is whenwe show you the technology and we saylike hey let me show you something abouttechnology we were working on you comeup with this uh very crazy but valuableideas about oh I could use that for thisand we are like oh wow we never thoughtabout it that this is really solid um asan industry leadersum Visionaries what that get you excitedin the next year what do you thinkif we meet here in this room next yearyou will love to talk about itsolet's see all right so different fewdifferent things right so oneobviously a student who is otherwiseyou know tougher toeducate gets educated right but from onevery direct example because we talk morewith instructors right and we talk morewith with the engineers at theseorganizations and then with the studentsthemselves is somebody go from I'mscared about this gonna steal my job Idon't want to do it two oh it's actuallyreally nice so for example we have aprofessor mutual friend Lorena from theGeorge Washington University right whosaysokay I one of the useful things aboutthis is if this tells me what thequestions that students haveare right because they still see the youknow the history and so on so now I knowbetter what my students are thinkingtherefore in my instruction the next dayI can do things I can say things that Iwould not have otherwise said right sothat's a very nice reversal so whatwe're seeing is that anybody whois able to sort of you know take a lookand say okay what is my what did I evenget into education for right personallyused to help people and educate peopleand now I can do something that Icouldn't do before right an engineer forexample that says okay I can build anapplication that's now an order ofmagnitude cooler right because I can youknow build on these apis and these sdksso to now do something that I couldn'tdo before so that from an engineeringstandpoint and you know trying to buildis is pretty cool for me I'll give avery boring answer actually as to whatwe'll see next year it's very clear thatthe whole field is moving exponentiallyyou mentioned that the Google staysahead by two months and just so you knowyou know two months that seems littlebut no this this is an exponential feeland so you know every second is like uhin in previous terminology years butthe very simple boring thing that I willsay is dataso right now this year is about lettinga thousand flowers bloomyou know we've launched maybe a half adozen tools within edx uh working withGoogle and several other innovators inthe field uh in Ai and we've launchedtranslations that we talked about we'velaunchedtools that help professors createsummarizations of their contentaccording to a 10th grader or a thirdgrader we can do that and we've launcheditvarious forms of assistance and tutorshelping insidecoursestools that help Learners find the rightcontent and find the right Pathways soit's it's it's really a led a thousandflowers bloom and try out lots of newthingsat the same time you're now graduallymoving intoa domain of data trying to learn allright having the school assistant isfine butwhat's the point you know did it reallyhelp the learner learn better what werethe outcomesso we're now gearing up to do a lot of ab tests so one of the big Innovations inthe edx platform and it's pretty muchthe only major learning platform thathas a b testing built into it so anyProfessor can run an A B test like thiswell you guys know this where I cancreate an A B C D path and giveeverybody a common test at the endand so a lot of these tests are beingplanned and will be run and so by nextyear there'll be a lot of data that willcome out that says look all of thisstuff is useless it actually hurtsstudents right so then we'll have toreally think about whoa that's not goodon the other hand it may say that it'sactually help students it's engage themmore or uh by addressing their questionsand doubts and teaching methodologieschanges in teaching methodologiesthey've learned better so we will get alot more data and my hope is that wewill have a lot more concrete evidencein terms of what is working and what isnot what are the kinds of things weshould be doing what are the kind ofthings we should not be doing so to methat's the you know that's a big oneso I'll just sort of you know in bulletform say this Fusion team that I referto has a flagship 250 initiatives thatwe're working on 30 of them are actuallywith Ed plus our online program for ASUonline uh I think that sort of two majordifferences a year from now which willshow whether or not we're maturing uh inthe way and I'll pick up on the firstone on data here is whether or not wecan actually show especially for onlineLearners what because that is where theopportunity is in my my view in terms ofaccess and sort of all the criticalvariables of that slide that you show ispersistence can we use AI to show thatstudents will persist to complete theirclass finish their course of study gettheir certificate their credential ortheir degree that will be one of the keyindicators and the other piece is ifwe're really good and this is more thanjust as it were kind of a fad we willactually be able to have an intellectualframeworkthat actually starts with a commitmentto a new kind of literacyand we have again lots of debates ineducation about forms of literacy andalthough I hate the term promptengineering it is a form of literacy interms ofexplorationand essentially the critical tool setsyou need to explore a very differentvast knowledge base not using a Literacyfor being able to searchbut actually a literacy that is based onyour ability to prompt and that piece ofit is today really just for thecognizende and so we have one of thecore courses that we're actuallybuilding now is again again hate theterm but it's prompt engineering foreveryoneand that is a fundamental piece of it ifwe do it right then we hope this will beacross the curriculum Beyond highereducation because that literacy isactually a central theme and we'll see ayear from now we're making progressdidn't you guys put the course on promptengineering on edx yeah I'm totally withyou you know some of these uh newcompetencies right uh you know newphrases that we never heard before rightlike prompt engineering or like you knowgenerative learning about generative Aiand you know what is what is unfortunateis that you know that number the 50 ofthe world will need upskilling 50workers need to be retrained in thisdecade to solve the skills Gap franklynew technologies are coming out so fastyou know how many of you have heard thephrase prompt engineering six months agookay fine this is a Google crowd yeahbut today everybody's talking aboutprompting hearing it's a new thing it'sa whole new field there are courses inprompt engineering right and sothat is one of those examples of thingswhere people have to be retrained so thenew technologies come out that number isactually increasing and so it's actuallynot decreasing amazing well we are ontimethe other day I was reading and I sawlike Thomas said this song invited thethe light bulb more than 150 years agoand still more than one billion peopledo not have access to powerso we really want to thank you for whatyou do with for your communities andmaking sure that people have access tothis opportunity for all of them andthank you for all of you for attendingand I encourage you to watch out forwhatthese guys and their organizations areare doing in the in the next years tocome because they are going to help us alot enjoy the concert[Applause]foreign"
