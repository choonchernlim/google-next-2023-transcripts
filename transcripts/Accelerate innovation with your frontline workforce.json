a small part ofGoogle cloud and I've got Philippe andSam with me uh why don't you two um tellme as tell us a little bit and youraudience about who you are and what yourcompany does yeah so maybe with fewwords on veoria varia is uh aims to bethe Benchmark company for ecologicaltransformation we're about to twentythousand uh people all around the worldin more than 55 countries or activitiesare around uhdesigning implementing and operating uhpractical and useful solutions for watertreatment Waste Management energymanagement and through data activitieswe contribute to uh ease access toresources freezer resources and evenreplenish resources through circularprocess and so I'm Philippe Benoit I'mworking at group CTO officeat the end of cyber security and uh andcompliance and I'm also a global digitalworkplace program directorto hear um you tell us more Sam hieveryone Sam Sibley so I work at theproject management Institute and a lotof you will know us either as PMI or forthe PMP qualificationum I've kind of fallen into this spacemy background is X tennis player fallinginto the world of innovation Techum so I don't know how I fell into itbut uh so that's my Global organizationum serving the project managementprofession and we have millions in ourcommunity that we serve so technology isa critical component of the projecteconomy and that's why we're here todayto talk about it let's give youapologizeumgreat well we got to talk a lot aboutFrontline workers today we'll do alittle bit of introduction there andthen the main topic of course is how toaccelerate Innovation for front-endworkers andum I think we hear some great examplesabout how technology can be used toreally Empower a lot of the Frontlineworkers a group that historically oftenhas not been very digitally empoweredand transformedum just on the logistics side we'llleave about 15 minutes at the end for Qday you'll see there's a microphone soum if you have questions at the endplease come and ask and I also shouldpoint out the session is being recordedso you can share it with your colleaguesafterwardswith that said let's diveum a little bit into Frontline workers Imean I think everybody knows Frontlineworkers of courseum uh what they are but I think it'sworth diving a little bit into whatactually makes their lives hard and whatis the impact on the businesssooddly enough frontal workers or oddlybut Frontline workers are typically theface of a company right it's whetherit's a store employee whether it's asomebody uh you know in a garage offixing cars whether it is an amusementpark it's the Frontline workers whotypically are the face of a company andwe all know that these days theexperience that your customers have withyour company is largely defined by thatengagement with front-end workers and soas crucial as they are we find that theytypically are a group that have veryhigh turnover we find that there is theyare not always as engaged as we wouldlike so there's high disengagement andoften the digital transformation reallyhas bypassed them and so I think theseare some of the challenges that umprobably all of you are seeing in yourcompanies and in today's session wereally will hear some of the approachesand ways of how we can change that andthe impact that that bringsso with that saidum why don't we talk a little bit aboutthe specifics in your company in ViolaPhilippe why don't you tell us a bitmore about what kind of Frontline workerroles do you have yes so Voda is autility so it means that most of ourmost of my colleagues are on the fieldmore than three-fourths ofof various employees are field workersumso it meanscould you go to the next slide of coursewe are all resources as you can seebut we there are diversity of activitiesbecause of of this uh of all the thethings that you are doing it can beoperation on a water treatment plants itcan be uhuh biowaste treatment installationoperation also it can be maintenance ofwater networks between driving trucks uhfor Waste correction and so this andmany many other activities and thisdiversity of activities make a countlessopportunities to digital uh digitallysupport or Workforce in their dailytasks so our ambition is clearly toprovide the right digital toolbox to ouremployeesand to to enable for them moreefficiency more productivity uh helpthem to be more cyber resilience ofcourse that's also a big stage for usand to focus on added value tasks forfor the businessum so we we can switch to a quickexample in the next slide uh so what aresome of the do you want to talk aboutthe child so there's certain challengesthat you face with digitaltransformation or what are the kind ofyeah yeah so our uh to illustrate thatwe we can uh speak about brand new brunuis one of our plants it's a white uhWaste Management plants uh in France andsoum in this uh on this plant I adopteddigital tools so they unsure the digitaltransformation of their activities andso thanks to that I answer manychallenges they faced uh and among themit's a reduction of paper-basedprocesses and also uh the theImprovement of the collaboration withinthe site and also with other sites sosharing expertise experience with allthe sitesumnow Sam clearly PMI I think is lessabout having Frontline workers but ofcourse you work with a lot of companiesthat have Frontline workers so tell us abit more about what do you see kind ofmore broadly and that bigger pictureso I'll link it back to the to theproject manager umI think we all see projects are beingdisrupted everywhere right and projectmanagers play a critical role in thatand if you think about technologytechnology is the biggest Catalyst tochange in the way in which we manage andwork right everyone knows that soculturally it's very very different sowhat we see is that empowering projectmanagers to understand two things numberone how do you really understand as apractitioner how to leverage technologyto be more efficient in what you do howdo you free up time how do you drivebetter outcomes deliver on time Etc butthe other thing is how do you become astrategist how do you really think aboutunderstanding the opportunity morelonger term as to how your project orprogram or portfolio is going to be ableto leverage technology and I thinkthat's something that we're playing orwe believe at PMI being the standardbehind project management it's somethingthat we feel very passionate about andwe should be at the front of educatingthe community around that so the lens isvery different it's not necessarilyFrontline Workforce but I would say thatproject managers are at the front ofproject and organizational change andtherefore have a critical role to playin that area okay great nowuh both of you as we just heard you knoware facing complex problems and thefront-end workers do cover very widerange of responsibility right especiallyin your case as you describe threequarters of the company are Frontlineworkers it's the core of your businessum and you're both trying to solve fortechnology needs that can serve both thevariety of needs in front-end Workforceas well as the broader organization ofcourse who are not front-line workers soSam on the the PMI you've spent I thinkquite a lot of time studying howorganization can successfully Empowertheir Workforce with this concept thatwe call citizen development which is youknow being able to build applicationseven though you're not an app developerand that's you know what we often findsomething very relevant to Frontlineworkers because a lot of these tasks aremaybe not even fully understood in thelevel of detail by somebody who isn'tactually engaged in it and so having thepeople who are doing the task solvingthe problem often they're going Partnersso can you share a bit about whatcitizen development is about for you andhow you and PMI see have seen it createimpact sure yeah so first of all I meancitizen development or CD isit's been around for a while like it's amovement it's a movement that's gainingmore traction over time and it's reallycome about because of the left the powerof no Code and low code technologyum but you know you you mentionedearlier it's a movement that empowersnon-technical people to be able to buildbuild applications right which is greatum now there's obviously things thathave to be considered when you when youopen the treasure chest up to a widerange of peopleum but really the reason why this cameabout was a couple of things number onewe all know there's a huge supply anddemand issue I'm not going to talk aboutthat because every conference you go toeveryone talks about supply and demandall that kind of stuff but if youactually think about it logically thedemand for technology and Innovationright now has never been higher there isa significant deficit of traditionaldevelopment capabilities across anorganization in fact there's one statthat we did a lot of research aroundthis and that over 67 of organizationswho are trying to find specific I.Ttalent to server to to place them to aparticular role can't find it that's amajor problem right I mean we can evenjust look at it and say whatever butwe've got to act and do something aboutit um and if you think about it you knowand Philip you mentioned it but theFrontline workers are closer to theproblem or the opportunityso why not Empower culturally thosepeople to be able to solve problems andAchieve great Innovation at the frontline Innovation on the edge it's allabout the Frontline Workforce right soum I think that's really important butfrom a benefits point of viewumyou you really need to think about thisas culturally it opens up a massiveopportunity to drive better Innovationmore empowerment right if you Empoweryour Frontline Workforce to be able todo moreum retention is much better right peopleare more empowered and more motivatedand committed to where they work becausethey can actually do something ratherthan relying on going to you know anexternal group to ask for some helprightumand the whole Speed and Agility is keyright I think we have a diagram of youknow especially how do you then take itout in an organization yeah so before Igo into that right so um but keep it upthat's fine sowe worked with a very large organizationand they they quoted something and saidjust because you get the keys to a cardoesn't mean you're going to drive thatcar safely from A to B without crashingyou think about for a minute right sothis is to think about this whole worldof Citizen development you get accessyou get the keys to the carbut but what are the guard rails inplace right I mean that really reallyneeds to be thought through so what PMIcreated was this concept of Citizendevelopment canvas which is allunderpinned by a maturity model and whatyou can see on there isat the bottom the circle illustrateswhat's really really easy right so thisfirst phase of Discovery andexperimentation is happening everywhereI can guarantee every organization inthis crowd in some pockets are doingsome level of innovation when it comesto no code and Loco technologythe reality is moving outside of thatcircle is actually quite complex andit's complex because it's a major it's achange program accountability riskownership kpis operating model these areall things that that you have to thinkabout especially in a complexorganization so what we've tried to doat PMI is to really anchor that aroundsome sort of Playbook or blueprint whichis what you can see on here as a canvasthat allows organizations to moveoutside of that Circle which is wheremost of the world are really kind ofoperating and what I would say to folksin the I.T space if there's any I.Tfolks in this audience which I imaginethere are going to be is that we seethis as being all about Fusion you canyou can empower the Frontline Workforcebecause you don't want a stifleInnovation but at the same time you needto put guardrails in place to protectand it's this Fusion Dynamic of thosetwo worlds coming together thatintersect which is where we see largeorganizations finding tremendous valueright so I think this really underpins alot of the a lot of the governance andoperating model and risk managementaround adopting no Code and low code andI can give some examples later on okaygreat thank you Samum now I think for for violia you alsohave a very specific approach uh yeahmaybe share some yeah to answer yourquestion uh we have to to have in mindthat such digital empowerment cannot beachieved without any uh efforts or uhit's a long journey and so for that I'dlike to to just talk aboutum via Cloud strategyum so we we started in 2013 with uh wewe have entered in a public Cloud a susfirststrategy and in 2017 we launched a mainFoundation project to support ourposition of digital business partner anddigital solution provider so the firstproject is a better crowd which is uhall about moving our assets to thepuberty crowd crossing our on-premisedata center and uh and supporting thetransformation from of our applicationto a cloud native format and there is asatawad which is a visible part of theiceberg for uh and the end users foremployees which is about providing acommon uh more modern more collaborativemore secure digital workplaceenvironment to to everybody and and soum the the ambition of satawad isincluded in in the name of the theprogram because satawat stands forsecure at any time from anywhere andfrom any device and so that's exactlywhat we want for our end usersto have the same experience that we allhave in our personal life when youaccess your bank account you don't carewhere you are which device you use whattime it is you just want to accesssecurity to your bank account forinformation through an internetconnection and that's the targets of uhof satawad so satawat provide moresecure more collaborative environmentand it enables also for employees to usethe device that best fits their needsbecause uh it provides a device agnosticenvironmentor or is is on on the web so the webbrowser is the access deviceum so that that's uh thethe the program which allows the theuser to uh to be a more uh productiveum to answer your question abouttechnology what's important for me is touh to uh keep watching new technologiesuh following a new feature on existingplatforms uh checking the evolution ofnew platform new technologies such aslocal nucad generative AI I have tomention this during this Google nextbecause that's the main topic but that'san important thing uh to to go ahead onthe digital transformation thank youactually I guess it's a good time toplug app sheet which is you knowGoogle's offering for low code no codeit's part of the workspace offering andactually talk about gen AI I hope someof you had a chance to to see oursession earlier I think we had in thedeveloper keynote and others we showed abunch of how we can use AI to makebuilding apps easier as well and so it'salways fascinating I find how the sametechnology that creates better outcomekind of for the the product also becomespart of the tools of how actually thisempowerment advances because we all knowthat funny enough it's it's really hardto make things easy and so making appbuilding easy actually start uses moreand more of that very Advanced verylatest technology that we havea little bit but the whole likeconvergence of the the CD world no codeand Loco with AI I meanit's all about democratization makingthings more accessible I mean thenarrative's the same I mean when no Codeand low code first came about and it wasabout empowering more people to be ableto do more right widening the funnelJenny is the same concept right it'sjust empowering more people um to beable to achieve stuff rather than asmall selection of people it just addsmore and far more advanced ways in someways right and now like um with appsheet you can literally like talk aboutwhat kind of app you would want and itwill start build that app for you andit's all just pushing to and as you saylike widening the audience who cancreate the outcome they want becauseoften if we truly have Frontline workersor people who run and process build appsthey know the outcome they know whatthey want but they just traditionallydon't have the means of getting thereand that is what always gets me excitedabout the space I think technologyshould be there right to serve people tomake lives easier to help and not be anobstacle that's complex and difficultnowwe talked a lot about you knowtechnology and we talked about some ofthe problems specifically you know thatyou're trying to solve like let's talkabout the solution and some of theFrameworks and best practices uh thatare involved there and so um youmentioned that a lot earlierum so why don't you tell us a little bitmore about how you implement that andwhat that means yeah so Saturday's queryor digital workplace framework uh it hasof course an I.T Dimension uh because itrealizes three main principles first oneis the adoption of Google workspace butthere is a transformation of theinformation system to a web and Cloudformat and last but not least the threeor third principle is the adoption ofChromebooks one when it's done becausewe consider it the most efficient mostsecure device to access such informationsystem and so it has a 90 Dimensionbecause itit's about deploying tools it's aboutmanaging operations it's aboutincreasing the Cyber resilience but uhis also an Enterprise project becauseit's about cultural change new way ofworking more transparency moreefficiency more collaboration so peopleare able to know to focus onbusiness-centric activities and to todevelop new way of working all togetherso that's for satawad and one of thechallenge uh we have with satawad is tokeep enriching the satawada toolboxdigital toolbox and so the the lastcomponents that we enter and that's herewe I make the link with uh with uh whatyou you mentioned about appsheet thelast tool that we are integrated in theour satellite toolbox is a app sheetwith two clear ambition one to boostsatellite progress because we still havea remediation to do many applicationsare not yetsatellite compliance so we keepremediating this application that's thefirst ambition but the other ambition isclearly to cover not yet digitizedprocesses and boost digitaltransformation of the organization andenable or end user to uh to be creativeand to automate AIDS optimize theirdaily processes so thatour Ambitions our first stress challengehave been during the preparation phaseto define the right governance for sucha platformit takes it took time but no we we weDefine the right governance yeah mygirlfriend's definitely a key aspect umSam kind of Sam quiet same question toyou so uh you know how have you managedto help standardize some of theseprocesses to help roll out thetechnologyso I'd probably summarize it inthere's three assessmentsand what I mean by assessment is aprocess that an organization needs tofollow that we're seeing as beingcritical in this process one isa suitability assessmentthere's so many times that people try toadopt technology and it's the wrong usecase it's just the wrong pathway forthem you know but something so basic isgoing through a suitability assessmentjust people don't do they just gostraight to jumping into buildingsomething right and so I think whatwe're seeing in major organizations isthat need for suitability provides thatgovernance and that that standard thateveryone can follow along a pathwayum which is critical the other one beingrisk assessments right so you know and Italk with a lot of organizations I canyou know name one because in the publicyou look at Shell so shell have builttheir whole citizen development businessand by the way you're talking aboutthousands and thousands of Citizendevelopers around the world they'repretty Advanced when it comes back tothe canvas that I mentionedum but they've built everything based onthe Zona model and that zonal modelbasically dictates who in theorganization is able to build what basedon risk it's very simple right so it'sgot It's got suitability assessmentsit's got risk assessments it defines thelevel of complexityum the level of risk for theorganization Based on data and variousother mechanisms and then it provides apathway to that individual right and itnavigates that individual through a pathso that that is a really reallyimportant one but the last one arguablyis the most important and companies likeshell and major organizations around theworld are really leveraging is anenvironmental check what exists in yourorganization today that you can leveragehow many times do we see technologybuilt upon technology and all thisLegacy platforms that just becomes youput a plaster or for folks here like aBand-Aid on top of a deep wound where itdoesn't solve the problem you justlayers of the onion just go up and youcan't unravel it it's a problem sounderstanding your environment and whatfits and what doesn't fit and what canyou Leverage is a really really criticalcomponent so we're seeing those threeassessments Frank as being reallycritical to the governance and theprocess and I assume you talked aboutthe you know the criticality securityand so on I assume typically you wouldhave businesses started you knowsomewhat maybe less less critical partsto kind of start to get their feet wetwith this new technology or or to useJump Right In and kind of take somethingthat has a really high payoff it's acompanies are doing it very differentlyumwhat I can say is thatlarge organizations that are reallyadopting this aretrying to solve the diff the mostchallenging problem they're trying tosolve right now is a graduation processthat takes a low risk app that was builtby a Frontline workerand mobilizing it across the Enterpriseso moving it more into their itinfrastructure right and that thatgraduation process because it sees somuch value in what's being created onthe front line how do you then bringthat into the overall organizationalinfrastructure so that graduationprocess is hard because there's lots ofpolitics culturally is reallychallenging you've got two groups offolks that don't necessarily worktogether very much who owns what who'saccountable and who owns the risk thatneeds to be managed it's reallydifficult so that's going back to thecanvas that I mentioned that's the rolethat we're trying to play in the marketno it's it's fascinating you know for usum building the software we dodefinitely see very different approachesand we see some companies that indeedfocus on the the democratization andreally roll it out extremely Broad andyou know we have one company with likecall center employees basically they gettime for workshops and they've came upwith solutions to others where it'smaybe more traditional through kind ofI.T where you where you start to youknow develop solutions that then getrolled out more broadly so definitely alot of different approaches are possibleand and you know whatever fits for yourcompany I think is always a weighing ofthose different factors nowum why do you think it's important fororganizations to have that governancestrategy you know we just heard some ofthe aspect of security uh Philippe whatuh what do you see at violia yeah so inour case it was uh not we cannot uh do afull assessment of everybody and so on220 uh uh people thousand people aroundthe world it would have been a nightmareso we we focused uh on defining a rightgovernance uh to avoid past mistakesand so a vote to to recreate Shadow I.Tand that was one of our main stake thethefor this governanceum so the challenge I've been to findthe best compromise between a digitaltransformation and uh and creativityversus having the right level of controlto to avoid this Shadow I.T and so todaythe result is that any employee withinWarrior can access the the app sheetplatform but must comply to two levelsof control the first level of control isthey have to become a citizen developerwhat does it mean it means that theyhave to follow a training course to havethe right skill on the platform so uh toto know what they are doing and theythey have to be aware of verlia a localapplication platform Gordon rules sothat's a set of rules that we havedefined for such platformonce there are citizen developer theycan access the platform and designprototype application that means thatthere is a restricted number of userstoday it's about three users so it'sreally limited and to go a step furtherto extend the number of users they haveto publish the application theapplication and for that that's a secondlevel of control there is a checklistand this checklists have a set of actionthat they have to achieve the mainactions are recording the application ina global portfolio so everybody knowswhat applications have been developedwith uh with the app sheetit means that some cities in Europe canInspire from otheruse casesand not to reinvent the wheel when ithas already been downa second action is to build a communitybetween the city the citizen developerand the user of the application toestablish a Communication channel forimprovement for issue management so it'sa kind of Maintenance that's the way wewe find to to have a maintenance forsuch application and another main actionis the compliance to what we call saveson metrics that's an internal tool thatwe design it's a really simple tool it'saself-assessment tool based on 10question a mix of functional andTechnical question if every answer arein the green zone they can use a localapplication platform if it's orangemaybe ask your it teams and if it's redpass you away and go to more traditionaldevelopment because your use case is toocomplex so that that's the two level ofcontrols that we we Define okay I loveit that's a very sophisticated model andstill very broad I'm really impressedand our objective is to to to live oruser Express their creativity so if theyare motivated to use the platform theycan use it they just have to comply tothe to the rules yeah excellent I thinkit's a great model you haveum so uhhow do you think about assessing thesuccess of initiatives right we justtalked a little bit about differentthings andum how do you decide whether somethinghas been successful you know Sam whydon't we start with yours yeah and Iguess it's a difficult question toanswer becausecompanies are at various differentstages of maturity and therefore how youmeasure success and the types ofqualification criteria success criteriamay be quite different butumessentially you know there are there areorganizations not that I'm going to nameright now that are delivering in excessof 100 million dollars of an economicvalue into their business per yearleveraging no code technology I meanthis is happening it's not this isn'tjust something that we you know four orfive years ago we were talking aboutthis as a hype this is that this is realnow like it's actually reality so Ithink it's just understanding likefor for people that are quite mature intheir organizations and what they'retrying to do then then there's going tobe mechanisms in place to be able totrack that value kpis and dashboards andall that kind of good stuff but but fora lot of you you know there isn't goingto be that so it's about where do youstart like you've got to start somewhereyou've got to be able to measure valuein in short little you know incrementalsteps to be able to then deliver thatbigger opportunity and take that upwardsyou know in the chain of command in yourorganization so there's different waysunconscious of time but I want Philippeto be able to have the time I thinkPhilippe you brought us actually a fewexamples of what some of these apps thatcome out of the process yeah just answeryour question in our case the successcan could be measure based on the numberof cities and developer for instancethat should grow uh in the time or theratio of published appscompared to uh prototypes and so on butthe the best answer to to speak aboutsuccess is uh within the area is to togo to concrete examples era you have atwo two concrete examples that have beenuh designed during uh last upshitapattern that we we did recently withinVilla the first one is about inventoryof safety equipment so we have manyplants within the the organizationthat's an industrial site we have safetyagreement on them before uh the thefront like workers have to to go on eachsafety equipment take a paper uh fearthe motorthe status the location and so on nothey just take their smartphone uh scana QR codeautomatically all the information justprovide the status by checking boxes andit's automatically injected in a live inthe database and goes on on thedashboard so at any time we can livehere the status of the inventory theotherexamplethat we have on app sheet is aboutvehicle Fleet inspection we have manyvehicles due to our activity it can betrucks for Waste correction for exampleandso before the driver has to fear a formand a paper with the time he'll comeback to the site if he had issuescrashes and so on no it just take asmartphone uh it's automaticallytimestampsif there is an issue you take a pictureof what what happens and the maintenanceteam is auto is directly notifiedwhen it submits a form and they can takethe decision if maintenance is a urgentmaintenance is necessary or not sothat's two recent example butfrom the early day of satawat so since2017we our front our field workersidentified quick wins based on justcollaborative tools a simple reallysimple use casesfor for instance on one side they theyuse the Google form to correct mattersit's automatically injected in aspreadsheet and you have a looker Studiothat provides a dashboard of the thestages another example is formulti-disciplinaryteams sites the manager has to create areport for each team after each brieflyDaily Briefing session no you just use acommon spreadsheet vertical screen inthe meeting room and they go through thetasks and automatically everybody theright flavor of information and even youcan share it to to the customer and thefeedback is that he is saved about onehour one hour on an hour per day so it'snot it's considerableand the last but not least it's simplyGoogle meet to avoid a manager which hasa multi-side to manage to be aconstantly on the road so the masterwords here are uh release time from whatmatter will be morebusiness-centrics more efficient in yourdaily activities and a great reminderthat digital transformation sometimesisn't very complex from the technologybut it can still have a huge impact nowum we are umbefore we come to questions kind of towrap this up I would love to hear kindof your thoughts your advice to to theaudience that you've taken away fromyour what you've learned that you wishyou would have known when you started somaybe Samyeah someone's really simple I would sayyou've got a think big enough andstrategic enough in terms of what's thevision where you're trying to get to andthis links back to my assessment conceptthat I've spoke aboutum cliche but you've got to start smallbecause you've got to do something nowright you can't think too far aheadyou've got to do something nowum everything that you do has to bemeasurable I mean this is just like abasic business case it's got to bemeasurable you've got to be able totrack something it's got to bequantifiable I see so many organizationsand people measure and it's so soft andthey go up to the CIO and suddenly it'slike well why doesn't come off theground it's because you haven't gotanything there right there's no clearnumbers and a clear caseum but also I would say think about thefusion Dynamic this is not about thebusiness and Frontline Workforce workingin isolation to I.T companies that havegot that figured out that kind ofHarmony that intersect are really doingsome interesting things right and I'mmore than happy to speak to folks afterabout some of those examples thank youSamPhilippe yeah so so first as I alreadymentioned keep watching uh technologyEvolution to always feed your digitaltoolbox andmake your users best equipped users andthe second is a query on board your userin the digital Journey make themresponsible provide them the right Toolsdigital tools to improve their dailyactivities they have plenty of ideas andthey are the best place to to know whichwhat has to be done to improve theirdaily activitiesbut always with keeping control on whatis done to avoid Shadow IDexcellent before we close there are abunch of sessions around workspace andapp sheet I think we have someone therein the QR code so um please if you wantto check out more about just how easy itis I know we are in the the workspaceshowcase as well you can see apps beingbuilt live there and then lastly ofcourse we always would love yourfeedback on what was good in thissession what really resonated with youso we can keep offering great sessionsthank you very much for attending andenjoy the rest of the show thank youthank you everybodyforeign"
