join youtoday we're introducing a new Cloudplatform our team is developing to buildextensions which help large languagemodels access real-time data andreal-world actionslarge language models are powerfulbut they're frozen in time aftertraining this means their knowledgebecomes stale and they can't dynamicallycall external servicesour new platform will change that byallowing developers to create Enterpriseextensions that securely connect llms tothe real worldMark will give you an overview of theplatform and how to create an extensionand then I'll share some early examplesof how developers can use our platformto create new an llm driven applicationshi everyoneso imagine that you're working at acompany and you have a new productlaunch coming up for a retail store andyou go to an AI chat bot and you ask canyou tell me more about the coverage forthis new retail storeyou're likely to get a response likethisI apologize but as an AI language modelI don't have real-time data and myknowledge only goes up to my trainingdate therefore I cannot provide specificinformation about events beyond thatdateI bet many of you seen texts like thisLMS can be very useful but they havesignificant limitationsfirst they are frozen in time they don'thave access to new data after theirfinal training date this leads to staleor inaccurate responses this also meansthat they can't access internal companyspecific data after training Foundationmodels are usually trained on publiclyavailable data but many organizationshave large troves of internal data theydon't like models to securely accessfinally they can't interact with theworld they can't access commoninterfaces like apis which limits theirability to take action for usersextensions also known as plugins helpaddress these problems by connecting LMSto apis effectively connecting them tothe real world and the first examplehere a search for press coverage on thecompany's latest launch triggers areal-time search to summarize the latestarticlesin the second example an employee wantshelp buying electronic components tobuild a new product that triggers thesupply chain extension to searchinventory in real time confirm thecomponent is available show the cost andcomplete the purchase in the appin the third example the employee askedthe company's deadline on benefitsenrollment the company's privateextension connects the llm to internalknowledge bases and gives the employee agrounded actionable answerwe see a world where LMS and apis arecombined to build sophisticatedextension powered applications thisincludes digital assistance that cancreate entire documents spreadsheets andprograms search engines that can providehighly personalized responses groundedin an Enterprise's context and automatedworkflows that can streamline many tasksin areas like data science and cybersecuritydespite the promise of extensions theyhave a number of challenges todayfirst developers lack effective tools tocreate test and deploy extensions inEnterprise environments we've talkedwith a number of developers that havecreated their own tools for tasks likeextension debugging and evaluation butthey would rather focus on work specificto their use casessecond model output from extensionsoften not accurate enough models toooften choose the wrong extension or thewrong output format reducing theirusefulness and making it harder to chainextensions together to solve complextasksthird extensions can access sensitivedata and actions creating new risksEnterprises need robust controls forsecurity privacy and compliancethat's why we're thrilled to announcevertex AI extensions a Google Cloudplatform to create Enterprise extensionsand extension powered applicationsvertex extensions will enableEnterprises to build extensions withGoogle Cloud's granular controls fordata access residency transparencyauditing and compliance with internalpolicies it will access Google's latestfoundational models that have beentrained on extension use cases it willalso integrate with the best of cloudservices such as bigquery and vertex AIsearch to build fully featuredapplicationswe see vertex extension as a corecomponent of a larger extensionecosystem that includes Enterprisesemployees developers and end userprofessionals and consumers wecategorize the benefits of extensionsinto two main categories internal usecases of making employees moreproductive by connecting llms to privatedata and actions and external use casesby extending your products and servicesinto AI surfaces outside your wallslet's dive into how you create anextension there are four steps firstselect an API that you want an llm toaccess if you want to create a new APIcheck out apogee Cloud's API ManagementService which is building tools toeasily generate apis and extensionssecond create two extension files amanifest that defines the extension'smetadata like its name description andauthentication and an API specificationthat defines which methods the LM canaccessthird test debug and publisher extensionusing vertex's developer tools andfinally deploy the extension in anapplication like a chat bot or anautomated workflowvertex extensions makes it easy tocreate and manage extensions you'll beable to create extensions through ourAPI or the cloud console and link toassets like logos and policies and cloudstorage our API spec format is based onthe open source open AF format and iscompatible with chat CPT plugins toimprove portability between ecosystemsI'll now hand it off to Julia who willtell you more about her extensiondeveloper tools and examples ofextension powered applicationsawesomeso I'm super excited to show a littlebit more about how you can use thesevarious tools to not just createdifferent extensions but also to browseand use extensionswith the platform you can build your ownextensions using your apis as Mark justdescribedyou could also use pre-built Googledextensions for popular Google cloudservices like bigquery alloy DB vertexAI search and code interpreteryou could also use partner extensionsfor a variety of different tasks such asdata retrieval with data stacks mongodband redis or you can deploy your Langchain code through vertex AI extensionsin the gallery you can browse discoverand test these different extensionsenabling developers to get startedquicklyyeahso now you've created that extension buthow do you make it usefulyou want to combine extensions and theassociated llms at the application layerto cover different use cases llms relyon their reasoning to decide if and whenan extension should be calledthis creates an agent operating in aruntimevertex AI extensions enables twodifferent types of application runtimesa reasoning application runtime that ismanaged by Google ensuring that theright extension is called and that theoutput format is controlledand a customizable application runtimethat builds on open source Frameworkslike langchain deployed the rec directlythrough vertex AI extensionsthese two options support differentlevels of customizationsupport and controlsbut as those of you well versed inmachine learning know creating andbuilding is only part of the journeyevaluating performance is critical toproduction grade applicationsso for this having the tools to createdata sets and run detailed evaluationsis crucialwith vertex AI extensions you'll soon beable to leverage a handful of your ownexample prompts to create testing datasetsusing those data sets you can then runexperiments to understand where issuesin the system ariseand to collect examples to supportrelevant extension executionthese tools are designed to help youunderstand your extension-basedapplications and how they're going toperformunderstanding potential issues enablesyour teams to take actions to configureand optimize your agentswith vertex AI extensions prompt toolingyou'll soon be able to test and optimizeyour extension manifest and APIspecificationwith llm configurations you'll be ableto test different models with yourextensions to ensure that you'rechoosing the optimal combinationthe goal is to give you the tools toensure that you have confidence in yourextension-based applicationsnow you've heard a lot about theplatform and you're probably thinkingthat the possibilities tend to seemendless of what you can do withextensions and I tend to agree andthat's why I'd like to focus on twoconcrete examples of how vertex AIextensions can be implemented in realworld workflowsretrieval augmented generation andcustom Enterprise applications for dataanalysisretrieval augmented generation is anindustry term that essentially meansusing data from an outside source tohelp the llm generate the correctresponseextensions can be incredibly powerfulfor this especially when they'recombined with your company's informationwhether you're a retailer looking togenerate a targeted ad campaign on thefly leveraging a consumer's loyaltyinformationor a security company monitoring andclassifying threats using extensionswill help you drive factuality andpersonalize the responses that are thatare shown to your userson the other hand vertex AI extensionscan Surface tools like code interpreterwherever they're most useful to you andyour usersso that you can analyze and understandand visualize different data sets oftenwithout even generating a single line ofcodenowI'd like to explore some of those realworld use cases in some early customerexamples but I'm going to give you allthe caveat the internet hasn't beenworking very well this morning so I amdoing all of the demos off my phoneinternet so pardon if they're a littlebit slower than originally planned andbear with me a little bitall right so the really exciting demoand story I get to tell today isactually together with the Formula Eteamat the end of July Formula E put theirdata their New Gen beta race car theindustry's fastest lightest and mostpowerful and Efficient Electric car andRacers Jake Hughes from McLaren andLucas Degrassi from Mahindra racing tothe test in an attempt to set a newGuinness world record for the fastestspeed achieved by a vehicle indoorsthe two Racers drove the Jen better cara revolutionary Formula E electric racecar on an indoor track in London andover three attempts Hughes was actuallyable to break the world recordbut not only is this a testament to thetechnological innovations of Formula Eand their gen better car vertex AI ongcp actually provided the analysis ofeach of the drivers runsusing the vertex platform Hughes andDegrassi were able to interpretreal-time Telemetry data to understandspeed power and gripthis gave them the ability to interactand Converse in natural language tofine-tune their different approachesnow let's check out the system that theywere actually able to interact with andgo to the demo pleaseyep all rightsoso let's speak with let me put my racinghat on here and let's speak with Jenbetterfirst off you can think of you can thinkabout eraser just having finished one oftheir specific laps so I'm actuallygoing to switch over to the driver modehere one momentand I would like to understand maybe alittle bit more about what my speed andG-Force was exiting the last left cornerWhat's Happening Here in the backgroundis actually the sensoric informationfrom the car is being streamed via Pubsub into bigquery to make it availableto the vertex AI llms and as you can seemy speed was 59.88 and G-Force was 1.271exiting the last left cornernow I might want to askwhat was my maximum G-Forceagain we're making a call out tobigquery in the background to ensurethat we're generating and the relevantinformation for the specific drivers sothat they can adjust their variousattemptsand finally given that this is anelectric race carI might want to ask what was my batterycapacity when I reached the top speedthis is particularly interesting as a asa driver of electric car because youwant to be ensuring that you're using asmuch of that battery as possibleso what you can see here is that we'reessentially making the informationavailable to the drivers in naturallanguage so that they can adjust theirvarious attempts across the system andto give you a little bit of a peekbehind the scenes I'll actually take youinto the bigquery Telemetry data so youcan see the response from the lastquestion as you can see the speed tendsto get faster and then we end up with7.7 which is exactly what we were toldthe battery capacity was at the topspeednow Formula E was really really excitedabout this and they didn't just want togive the drivers a new experience theyalso wanted to give their fans a newexperience and so they created what weknow as the fan bot were they hooked upvertex AI search in the backgroundfilled it with some of their informationabout Formula E about their history andabout the Gen beta car to create a newinteractive experience for their fanssolet's talk to the fanbot and learn alittle bit more about the race carsas I just shared the system is reachingout in the background to Enterprisesearch to learn a little bit more aboutthe car and in this case it's gen bettais a Next Generation formula ecar it'sstill under development but it's alreadybroken the indoor land speed record itcan has a top speed of 200 miles perhour which is pretty interesting andit's faster than the previousgenerations of Formula E carsnow I'm also curious what is the g-forcethat you actually put on your driversthis is interesting because I just wantto learn a little bit more about whatkind of stress the body is under whenyou're in this race car and so as youcan see the driver is put under ag-force of 2.5 that's pretty coolbut now I'd like to test its creativeskills and I'd like to understand alittle bit more about what it's like tobe inside the world's fastest caras you can see it's an incrediblefeeling to be inside the world's fastestcarit's a real Rush of adrenalineespecially when you're able to go fastin such a confined space and boy am Iglad that the demo played alongespecially when I'm streaming things onmy phone so I'm definitely feeling thatRush of adrenaline right now as wellall right if we could go back to theslides I'd love to give you all a littlebit of a sense of what's going on underthe hoodnow that we've had this chance to speakwith Jen betterthe initial Focus here was on creatingtwo different Botsone that would enable the racer tointeract with the data on bigqueryand the other bot that would enable thefans to interact based on vertex AIsearchfor the first versionthe Google Cloud CE team a huge shoutout to this team by the way workingtogether with Formula E put together ademo structure using langchain and thevarious components across the gcp stackwhile the team was able to get things upand running really quickly the biggestchallenge turned out to be deploying thecode on a gke cluster as well as thecomplex prompt management needed forretrieval accuracyand that's where vertex AI extensionscomes in in the second version which youactually just saw running todaythe team was able to quickly and easilyclick to deploy their launching code andllm configurations through theextensions platform to get an HTTPendpoint embedded in the UI that you sawthis helped simplify the architectureand ultimately significantly cut down onthe develop on the development timeas Formula E looks for ways to integratethis experience into their next seasonwe're building together towards of E3bringing together the components as partof the vertex AI extensions platform tocreate a common experience for the racerand fan backed by production gradesecurity privacy and traceability on gcpas well as supported by vertex managedreasoning to drive consistencynow that we've got a betterunderstanding of how a customer coulddeploy Langton code on vertex AIextensions let's explore some additionalretrieval augmented generation use casesvertex AI extensions doesn't need to bein the classical chat interface that wesee everywhere todaycustomers like Manhattan and gitlab arelooking to leverage the vertex platformto create their own workflowsManhattan Associates a recognized leaderin supply chain technology is looking toleverage vertex AI extensionsto optimize Warehouse operationsthey believe generative AI has the powerto provide unparalleled automatedinsightsfor supply chain managers andprofessionalsbut only with the ability to ingesttheir internal apis to pass data atproduction or at scale and in productionthey hope to use vertex AI extensions tobalance labor assignmentsbased on real-time utilization open workand deadlines to automate supply chainprocessesas someone who got into the into SupplyChain management during covid-19 I'mparticularly excited about this aboutthis use casegitlab on the other hand hopes toleverage vertex AI extensions toincrease the accuracy of their latestfeature supporting developers inresolving vulnerabilitieshere they'd like to have the llm haveaccess to security remediation knowledgeas well as potentially the user-specificcode base so that they can provide moretailored accurate and personalizedinformation to the user and get them ontheir way quicklywe're super excited about all of thesedifferent use cases and have many moreof them to share with you butas we transition retrieval augmentedgenerationis not just the only thing that becomeseasier and more powerful with vertex AII'm particularly excited to share howdata understandinganalysis and visualization can betransformed leveraging the databaseswhere you have your data in conjunctionwith the power of co-generation andexecutionmany Industries have huge amounts ofdata that they've collected over theyears after five years at Google I'veseen all this data but it's largely beenleft to specialized data sciencefunctions and machine learning Engineersto make use of it because of the complexprocesses that are associated as you cansee on the left or on the right of theslideleveraging vertex AI extensions the goalis to unlock all of these different usecases and allow those that don'tnecessarily know how to codeto actually interact with the data innatural language across any kind ofindustry to answer questions likewhat was the average fuel economy of myfleet over the last six monthsor in the farming space what nutrientmix did I provide to my wheat Fieldsthis yearor in the retail industry how much of aspecific product at a specific locationwas sold in the last 12 monthsthese and many more questions are onesthat we'd like to enable customers toget answers to and not just in theclassical data science and machinelearning functionsthat's why with vertex AI extensionscode interpreter you can implement theability to analyze and visualize datawherever it's most useful to you andyour userswhether that's a chat interface an IDEor a different UI you can make it usefulto your users in the way that's usefulto youby connecting your data extensions youcan then safely access the internet andan Enterprise secureprivacy compliant and scalable waynow let's jump into a quick exampleand since it's hard to surface the powerof an API you'll see some of thesevisualizations and mocks to help outlinesome of the concepts the answers and thecode generated are however generatedfrom the underlying tools and we willactually jump in just to get a sense forwhat's going on under the hoodto illustrate this example I'mparticularly excited to actually beusing a real data set from my family whoare Avid beekeepers and this is datathat we've collected over the years fromour different beehivesso let's assume that a developer hascreated this chat interface for me usingvertex AI extensions code interpreterhere you can allow your users to uploada file as I'm going to door to connect to a database instancelike bigqueryhere I'm choosing to Simply upload a CSVwith the data about my beehivesnext I'd want to add prompt informationabout the data so I probably don't havea great sense of what data is actuallyin this spreadsheet that I've uploadedand so I'd like to understand what allthe different headers are that I can beasking aboutso I've askedum what the different headers are and asyou can see it correctly generates thecode to understand those headers showingme hey there's wait some timetemperatureEtc available to menowI'd like to understand how the weight ofthe hive is changing over time so that Ican figure out when I should harvest thehoneyand to ensure that the bees have enoughhoney to survive over the winterso I'll ask code interpreter how theweight changed over timeas you can see from this naturallanguage query it's generated the codeto visualize that image now let's take aquick jump into the code and actuallylook at what the code that was generatedif you could switch to the demoperfectso as you can see herewe imported various libraries first offwe then read the data from the CSV filedid some filtering extracted someinformation and then sorted by the dateand the timeplotted the weight over time and thenset the title and access labels so thatI would know what's going on in thechart and ultimately showed that plot tousif we go back to the slidesthis image is great but there is oneproblem with it there are two prettysignificant outliers that makes it hardfor me to actually see the chart the thecourse of the the data over the graphand so I'd like to ask code interpreterto remove these two outliersso I'll ask since there are outliers canyou remove themgreat this is a much better picture Ican see the weight over time much moreclearly and let's again jump into thecodeso if we could switch to the demothere we goso here you can seethat it's added to critical pieces onecalculate the upper and lower bounds forthe outliers and then two filter thedata within those upper and lower boundsif we go back to the demouh back to the slides excuse meyou can see this uh this looks great andit definitely looks like it's time toharvest some of that honeyum as you can see I actually do we doactually have bees and this is our ownhoney so super excited to be able to usethis data to show you this use casenow as you can see vertex AI extensionsis designed to enable these experiencesand many more we're super excited toallow our developers to create buildevaluate and optimize their llm and llmpowered extension applications in theplaces where they need the mostbut I have to say that this wouldn't bepossible without the support of theFantastic Team that is behind Mark andmyself and so this is a quick shout outto them thank you all so much for yourhard work and super excited to keepbuilding on this platform to explore thevarious use cases together with ourcustomers and for that we'd love for youto stay in the loop to share your usecase with us and to do so make sure yousign up on that linkand then make sure you're signed up forthe vertex AI trusted tester programum which also your gcp salesrepresentative should be able to helpyou with if you do have any questionsthank you very much thank you all somuch[Applause][Music]"
