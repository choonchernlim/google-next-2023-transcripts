everyone I'm Annie maWeaver I'm the product manager for highperformance Computing and I'm reallyexcited to be hereawesome so we have a few topics for youtoday we're going to level set first ofall about what HPC is and why it'simportant to several Industries secondhow we're helping HPC customers thriveon Google Cloud third what we're doingto advance the HP state-of-the-art HPCstate-of-the-art excuse me on Googlecloud and then finally how you can goand deploy your own HPC environments endto end on Googleso to get started let's talk about whatHPC is and why it's so important for somany different Industriesso organizations across many differentIndustries are really facing atremendous growth of data and demand toprocess that data right this is just afew Industries uh but you know you'veseen advances in medicine recently thatmean more new drugs are coming to Marketevery year and in fact the FDA isapproving more new drugs each year andsince 2010 than they had in any previousdecade so you know do you see it in drugDiscovery you see it in genomics you seeit in brain simulations and Health Carelife sciences and financial services youknow the the variable markets that we'vebeen seeing over maybe the last fewyears combined with increased regulatoryrequirements and compliance requirementshas really driven the financialinstitutions that we rely on tore-examine the the tools and themechanisms they have to process thatdata right to do things like Riskanalysis and then manufacturingIndustries are really struggling to putdata to use in production right most uhin a lot of Industries I should say havemanufacturing Industries have found thatthey they can't really use data at scalein their manufacturing and this you knowobviously doesn't cover public sector ormedia entertainment retail or a numberof other Industries where HPC is isgrowing very very quickly to to meet thedemands of you know all of these factorssoum why are people looking at HPC rightHPC offers Business Leaders theopportunity to speed up the processingof the Deluge of data that they'reseeing and to get the results thatthey're looking for faster while stillcontrolling costs right we were just ina meeting uh where I heard yet againI've heard this from so many customersthat they had a decision to make at somepoint between building out anon-premises HPC infrastructure to solveone of their tasks this was a financialservices industry to so to do the riskanalysis that they needed for theRegulatory Compliance it would have costabout 20 million dollars to build out anHPC system that would have lasted themyou know maybe five or seven years butwould have done the task on the otherhand they could run that in a and GoogleCloud's HPC for half a million dollars ayear right so that kind of decision iseasy to make when that's the themathematics that you're looking at rightum so you know scalability HPC does doeswhat it does by scaling workloads acrossmultiple resources by scaling up and outand distributing that work then acrossall of those resources and parallelizingthat work to speed up the work beingdone while maintaining costshowever the the idea of implementing HPCon-premises has its limitations rightthis is what people have been doing foryears and we've really hit the thelimits um I think the the systems thatpeople design for HPC systems are builtin fixed amounts right so you decide atsome point you want 100 000 cores 10 000cores whatever it is however many gpusand that's the system that you go andprocure and install and it takes youknow up to a year to go through the theprocess of you know putting out an RFPif you do that talking with vendorsarchitecting your system getting itbuilt and and shipped and then doingacceptance testing right some of thereally large systems take a long longtime to to get approved and they'rebuilt on this multi-year refreshschedule right so you have every five orseven years you can look at a new set ofHardware whereas you might already betwo or three generations out of date onthe latest gpus for example and users ina shared system typically wait behindother users multiple other users in aqueue right for access to thoseresources because it's you know it'svery expensive to build out an HPCsystem to handle all the work that youmight possibly need that that system todo right and we'll talk about a coupleusers and and why they how they've seenthatum but you know waiting behind otherusers limits the amount of work you cando limits time to Innovation time toresults for manufacturing right and inIndustries where you're trying to cometo Market with something firstthat can be devastating right not beingable to to get your results in the timethat you needum and when organizations look atmigrating their workloads to the cloudit gets sometimes even more paralyzingright the amount of uh work that youneed to do to move to the cloud thepotential cost not just of the move butof re-platforming any tools and trainingusers can be daunting right can seemintimidatingluckily for everyone here and everyoneelse Google cloud has an HPC platformthat has a full spectrum of easy to useproducts tools and Integrations for youto run your HPC workloads really reallyeasily and cost efficiently on GoogleCloudso that includes our infrastructurefirst on the left with the latestprocessors and accelerators reliabilityand security built in high performancestorage options which we'll talk alittle bit more about and highthroughput low latency networkingbetween VMSon top of that we layer our platformright our HPC tools and services thiscovers things like our simple batchservice which is our managed schedulerfor simple batch workloads that coversthe Google kubernetes engine that wehave for containerized workloads andwe'll talk a little bit about how that'scome up to speed for HPC and it's notjust a web serving platform anymore andit includes our Cloud HPC toolkit whichwe'll talk about more as well andfinally we support a broad partnerecosystem of Partners across isvs systemproviders system software providers solike schedulers and storage and thensystem integrators as well to make surethat customers can bring the thesoftware that they're used to to GoogleCloud without the need to re-platform ifit doesn't make sense and that they havethe partners there to help themImplement thatso how have we helped users of GoogleCloud HPC platform actually thrive onGoogle Cloud right to answer thatquestion I want to look at threeIndustries and three different storiesfrom those Industriesso first is higher education rightAcademia the University of California isa great example excuse me the Universityof California Riverside is a greatexample where researchers were facingthe the very common challenge in HPC ofhigh demand for limited resources rightI mentioned queuing uh behind otherusers and that's that's exactly whatthey face they also face the challengeof a traditional academic researchenvironment where multiple researchershave multiple interests multiple jobsand you can never really tell how muchanyone's going to need at any one timeor when they're going to need it rightthey might just show up you might get anew pi and this happens all the timewhere people bring in a new principalinvestigator and they get a lot of moneyand they need a lot of compute all of asudden right so what UC Riverside didwas they combined two key components tosolve this issue first is the cloud HPCtoolkit which we'll talk about a littlebit later and second is the Google Cloudpublic sector subscription agreement sothe public sector subscription agreementis a fixed cost subscription model forpublic sector users who are running HPCworkloads and it's specifically built toaddress the bursty needs of HPCworkloads right again you can neverreally tell if somebody's going to login on the weekend and spin up a largejob or something like that so you haveto be ready right to to flex and torespond to customers needs and that'sreally the point of the cloud of coursebut the cost variability associated withthat can be challenging right often inacademic environments they're working onfixed grants or you know multi-yearbudget timelines and they can't justFlex that cost so the public sectorsubscription agreements gives them afixed cost where you can even go abovethe predetermined amount of resourcesthat you get with your commitment and wewon't charge you extra for that so it'sespecially built for HPC users in thepublic sector industryum do you see the CIO of UC Riversidehas even said that by combining thepublic sector subscription agreement andthe Google Cloud HPC toolkit they'reable to offer their researchersopportunities that they would not getoutside of UC Riverside and without thistechnology so we're really proud of thatcomputer-aided engineering is anothervery heavyweight workload in HPC rightand it covers multiple uh differentworkloads computer computational fluiddynamics Structural Engineering allthese sorts of things you might be alittle more familiar withum and it's it's a workload where theHPC worked on can directly impact thetime to market for a company right thinkabout your pixel phone or you know yourcar right doing the the drop simulationsand the crash simulations and makingsure that it's safe where it's not goingto crack it's important to before goingto Market so being able to do thosesimulations faster than anyone else isis important when you're in a timecrunchso what we did was uh we partnered witha number of isvs but Altera is one ofthe key isvs in the CAE space and we ransome benchmarks with them on our latestand greatest H3 VMS which Annie willtalk about more and they found that theywere able to speed up the simulationruntimes of one of their most popularCIA applications radios by up to 3xversus the last generation of HPC VMtypes so that kind of performanceImprovement for Altair's customersreally makes a difference in terms ofyou know being able to do work right ifa engineer had to wait a day to get asimulation done now they can do three ina day right that's the kind ofdifference that we're talking about hereum and then finally drug Discovery is uhyou know tremendously computationallycomplex workload in HPC uh it requiresvast amounts of data and a significantnumber of iterations over that data inorder to do the kind of drug Discoveryuh and and chemical Library sort ofscreening that they need to do andSchrodinger is is one of our customersthey've been a customer of ours for along time but they found the HPCplatform at Google Cloud as as a perfectsource of that computing power that theyneed and they've been able to exploremore chemical compounds using GoogleCloud than they ever have been before soyou know opening up the the scale andthe scope of what customers can do intheir own industries by offering themmore and better HPC resources is isreally our goal and they found that youknow the request to Google Cloud to spinup tens of thousands of gpus wasn't anissue and that really really helped themdo their workso to now they understand you know whatour customers are doing today and howthey're thriving I'm going to hand itover to Annie to dive into how we'readvancing the state of the art with HPCon Google Cloud greathi everyone I am delighted to tell youabout our CPUs gpus and storage productannouncements and the reason we findthis exciting is that it will help ourHPC customers more easily deploy GoogleCloud resources to start solving ourproblems at scale in a cost performancemannerour hpsc platform consists of threelayers of cloud infrastructuredeployment and development Cloudinfrastructure compute storagenetworking you know it you love it I'mgoing to tell you more about itdevelopment includes our built-indevelopment tools including ourcommunication libraries like nickel andMPIour infrastructure management toolingfinally there's deployment whichincludes amazing products like the cloudHBC toolkit the hvcvm image and batchwe coordinate offerings across computenetworking storage and work withpartners and open source projects todevelop end-to-end solutions for yourhvc needsthis is a gorgeous slide I recommend youI see some people taking pictures pleasedo it's very niceI like to share some new compute enginevirtual machines that are built for HBCfirst Google compute engine or GCEprovides VM families to suit yourworkload needs whether they are moregeneral purpose or Mission criticalhighly performance intensiveour C3 machine series is now generallyavailablethese are built on the Intel fourthgeneration sign let's see if I can saythe scalable processor codenamedSapphire Rapids and are available forour GCE and gke customersto further support our customers andAdvance our commitment to workloadoptimized infrastructure we arelaunching our new H3 virtual machineSeries so we actually launched this acouple weeks ago and I wanted to see bya show of hands have you guys heard ofthis beforeokay all right okay for those who raisetheir hands please come up and you cantalk more about itokay so the H3 series is our firstmachine series that is optimized for HPCit is again built on Sapphire Rapids andtakes advantage of our Google Cloudcustom Intel infrastructure ProcessingUnit or iputhe H3 is an addition to our computeoptimized VM family which includes theC2 and c2dsH3 has shown performance improvementsover prior generation c2s for a numberof key HBC use cases including molecularDynamics Eda weather forecasting andmorethe h3s offer 200 gigabyte per seconddefault low latency networking which istwo times the prior generationit also offers up to three timesImprovement in per node performanceagain compared to the c2s and we're notknocking the c2s they are phenomenal butthe h3s are truly a step forwardwe also have seen two times better priceperformance versus the c2s and we'veworked with leading Partners like Altairansys parallel Works to create the bestexperience for HPC customers and I knowwhy I just talked about some of thosebenchmarks that we ran with Altairnext I want to talk to you aboutsomething that is in the news I'm sureyou've heard you're probably sick ofhearing about it but AIML what are wedoing thereso we have the A3 supercomputers whichwill be generally available next monthand these supercomputers arepurpose-built to train and serve themost advanced machine learning modelsand these models they are poweringtoday's generative Ai and large languagemodeling Innovation I'm sure at thispoint you've heard about gen Ai and llmso many times that it could be adrinking gamehavehere are some key features of the a3sthey are powered on eight Hopper 100Nvidia gpus and they show up to threetimes higher performance for AI trainingversus the prior generation a2s as wellas 10 times Network10 times Network bandwidth increasethe Nvidia Collective Communicationslibrary or nickel is built for deeplearning Frameworks like tensorflow andpytorch and is used for multi-node andmulti-gpu trainingfast socket is a Google proprietaryNetwork transport built for nickel andwe've seen an increase in net bandwidthspeeds using fast socket because of itsability to decrease contention betweenmultiple TCP connectionsin fact we've seen up to 60 Improvementin all reduced throughputfor those interested in setting up afast socket environment you can eitheruse a deep learning VM image or acompute engine Public Imagecompacts placement reduces latency byplacing nodes in closer proximity and iswell suited for tightly coupled batchworkloads it can be specified at thenode pool or cluster levelthe cued resource manager or qrm is away for customers to request VMinstances of scarce resources like gpusonce you have put in your request you'llget either a high confidence responseabout whether your request can befulfilled and by when or an immediateresponse that your request cannot befulfilledthis way you can better manage yourcapacity demandsnext I'm excited to share an Innovativeaddition to our storage portfolio forHPCbut first we have the right storage foryour processing typeeither through our native offerings orpartner Integrationsmoving and storing your data on Googlecloud is quick and easyas I like to say to my four-year-old youtake care of The Logical that Mama worryabout the physicalit does not land that well with herI am so pleased to announce the launchof our first party parallel file systemparallel store built on the Intel Davisstorage stackand for those on the live stream which Iknow you are there I want to say thankyou so much to the parallel storeengineering team you guys did such greatwork we're really proud of youparallel store is semi-scrash with a GCSdurable layer and it will be used toaccelerate high performance applicationsthat require both High scale and lowlatency data accessI want to share with you some Benchmarkresultsin particular I want to highlight thesub millisecond latency and the readthroughput of up to three 6.3 times ofAWS FSX for luster scratch Baseline Ialso want to highlight the high MD Opswhich helps supportemerging i o patterns and also AIMLpatternsparallel store is now available inprivate preview which means that ifyou're interested in using it please letus know so that we can make sure thatyou have accessand actually on that note I'm going togo back a couple slides to H3 becauseI've forgot to emphasize the mostimportant thing which is that it is nowavailable in public preview which meansif you want to access it today you canfind it in the cloud console but if youwant to start testing please let us knowso we can provision you adequatecapacityand public preview means that it's freeof charge for you to usenow I want to tell you about some waysthat you can deploy HPC resources onGoogle Cloudof course you can build it from scratchyourself and I know many of you arecapable of doing that but we alsorecommend that you consider some of thetools herefor those who want to quickly customizeand deploy an hvc environment withpartner Integrations built in we havethe cloud hvc toolkit which I will gointo more detail about shortlygke is ideal if you want a platform tomanage or containerize applications itgives you the operational power ofkubernetes while maintaining andmanaging a lot of the underlyingcomponents like control plane and nodesfor youlast but not least Google Cloud batch itis a first party Cloud native fullyintegrated batch scheduler so that youcan schedule queue and execute resourcesfor your batch processing workloadsproductstoolkitthe cloud HPC toolkit is a modularcomposable collection of resourceswritten in terraform to help you quicklyand easily deploy repeatable TurnKeyenvironments that have the Google Cloudhvc best practices built inthe toolkit has three key componentsfirst blueprints which is exactly whatit sounds like the design for your HPCsystemblueprints can be general purposeworkload specific or built around apartner solutionlucky for you the toolkit comes with anumber of example blueprints which youcan use to customize or give youinspiration for building something anewthe blueprints and reference modules ofthe toolkit supportsmodules break down into categories likestorage and schedulersand the modular modules then Deploy onGoogle infrastructure to start runningyour HBC systemsall right here is an example blueprintor yaml file with about 60 lines of codegive you a moment to take that inthis is actually what it looks like Iknow everyone is shockedthe blueprint is then used to create adeployment artifact which is a folderthat has about three or four thousandlines of codeand that deployment artifact is thenused to deploy an HBC system which canbe forty thousand five plus lines ofcode so for those who are doing the mathyou go from a simple yaml file of about60 lines all the way up to 40 000 pluslines of Deployable code but you don'thave to write it and that's wheretoolkit simplifies thingssetting up your HPC cluster if you hadto write all that code yourself wouldhave taken days and weeks but now withthe toolkit you can get that up andrunning in minutes and hoursnow I'm going to turn it back over toWyatt who's going to tell you about someother ways to deploy hvc systems gke andbatchthanks Annie yeahsoum just a reminder before I jump intogke and batch that the cloud HPC toolkitis not only capable of deploying Googlecompute engine resources like the slurmcluster blueprint you saw earlier butit's also able to deploy Googlekubernetes engine resources batchresources or a number of other resourcessingle VM dashboards in our op Suitethere's a there's a number of modulesthat make it really easy to build anentire end-to-end HPC environmentregardless of the the software stackthat you're using uh so Googlekubernetes engine is a really greatoption for running any of your HPCworkloads or AI workloads for thatmatter that are containerized right it'snot the only option you can definitelyrun containers on VMS and that gives youa little bit more flexibility but gke isis really great for eliminating the needto worry about the infrastructure layerthe security the maintenance any of thatrightwe've done a lot of work on gke recentlyI think most people are familiar withkubernetes as a web hosting platform andyou know in complete honesty that'sdefinitely what it was until recentlywe've done a lot of work over the lastyear year and a half or so to implementa number of features that I'll describethat really change the the way youshould look at kubernetes and thinkabout kubernetesuh in regards to HPC so um this includesfeatures like Q so Q is actually acontribution back to the kubernetes opensource but Q implements the basicconcepts that we're familiar with in HPCof jobs job scheduling job prioritiesand dependencies and job cues so itallows users to fair share capacitybetween gke nodes and node pools and itlets you implement the things you'reused to in HPC environments like jobpolicies per user or per job like Imentioned priorities and and othersimilar capabilities that you wouldexpect out of basically any HPC jobschedulersharing uh at optimizing gpus on GK isanother feature that we've introduced tohelp optimize the performance of HPC andAI workloads as well as the theutilization right utilization is a veryimportant thing in HPCum and so making sure that you're notleaving you know Cycles on the table isis really important so we added you knowfeatures like nvidia's multi-instancegpus that lets you split out a GPUacross multiple instancesmulti-process service time sharingbetween gpus and that all allows you tosplit up and share gpus better acrossmultiple jobs or multiple usersand just make more efficient use ofespecially the really large gpus thatwe're starting to see more and more oftodayumthen there's also uh nickel nickel fastsocket and Annie described what nickelis so I won't get into the details butum nickel fast socket basically allowsyou to accelerate those distributedoperations like all Reduce by up toabout 60 in some cases and that's reallyimportant I'm sure you're familiar withHPC use cases but also more and moredistributed AI training use cases whichoftentimes use a lot of traditional HPCtechnologyum nickel fast socket works better thanany that better than ever in a compactplacement policy right so you sawcompact placements earlier that worksfor Google compute engine as well asGoogle kubernetes engineum and then qrm is also supported inacute Resource Management excuse me it'salso supported in gke to allow you toensure that you can have access to theGPU resources on a compact placementpolicy and make efficient use of themwhen you need them right and you're notyou know maybe looking around forcapacity or waiting for capacityGK has also expanded a number the numberof VMS and nodes that they support in apool so they actually have 3x the numberof 15 000 nodes in a cluster so threetimes what other managed kubernetesServices provide or or allow you toscale up toum and you know that's really importantfor customers like bear who are able torun 15 billion genotypes per hour nowthat they've been able to scale up tothis you know crazy level in gke butit's also important for customers likepgs uh who are not only able to migrateoff of their on-premises traditionalcray based supercomputer environmentright cray is one of the oldest runningHPC providers and system providers inthe worldum and so they moved off of their crayand luster file system environment toGoogle cloud and then they moved to GK agke based environment and with GoogleCloud Storage instead of a parallel filesystemand in doing so they built what could bea system that Rivals the top systems inthe world right so there's this top 500list and so pgs built themselves a gkebased supercomputer that uh you knowreally put gke to the tests and it wasawesome to see they passed 2.8 millionvcpus in a single environment 180000 gke nodes and if they benchmarkedthat with the standard HPC Benchmarkcalled linpak they would have reachedabout 72 petaflops of computing powerthat would have placed them at the topseven the number seven top supercomputerin the world at the time if they hadactually taken the time to Benchmark itand you know weren't using it for moreimportant thingsum but you know that just goes todemonstrate the the scalability and theremarkable power that gke has now andthat it's not just a web hostingplatform anymoreforeignbatch is another great solution for HPCworkloads especially where your primarygoal is getting your work done asquickly as possible without having toworry about anything elseso I I say that because batch is ourfully managed zero Ops schedulingservice built for and by Googleum so the the Zero apps part isimportant so it's really designed forusers to really easily run their HPCworkloads out of the box without needingto understand the complexities of atraditional scheduler environment righthave to worry about data too much andwithout additional complexity or costright this is a free service on top ofthe resources that you use and it'sum you know something that supportscontainers you could use it withoutcontainers and supports all of our HPCstorage options it's also very tightlyintegrated as you can see with a lot ofour first party and third-party workflowengines so you can use it with all ofour tools like the toolkit with ourworkflows and our scheduler composerwill be supported very shortly as wellnext monthum and almost more importantly is theIntegrations with the third partyworkflow managers soum for anybody who's in the healthcareand Life Sciences industry you might befamiliar with the next flow workflowmanager that is basically one of themost popular workflow managers inum really genomics processing butHealthcare and Life Sciences in generaland so we've built a really tightintegration with next flow where usersof nextflow can actually deploy directlyto batch just point next flow to batchas their endpoint and without having toeven interact with batch or send youknow configure anything in batch theycan just go and deploy a job directlyfrom next flow so that's the kind ofease and simplicity we're looking todrive with with batch where Cloud HPCtoolkit lets you get in you know line byline and edit things and run scripts andconfigure tuning and you know maximumconfigurability batch is as simple as itcan get right so if you have you knowresearchers or people who are justlooking to get their science done whoaren't too concerned about the computerscience batches where you should sendthem there are many ways to build jobdefinitions so we support uh everythingfrom simple Json at the uh you know mostuh fundamental level all the way throughto a web-based cloud console where youcan go and click through and you knowunderstand what your options are withouthaving to read through some manuals orwhatnot and moreover jobs can really beeasily visualized in the cloud consolethere you can see the top image whichI'm sorry is cut off has a listing ofjobs there and so you can really easilyeasily monitor jobs and you know batchwill make sure that your jobs run it'llre-cue jobs if there are issues supportspot and all of the features that youwould expect batch to to support out ofthe box and you know despite how simpleit is uh it's really a feature-rich HPCscheduler right so it supports all thefeatures you'd expectum supports you know high throughputjobs or HTC jobs it supports tightlycoupled jobs like MPI it supports jobretries and priorities custom VM imageswhich can be really important for a lotof folks you know Regional placementpolicy which is key in bulk API compactplacement qrm all of these sorts ofthings that I that we have talked aboutthroughout the the talk as well as anumber of our HPC storage options andthe the CSI driver for uh parallel storewill be coming shortly as well I'm sorrythe CSI driver for gke will be comingshortlyumsoumyeahall this work is really part of the HPCstrategy that we have overall and that'sbeen guiding our work for the lastseveral yearsum and so that's really broken down intofour key pillars first is fast andaffordable speaks to the infrastructureright the the new H3 and A3 VMS theactual infrastructure that we buildparallel store and our networkingand making sure that all of thosecomponents work really well for HPCworkloads right so that the the CPUworks well with the networking and canrun MPI applications as quickly aspossibleum and then that gets into easy andcompatible so that's about our platformmaking sure that you know I mentionedthings like our bulk API that allow youto spin up a thousand VMS per API callthose kinds of features that allow youto to do the HPC things that you need todo efficientlyum are what we're aiming to do with oureasy and compatible as well as beingcompatible with the leading applicationproviders and schedulers and systemsoftware providers and so that gets intopartner preferred we really want if yougo to one of your partners and say Heyyou know we're looking at moving to thecloud who would you recommend we wantthem to say Google first right so we'reworking with as many partners as we canto ensure that their applications arebenchmarked and are qualified andcompatible with Google cloud and that ifwhenever possible they perform betterthan other Cloud providers andon-premises so you'll see morecompetitive benchmarks from us soon thatalso goes for the schedulers and thestorage as well as the systemintegrators right the folks who you'llbring in to actually help you implementthese workloads and then finally it'sabout uh you know bringing the best ofGoogle so that's our industry expertisewe've had customers where we've broughtthe folks who are building the alphafold ml models or the Deep variantmodels we bring them into theconversation right we have Eda customerswhere we bring the folks who aredesigning our TPU chips to them and sayyou know share how you run on Googlecloud with with our customer so thatkind of industry expertise we definitelywant to bring to you and and make surethat you can learn from us and that welearn from you at the same time leadingML and data analytics tools you know umjust a a brief idea of this you can dumpall of your job scheduler logs intobigquery and then you can use bigqueryml to understand you know how a user isrunning their jobs when they mostfrequently run their jobs what theaverage cost is so these are the kindsof ways we're looking to integrate tradeML and data analytics into our HPCenvironment right top to bottom and thenyou know making sure that the technologythat we bring to bear whether it's ourworldwide Network or kubernetes or otherthings really works well for HPC and soyou know one of my favorite examples isthe uh the lsst project or it's callednow the virusy Reuben Observatory it'sthe largest telescope in the world it'sbuilt on a mountain in Chile and theyprocess 20 terabytes of astronomicaldata at night over the Google CloudNetwork off the mountain in Chile overour worldwide distributed Network up tothe U.S central zone where it'sprocessed and then distributed outaround the world for researchers toexamine so that kind of scientificworkload where you need to Transit datayou know halfway across the worldovernight and then distribute it aroundthe rest of the world is where thingslike our worldwide Network come intoplayso with that I really hope that youenjoyed our talk today we really hopeyou enjoy the rest of the week and wehope you're able to attend some of ourother talks that are related to HPC andAIML workloads and please go see ourpartners we've got a number of greatPartners down there in the in theShowcase and definitely go visit thosepuppies I'm gonna I'm gonna go downthere right nowuh oh and uh we really appreciatefeedback here at Google uh hopefully youall realize that we we really actuallylike if you submit a bug somebody seesit and I've I've plus one and and echoedbugs that you know have come in from theoutside so please please please give usfeedback that not only goes for bugswith our products but also for oursessions so um if you have a minuteplease go ahead and get feedback in theapp we'd really appreciate it and withthat I want to thank you all so much andsay enjoy the rest of the week[Applause]"
