the CEO for Onyx and Ihave the privilege of leading Onyx asone of the Google Cloud's Premierpartnerum how many times in your lifetime doyou get to participate and know aninnovators want to change the worldreservancetodaywith canoe and we end with n and withTony what is trying to do is going tochange the game in the in the world interms of how Transportation industryWorks foreverand uh and I always believe one of my myit was when I do businesses with leadersacross the world is that not only whatthe leaders leader does in terms ofbusiness but who he really is andAntonio I've known Tonyfor the last many months and in Tony'sapproach to doing business is verydifferent than many other people I'veseen out there Tony has a has a do adifferent approach when it comes toinnovationhe he believes in using naturereverence for nature in the designs thathe built and just today when I wastalking to Tony in in the afternoon hetold me why the kalu's car shape is theway it is how the square shapes are theleast least secure shapes in the worldand how how it leads to a lot ofaccidents and fatalities in in theindustry and Tony is going to shareshare with us as to how is the how isthe building canoe into the NextGeneration platform a fantastic platformdesign I had the opportunity of spendinga lot of time with Tonyand and Tony is an innovator he hasinnovated many Industries in the pastAerospacecyber security and software and one ofthe common themes that he uses acrossall of these is you use this data andthe amount of data which the businessesgenerates to drive business and outcomesand transform Industries has donemulti-billion dollar exits he also alsoruns his ownAFP Ventures which is a capital Ventureand and lastly 20 I also want to sharewith you a small anecdote story is thatmany many of us as Leaders we talk aboutdoing good for society I'm going to itfor for society we can do it in threeways we can do it by doing financialhelpwe can do it by giving time or we canjoin initiatives and enable people to dogreat things Society Tony does all threeand one of the examples that I rememberTony from our conversations last timewas that uh in his in his Jackson HoleRanch is that he conducts inspirationalsessions for specially able children toachieve the dreams that they want tothat they want to do they want toachieve in life and it has to be in inmany ways and it kind of stayed with meso I welcome Tony on stage to share hisstory and to share as to what he's doingwith Kano please Tony welcome[Applause]thank youhi everyoneum my name is Tony I'm a typicalentrepreneur actually grew up not farfrom here in um San Pablo OaklandRichmond areaand started my first tech company downhereum I grew up in what they call theSilicon ghettoum over there on the other sideand umand it was pretty inspirational Placeactually which is where most ofmy tech ideas came from and like many ofyou which have invented Techyou're inspired by something in yourchildhoodand soI believe everybody should have a chanceI never went past the ninth gradeand that'sand that was actually one of the bestexperiences for me and it inspired me toto learn how to do things differentlyand so what I did is I started to thinkback to when I lived in the ghetto whatwas it like you knowthank youum soI basically tried to democratize andbring transparency to things that weregenerating fraud or bad behavior it'show I startedI have a passion for things that go fastand so I love Aviation and Automotiveand do you know this that the minute youbring Mobilityto a new environmentthe income of that household will go up25 times in one yearwhen we went into Africa and we helpedget mobility in there 25 timesbecause otherwise their ecosystem was sosmall it was captive and so they neverreally hadthe ability for capitalism sothis Mobility is really an inspiringspace and it's in intersecting todaywithumwith it oh by the way there's adisclaimer thing up here from thelawyersuh so just let those guys do their thingbut but uh my passion waslike think of the working people in theworld right if you grow up in the ghettoyou see people struggle you see peoplehungry you see people steal not becausethey steal but because sometimes theyhave to steal and so you have adifferent perspective but do you realizethe working peopleDrive the oldest carswhich have terrible gas mileage and havemore cost per mile and they're thepeople who workright like we don't sit at a deskthey're out there moving Earth they'redoing whatever they're doing and so likewhy does the EV world have to be forRich dudes that don't wear socksuh instead like what about the workingguyand so in order to do that you have todemocratize the vehicle because thevehicle is a whole bunch of stuff that'sbolted together that is never designedto come apartand in fact they want to keep sellingyou more of itwhen you only need to replace some of ithow many of you sold your car in thepast because you were tired of theinfotainment systemor you wanted better safety features allthat that should be upgradablenow to do that you can't be an oem youhave to become a Temwhich is a technology driven environmentbecause technology democratizes it getsrid of stuffand it makes it more cognitive so tomake it affordable we had to invent aplatform just like all of you in Tech doand that platform has to be able to takeany shape formon top of itnow we went with round because your eyesare roundand they're not Square your head'saroundso when you build something round itactually is going to use you better soso the person is mine so it's veryhuman-centric designbut the the purpose of this platform isso that you never have to go and getanother chassis you just get a new tophat like you get a new coatand that will create the first near NewMarket but for for third world countriesand other environments that aremobilizingthat makes it democratize for financingbecause you could put 20-year financingon that chassisand five years on the top hat the worldwill change and for the better now youcan't think like an oem because then youjust want to push steel and volume whatwe want to do is actually create thenear New Market and let every vehicle bemodifiable to youlike if you went out and saw the vehicleyou'd see that your body never movesmore than 30 percent why becauseanything beyond that is going to cause aworkman's comp or an injury or somethinglike that Ingress egress basic thingsso the multi-purpose platform now thebig passion was let somebody get achassis and have the what we call thempp1 and it can go from military gradeto Adventure grade to Fleet grade itjust doesn't matter it's just a top hattakes less than six hours to change itbecause it's the first vehicle thatdrives by wire Breaks by wire it'sharmonizing articulated it's built with1600 Parts not ten thousandhas very few partsand it resembles the spinal cord in itsdesign in the way the electrical systemworksthis happens to be called the AmericanBulldog this is for military silentwatchand uh the Bulldogs on the exact samechassis that you saw out there butnotice it's clearance it's also verycognitive in the sense that the sensorsso we wanted the sensors to beupgradable so you don't have to buy anew vehicle when you don't want to butyet you can still go in and get thelatest and greatest stuffthis is a very different way of thinkingabout it and this stuff will only getmore and more intelligent as time goeson in factyou know as we work with the Google teamwe ingest so much data becauseeverything is connected on the vehiclebecause it is signalsstriving by wireit's breaking by wire it's regen it'slike if you're if your butt came off theseat it would go into Parkum so it's super intelligent for safetyand for environmental reasonsso what we focused on was being able tomeet Fleet grade military grade and thenconsumer gradeuh fleets are the most abusive that'sthey they pump a lot of data so you needto have a cognitive platform that speaksto the userand that's where for usfinding a partner that could processwhat we can throw is the Monstrouscompared to a number in a normal vehicleso typical vehicle like today people arethinking of AI like I'm going to come intoday and I'm going to askwhat vehicles do I need to pay attentionto if I'm the manager of a fleet oryou know somebody who's managing amilitary uh deploymentinstead you know we're thinking moretowards the cognitive layer whereactually when you come init's already done most of those stepsfor you and then it tells you the stepsit can't dorather than what you should do so we'removing it to a very different space inthe cognitivity and of course you can'tdo that unless you can process data 80of all the repairs on this vehicle aredone over the air the only thing wechange is tires shocks that's about itand those chassis will run for a millionmilesum it's our own Battery Technology whichis all signaled to each single celluh this is the future of Mobility sowhether the vehicle takes a form of aconsumer's life or a fleet life or amilitary's lifethe platform is designed to adapt totheir environmentwe just throw Bunches of data it's acontrol tower we built the vehicles forNASA so the first eight miles of everylaunch is the most important eight milesas Charlie Blackwellwill sayand she runs launch and she's abrilliant individual and an amazingAmerican very inspiringbut we developed a vehicle that getsthose astronauts those eight milesbefore they get in because nothing cango wrongand working with them was a tremendousprivilege uh to be able to do thatand we learned so much about theergonomics of a body through NASA rightbecause when you think about what theygo throughand all of this they ingest a wholebunch of data they're they're just datahounds and we we really meshed invehicles we built for them are very coolbut here's a video and then we can justhave questions and other dialogue youguys want to talk about rather thanhearing me talk about this but here's avideo which just kind of gives you avisual of how you just do everythingdigitally you don't like facialrecognition no keys nothing yourdaughter drives the vehicle you canreduce the horsepower you know your sundrives it you can reduce it even moreso you know you could do like justanything right like today you hand thekeys you know your kid takes your SRTyou're like oh crap you know what'sgonna happen it's gonna be wrappedaround a tree this thing is so cognitiveit's such a beautiful thing and todemocratize ituh brings it to the masses and thatthat's our big passion and here's alittle video[Music]thank you[Music][Applause]so I would like to welcome on stage uhGarrett and and Ben from from GoogleCloud please give them a big brotherbigger Plusthank you[Applause]what do you want me to sit right hereokay anywhere okaysothe big round of introduction from umplease yes sir hey I'm Garrett I'm thegeneral manager and vice president ofGoogle data analyticshi everyone I'm Ben Royce I'm on the AIServices team building custom models forGoogle Cloud customersthank you and you've been on Tony now soto only have only one question for youin one word when can I have it this yearif you pay a lot of money maybe move itup a little bitumum any questions forget it as as tenuexpands these data driven strategiesit's amazing to see the subsystems whichis so flexible I love the idea that Ican tell my son to go only 20 miles anhour on the on this car how would yourecommend uh canoe and in the GeneralIndustry that they should be building adata driven architecture Enterprise whatare the best practices that you wouldadvise this plan a lot you know I thinka great example is actually off canoewhich is transparable to any industryand this is you gotta think about datadifferently you know the way Googlethinks about data I think is differentlyin the same mindset as kanudas if youunderstand you know data being you keysfor Teacher guests right which drivesall of your logic all of your cognitiveintelligence all of UI models youand this is the hard part right you dohave to get to a point where you caninterconnect all of your data right weheard the example about all of the datathe vehicle generates and having aplatform which can hold it the reasonwhy Google cloud looks the way it doesis because well Google you know whileback had a gigantic data processingchallenge right how can we index all theweb how can we have intelligent searchacross that how we can how can we servethat in milliseconds latency and thatcreated a new unique networking fabricunique infrastructure you have thismorning about tpus and all of that andunique software systems like bigqueryand data flow and many of the servicescanoes is using and the challenges thatI you know before before I hand it backto you the big challenge is that that isnot how organizations operate there is abig difference right in economicsdecentralization is great independentteams independent decisions independentexecution in a data Centric and AICentric world centralization is great soyou have two opposing forces inorganizations that kind of work againsteach other and the trick is how youreconcile them in a way so you cancentralize all your data and still haveIndependence in your business executionthank you Eric uh Ben uh when all thisdata is moving back and forth and we'reusing different llm models maybe in thefuture you will use vertex AI fororganic models and then partner modelshow do we secure the the data acrosswhen you start using AI From canoe'sperspective what's your what's yourwhat's the best practices that we shouldbe yeah they're working on the biggestconcern I've seen especially with therise of generative AI is the datasecurity aspect and it's it's because wekind of have been testing itum as a consumer model like you want tomake a haiku it's cool like it worksreally wellum it does unusually the image models doreally well with um watercolors for somereason it's really good at watercolorsthat's not really an Enterpriseapplication at least at scale rightum so when you have an Enterprise levelenvironment you can that data stays inyour gcp account it's the number onequestion I get at generative uh AIevents is you know is are you going touse my data no is it going to leaksomehow not unless you leak it you knowthat sort of thing so it's reallyimportant to take it seriously from anEnterprise a security perspective and Ithink that's actually a little bit of amistake that I think the wholegenerative AI Community made is we wentconsumer first wowed everyone and thenof course the Enterprise started playingwith consumer models and that's where wekind of ran into trouble so we built theum AI uh the generative ASF in vertexand gen app builder in the apis in thecloud environment so your data staysthere it's secure and what's kind ofcool one of the one of the first issuesthat we had which turned out not to bean issue was I had a customer tell me umby the way I'm getting different answersfrom this large language model than myco-worker is that's not good I needreliability and I was like look at theaccess controls you as the CTO haveaccess to every document pretty much inthe company if you want it this otherguy didn't have that access and ofcourse the answer should be differentright and I showed him that his answerwas worse and your answer was amazingright that's because you have access toall the answers that you should so itwasn't a bug it was a feature and youkind of designed it that way in theEnterprise world and especially becausethe news requirements is even morestringent because it was they cater toboth consumer side and on the defenseside as well right yeah and I rememberme and Tony talking about initiativeabout hardening all the all the securitystrategies and then things like thatum get it going back to you when we talkto Enterprises I see this business wantsto move very fast on a data drivenarchitecture IIT is stuck in its oldways and because of issues what are thebest practices that you're seeing toalign both of them so that a businesscan move forwarded the speed at whichthe founders would like to move rightthat's a big question I hope we have youknow two or three hours on this panelum you know look I think a lot of startswith the right cultural mindset you knowit sounds benign but actually it's apretty big deal you know many companiesI think still understand data as asecondary asset so they live in theprocess world and you know generatesdata and they give it into a system andyou know someone really smart looks atthis data then you know kind of improvesthe business and that's really a verydated way of looking and understandingvalue creationagain you know going back to Tony andthe canoe example right if you reallylook at it right it's it's technologyand data playing with each othergenerating the majority of the valueright and classical business processesand maybe traditionally conceive themare maybe things which are beingexecuted and detained of that butthey're not leading anymore right and Ithink at a understandingthat the technology platform the dataplatform is the primary piece and yourvalue generation everything stems offthat is the first step and I think thesecond step is really rethinking the wayhow business and technology interfacesright is it businessyou know split I think doesn't reallywork anymore right because technology isa part of all business functions AIpermeates it in every business functionas well so the view the superiororganization models are you know thoseembedded models right the technologyfunctions are a part of every businessand there is no no unhealthy division ofthe two like like wait thank you thankyou for that and and Tony um as we puthere manufacturing plants together andyou deploy this would you share with theaudiences too what is your manufacturingstrategy look like yeah soum ironicallyum so this vehicle is is round uh if yougo out and look at oursumin addition to that we I wanted toreally understand how did America winWorld War II when we didn't have thebest equipmentanybody know what was the number onething that helped us winit's the quanson hut because we couldpop a factory up in days weeksand how many all come from some placewhere there's Terrible Weather I knowyou guys experienced it for one year butuh it like a constant Hut is stillstanding because it's like the court ofan aircraft Wing So I was thinking tomyself you know everybody keeps talkingabout being like Ford or Porsche I wantto be like Henry and Ferdinandand so we we figured out how todemocratize the factory to build it invery small increments so your capexscales and we decided to build it inNative Americabecause these are people which actuallyunderstand the land right this is thewhole thing we got in with them so we'rebuilding it in Oklahomawe're bringing it to the Heartland anduh and their amazing Workforce and it'sgreat to be able to use this technologylike we we just opened a sophisticateduh battery manufacturing site uh inPryor Oklahoma in the Cherokee Nationnearum Tahlequahand with AI we can train those workersthey just put on the glasses because youcannot mess up when you're messing withthese this is near you knownuclear-grade stuff so and we were ableto train these people that have a ninthgrade education just like meand that's the power of making it superintelligent so I would just sayyou know more data the betterit was a it was a really good book anumber of years back called umthe Ecology of Commerce that reallychanged my view on a lot of this andit's about manufacturing andhow you can read you know the byproductof a product of your product should beyour next product it would help you havebetter margins on your second product itwas about manufacturing and things likethat this actually totally applies tothe data world too so if you have a ifyou have a process and for example in AIwe have outputs that data scientistslook at for five seconds and go coolgood bad and they toss it and they nevershow it to anyone and I've had a numberof Executives that have come to me likeyou know I'll ask them what percentageof your price is driven by whatever somebusiness process and they'll say uhabout 30 I'm like you should knowexactly what that number is your AImodels are already telling you every dayright that down to the you know tinypercentage like you know double digit uhdecimals and you can use that to informyour decision so you can use thebyproduct of your data to get you knowbetter decisions at the least if not amore impressive processes but to toBen's point on this that like thevehicle should underride itself so inother words today you go buy a usedvehicle you don't know you're gettingbut this vehicle because it's a tem notan oem design it underwrites itself ittells you the wear and tear on thevehicle so it prices itselflike you don't have to know these thingswhat you you have to do is make sure thedata is is your asset manager and andthat's how I see the the whole EQ ofdata not just the IQ of itfantastic so theum you know and one of the things whichwhich also uh Tony is very passionateabout and the way the design isum is that normal cars have about howmuch how many 10 15 000 Parts loadingyou want to talk about that yeah so oneof the things when you become a tem youstart with tech tech is like Vapor likeeverything is possible right so now youjust have to figure out how to make itand we have this positive violencebetween hardware and processing whenyou're in Tech right so it's either notfast enough it overheats it's you knownot available latelyum and so you know there's this positiveviolence that's occurring butis driving the elimination of stuffthink of your phone like how many thingsdoes it do you'd have a phone book you'dhave a freakingdial phone you'd have all these things aflashlight all that stuff it's all inone like that's the future of everythingfantastic and and and I remember that uhnormal cars are like 14 15 000 Parts youcouldn't call it sixteen hundred partslook at the impact on on Recycling andsustainability and carbon footprint eveneven that alliance with the all ourmission that that Google and governmentdrive together from a sustainability andthe recyclability everything on thevehicle is harvestable even the batterywe can Harvest 98 of itso like thinking through that it takesyoung very disruptive Minds we call themdo it different Minds uh to do itbecause we're defying the systemwhich means you know you get punched inthe face every day but uh but therecomes a day when it's like everybody'sideaand that's the day you just quietlyenjoyso get it as you as you look into thefuture in your role as the head ofGoogle's data and analytics what are theI know a lot of things got shared todaybut in Your Vision what is what do youthink are the upcoming Trends in dataanalytics that uh that film canincorporate into their strategy as theylook forward in this journey yeah ofcourse I mean generate API is a prettybig dealum insurprising ways you know not just towrite IQs and poems you know my wifewrote Christmas cards with it you knowlast Christmas very successfulum but there is actually more than youcan do with it right because well whatis the most data out there todayunstructured data rightall of the data was inaccessible becauseit is so hard to analyze unstructureddata wise images videos documents itdoesn't matter it's really difficult genAI is amazing at that think about youknow your company how much unspracteddata you have and what it can tell youabout your process your customer youremployees suppliers all of that will beimmediately accessible for the power ofgen Ai and I it's gonna change the waywhat we think of as our data platformsecond thing is amazing new featuresrecommendation queries text analysissentiment analysis all of that stuff iseasily accessible again through gen AImodels and vector embeddics or specificsub part of large language models whichcan do some really semantic Richmeaningful theories and virtually allaspects of what you have in your dataplatform today and the last are thechanges you know not only how we workwith data through generative file andgenerating code it also will drive youknow how we analyze data and how wethink about it and you know in a quiteprofound way right because the problemof us humans is you only find whatyou're looking for right so you knowit's impossible for us to escapeourselves the Gen AI models are reallygood at also reasoning and analyzingdata and helping us you know by showingus things which we are not looking forby reasoning for us on our data andagain I think it's going to unlock somany secrets that are buried in yourdata todaythe the power I don't think a lot ofpeople even understand how actually Imean the hype around 10 AI is large noquestion about thatum but I think that some of the ways wetalk about it don't make a lot of senseum in my opinion this is the theory thatKnowledge Management people have beentalking about for 30 years and I got therare moment where I got to show them uhthe Enterprise it's an AI basedEnterprise search from gen app builderuh in cloud and I got to show them livewhat all the Columbia researchuniversities and research librarieslooked like in one chat bot and they'velost their minds like they like I'venever seenacademics jump around so much becausethey're not a very Lively people atleast physicallyum you know but they lost their mindswhen they saw this they were they werewait I can ask you this and they reallytried to push it and I said yeah you'vegot a whole university that's you knowhundreds of years old all in this and Ishowed it to them they they it was likeI don't say one of them started cryingbut it was close because it's prettypowerful now we can ask unstra we canunstructured questions aboutunstructured data and get an answer inmilliseconds which is I don't think we'dbe able to say that for a long timethank you sorrylet me go back to you a lot of clicksum and and for the for the audience yourband question for you is that if ifsomebody wants to create a data drivenarchitecture how do they get startedwith Gen AI deployments in theEnterprise what would your advisorythedepends on your on your technical skilllevelum I definitely recommend playing aroundentry level is the generative AI Studiothat's really honestly you want togenerate an image you want to kind ofjust do some prompt engineering it'sliterally a point-and-click interface UIsuper easy to get startedum I've actually found I've fell in loverecently with our Kodi modelsum I functionally stopped coding acouple years ago and now I'm back thanksto thanks for this you know which iskind of niceum but yeah start with uh generative AIstudio uh and then there's gen appbuilder which is basically easily reallyeasily Deployable search engine orchatbot and then if you want to getreally into the weeds um vertex Ai andthe Palm models for example are uhavailable but the the biggest warning Iwould just say to people is have yourdata available somewhere the worst partof my job for example is I get to buildthe the rare kind of strange you knowuse cases for AI which is really fun butthe worst thing about my job is thatpeople say I want to do this this I gogreatum do you have the data and theydon't have a good answer or they've sortof not taken their the raw ingredientvery seriously you know it's like sayinglike I'm the best chef in the world andI havenothing in the in the cooler I havenothing in the kitchen I just have Patpots and pans it's like well this is notgonna we need the raw ingredient and Isay them take it seriously because it'sworth something and that is like if youhave the raw data you can load it in gcpand you can start building stuff reallyreally quickly which is we designed itthat way to make it up and runningreally quickum just to add to this I think that'ssomething really interesting again youknow in an AI world if your data is themost valuable and most differentiatedasset that you haveso definitely you want to stop that richand I've seen an interesting Trend whereum companies would take their data veryseriously especially in a where theystart modeling their own building theirown models they start thinking like aproduct manager for not just forinternal purposes they take the firstmodel they do and then they make itavailable to their competitors for maybefree or maybe a low price and then theyuse the newest model before you knowinternally so they always have astructural Advantage so they've got newrevenue streams because they took theirdata seriously they have new revenuestreams coming in and then they alwayshave a competitive advantage that thatwas like whoa from the businessperspective I was like that's super coolyou know and that was something only youcan do if you sort of take your dataseriously I think in the future weshould if we can have Goodwill onfinancial and SEC filings I think weshould have you know data strategy ordata completeness as a factor that goesto you know when it comes to publiclytraded companies and things like that inan SEC filing I think that's reasonableto this day it's amazing yeah I I thinkso because as a CEO when when we aredoing reportings at different levels Ican see how that that makes a bigdifference both when you're operating acompany as well as when you're makingAcquisitions sure yeah I mean likesometimes companies just get acquiredjust purely because of their data yeahall right it's got to work somethingas a final wrap-up appointment from myside is that uh when we were doing thisthis projects togetheruh with converts it's a complex programyou looked at how how complex the theplatform is and as Tony said there's noroom for error here in terms ofexecution and both the Eight Mileexample the first eight minutes or eightmight first take my example that Tonytalked about and so Onyx and GoogleCloud Consulting along with the productmanagement teams we work together tomake sure that the experience that thatwe were able to give Kano was one whichmet Tony's extreme high standards and Ialso want to thank my partners out herein in the audience we are clearbladehere also which worked with us from aniot edge we had hashicorp workingworking with us on a terraform thriftingsite and and a bunch of other otherpartners as well so I I thank everybodyfor this complex program so any of thosethank you all the panelistsand I was absolutely inspired by by whatTony said and I'm sure I invite all ofyou to go and see the actual vehicle itis there in our in our uh in our boothhere on about just two blocks down onthe right hand side thank you very muchthank you everyoneanything thank you[Music]"
