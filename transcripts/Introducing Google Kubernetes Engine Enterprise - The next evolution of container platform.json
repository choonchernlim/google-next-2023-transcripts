    "transcript": "[Music]all right welcome everyone we are superexcited today to talk about the latestInnovation from Google kubernetes enginethis will help ourcustomers increase velocity for multipledeveloper teams it will help securelyrun business critical workloads andlower total cost ownership today I'll bejoined by vul mapara he's a fellow andSr leader from Equifax anaban sen Guptahe's GK engineering and lisen GK productmanagement so kubernetes and containersare increasingly popular amongEnterprise customers to deploy theirbusiness criticalworkloads what we are finding fromGartner is that more than 90% ofEnterprise customers will will haveproduction applications running oncontainers by2027 C's vendors will be deploying theirsoftware on containers more than about60% 67% of them what this means is thatthe adoption of containers is increasingsignificantly right and we want to helpourcustomers on this journey to adoptcontainers and deploy them as widely astheywant so what kind of applications buscurricle applications are they runningwe see them running everything from thelatest AIML workloads we see themrunning a lot of their databasesstateful workload we seeing tons ofapplications that fundamentally ischanging their business uh models solet's talk about Ulta beauty Ulta beautytook their legacy e-commerce platformmodernized it so they can deliver thedigital store of the future they arefundamentally read looking at how theycan give a brand new experience to theircustomers on Google kubernetes engineeax they are using gke for their datafabric they ingest over 250 billion datapoints in process them and they'vegenerated over $2 billion in Revenue wewill be sharing a lot more about how GKis transforming Equifaxbusiness so what are we hearing from ourcustomers right as a container adoptiongrows they're seeing more and morecomplexity uh for scale what they reallywant is how do I simplify or reducecomplexityas the scale grows for containers numbertwo they're wanting to increase velocityfor their Dev team specifically how canI give my Dev teams on demandself-service access to containerenvironments while enforcing uniformguard rails always whether they'resecurity governance orcompliance next customers consistentlybring up challenges or concerns aroundsecurity related to containermanagement 67% of customers identifythat container security is one of thereasons why Innovation slows down or hasa significant impact on their businessmodel 35% of the time that's actuallybecause of the security tooling thatthey areusing the third Talent there is a bigchallenge trying to get the right talentto adop containers at scale and this isreally help this is really a bigfriction point for Enterprises globallyto deploy containers at scale across theboard so we are committed to helping ourcontainers adopt containers to theextent they want help them support everyteam everyworkload and deploy them anywherewithout added complexity orcost today I'm very excited to talkabout GK Enterprise the next evolutionof containers to help customers numberone increase velocity reduce risk andlower total cost of ownership so how arewe doing this right so the first one wethink we can increase velocity for ourde development teams by fundamentallychanging the Paradigm go from percluster management to per teammanagement help our teams completely onboard very quickly as well as get theright uh as well as get the right uhvisibility on the cost and performancenumber two use built-in security for bydefault secur by default Security in theentire container stack everything fromplatform clusters toworkloads number three how do we helpreduce uh the overall total Lo cost ofownership by delivering a fully managedcontainer platform from Google that runseverywhere right get away from get helpour teams focus more on building theapplications and delivering Innovationversus building and maintaining thetechnology stack that theyhavewe are delivering lots of newapplications uh lots of newcapabilities uh as part of GK Enterprisethe first one is how do we help treatmultiple clusters as a singleentity right what this means is that nowplatform admins can deploy default setof policies whether they are securitypolicies compliance policies governancepolicies uniformly this eliminates thesnowflake clusters it's a big pain pointthat we continue to hear from ourcustomers right number two I'm reallyexcited to talk about the new innovationwe're bringing with teams with teamswhat customers can do is you can createand give access to your individual teamsaccess to Fleet of clusters right thisway you they can now each team can focuson their container space with the rightguardrails that the admin has set upwe'll talk a lot more about how that'sgoing to transform what we looking atthird built in Security on by default wewant to make sure that every workloadevery environment that they deliver isalways secure to startwith next is to get visibility per teamand uh per Fleet at Cost level atperformance level at um securitycompliance concerns this allows ourcustomers to quickly get to the meantimeto resolution whether it's on theperformance side cost side or securityor governancesideso how do we make this simple how doesthis look in the real world right verysimple what we've done number one iswe've integrated all of GK capabilitiesright into GK console it's a singleclick away to start and test all the newcapabilities that we are talkingabout as soon as you dothat a new screen comes up do you wantwhich features do you want to deployacross the fleet of clusters that youhave you can take your security posturecapabilities deploy them across theentire fleet you can also deploy policycontroller for your governancecapabilities for your compliancecapabilities across the entire fieldFleet of clusters you can also enableservice mesh across the entire fleet ofclusters I shared this with our customerone of the customers earlier today andthey're like oh my God you can actuallydeploy a fleet a service Mission acrossthe entire fleet that's amazing we'vesimplified this significantly for ourcustomers including config delivery soyou get that consistency across theboard once you do that you getvisibility at a fleet level all yourgovernance violations that you might seeconcerns you might see all your umsecurity vition that you might see allthe compliance violations you might seeyou can see Fleet efficiency whatpercent is beingused once you do that now that you'vegot your Fleet managed how do I startbringing different teams into it this iswhat we are really excited about rightthis is the transformation we talkingabout per cluster to perteam what once you define a fleet youcan now Define a set of scope for yourteam and you can do that at a name Spacelevel or a set of name spaces you youcan do this once you do this you canstart deploying some really coolfeatures right the first one we arereally uh deploying out is a roll outupgrades you can now start rolling outupgrades by team for your clustersversus all the Clusters at the same timereally takes away the toil and reducesthe risk that your team might run intonumber two you can now Define policiesat A Team level so while you have apolicy at the full Fleet level you canthen say for this particular team I wantsome additional policies that I want toput in place whether they are governancepolicies security policies compliancepolicies and then you can actually startseeing violations against those thatmakes it a lot more easier for you totroubleshoot what's happening right andcost cost cost right like how do Iunderstand what's the utilization what'smy cost by team how do I get thatvisibility so that we are not surprisedand so you can start getting thatvisibility by team aswell once you do this one of the newcapabilities we are delivering here isthe application Level security orpostureright we've in the past we've deliveredplatform Lal security last year weunveiled GK posture for cluster securitythis is looking at the application Lsecurity for the container runtimefantastic new capability that's going tobe G8 built in always on bydefault and so if I take a step back andtake a look at all the capabilities weare delivering right we only talk aboutthe new stuff from a customerperspective what you're looking at isnow I can treat all my clusters as asingle entity with the fleet I cancreate team space so I can M manage byteams right number two you get fullsecurity and governance across Fleetacross teams or by cluster you can getservice mesh at a fleet level at acluster level you can get cost andperformance visibility at a fleet levelat a cluster level at A Team level youcan get full get Ops drivenconfiguration management so you canmanage your drift management eliminatedrift management as well across yourFleet Le across your teams and across acluster right this runs everywheremeaning that you can we start from gcpit extends into multicloud aw Azure aswell as extends onto onPrem right it's a fully unified consolemeaning one screen for all yourworkloads no matter where they are andwe are using the leading OSS componentsso that way you always have theoptionality that you're lookingfor so what are we hearing from from ourcustomers number one platform teams whoare using GK Enterprise today theyreported 45% increase in productivitythat's fantastic right number two peopleare spending less time waiting for theirinfrastructure to show up that'sincreasing their uh speed of deploymentby73% right velocity that's something thatcustomers really want especially withall the new innovation that's happeningwithAIML and people are getting much greatervisibility into their compliance andsecurity violations and resolution timehas decreased by91% so fantastic set of capabilities aspart of GK Enterprise we think this isthe next Evolution for where containersare headed and we are very happy that weare first to Market with this right withthat I'm going to ask people to come andtalk about his journey with GK[Applause]Enterpriseright sorry for my 101 mistake learningI used to be on the other side I happento be this side so here I am thank youall for coming out for the session soI'm vipp mapara I'm working with aquafaxdata fabric decision science uh as anSRE and leading platform engineeringteam today I'm here to share someinsight about our Equifax cloud and theGoogle Journey that we have takenon little about Equifax so Equifax is aglobal data analytics and technologycompany we play an essential role in theeconomy and help people live theirfinancial best how do we do that rightso we'll talk about a little bit moredetail but let's understand little moremechanics so we have pedabytes of datasitting in our aquax assets and also wehave 800 people million people that wetrack that data and their financial whatwe call all my paymentsglobally that said we have 700 datascientists working globally crunchingthat data and bringing an innovation andthe product that helps our customer weare Cloud native we invested 1.5 billionplus dollars to innovate our technologystack for our next generation ofgrowth let's understand a little bit howdo we do that and what's our expertise alot of time people know us as a creditreport or credit risk agency but we alittle more than that we play into a lotmore Industries across the board we playinto Financial Services we play intomortgage we play into AutomotiveCommunications health care insurance soyou name it so we are playing across allthese industries across the globe ourunique blend of data helps us to fuelthat Innovation into our products wehelp our customers our banks ourfinancial institutions to make smarterdecisions with our Innovative productand deliver outcome which helps peoplelive their financial best so that's whatwe do think about it when you apply fora job you apply for a mortgage loan youapply for an auto loan you areleveraging our systems all the wayaround also while I'm here it gives meimmense Pride that Equifax has beenrecipient of Google custom of the yearthree times in arow that's a commendable recogrecognition to pull off at the pace wehave done the Innovation and ourmulti-year investment from ourleadership $ 1.5 billion helps us toachieve this kind of scale to give you alittle more deeper Insight 1500 plusapplications has been rebuilt we haverebuilt over 50 plus databases acrossthe globe so that is a sheer volume ofinnovation that we have done in last fewyears and that's what got us to this sospeaking of that let me take you alittle more deeper into the EquifaxCloud journey and how we landed on theGK Enterprise as our natural fit sohopefully with this you get you'restaying with me and you're connectingwith me so I'll bring all thistogether as part of the Equifax CloudJourney one of the core Foundationplatform that was envisioned by ourleadership was name data fabric what isdata fabric data fabric is ourEnterprise data management platform thatbrings all our Equifax assets globallyinto a common format so wecan U remove our silos that we hadacross our data and we can fuel ourmulti dat solutions that we reallywanted to do all year long all from thebeginning as our Equifax version so thatstarted um a little bit um around 2018so we'll go a little deeper how we gotstarted but to understand the datafabric let's look by some numbers justthe share scale right as Nel pointed outearly we already to the point have taken250 billion data points and ingestedinto this data management platform todaywe have already enabled 2 billion plusrevenue of aquax across theglobe how did we do that let's talkabout the gke footprint which comes likebeing we have close to 250 plus clustersrunning we have across thousand plusclusters running across Equifax sothat's sheer volume which we built onthe cloud native transformation journeyand putting all that together inmulti-year was a phenomenal Journey thatgot us to this point this is just thebeginning let's talk a little bit moreunderstanding of a cloud native strategybefore and after picture what it wasbefore and how we are today hopefullythis helps you out on uh some of theaspects how we decided to make um GKEnterprise as our Conorstrategy so here are the few things thatuh we have taken the three importantaspects that really came down once wedecided as an architecture strategy tomove into Cloud native and all of ourcompon all of our applications andworkloads are going to be rebuil umusing containers well once you get intorebuilding all your applications intocontainers then you land up into a Cloudnative architecture and GK becomes yournatural choice but before we were intovirtualized Cloud we all of our securitystack was hardening virtualized serverspatching those and when it came to costpretty much it was all amortized andstandard traditional infrastructure inEquifax data center collocation that wasour footprint what did we do after isreally what we've been presenting is wechose to be Cloud native we wanted ourAdvanced analytic capab abilities tofuel our next Innovation and really putSecurity in front front like so thatit's not bolon but it's really from theoutset we have baked into oursdlc thatsaid let's go a little bit on each ofthe pillar the three pillars that arealways um important to fuel our growtheffective when I say effective whatreally we needed is that when we were onthe journey to build our data fabricplatform we really need it to beeffective it has to meet our businessoutcome the vision that our leadershiphas set on so to do that we really hadto invest in GK Enterprise as ourNatural Choice to enable the scale thatwe wanted as an Sr we wanted to buildrun and manage as effective as possibleas safe as possible and as efficient aspossible so that we can meet ourbusiness outcomes and we can focus onthat and the most critical piece isdoing at scale achieving the scale isthe harder part while we all understandthe three pillars but managing that atscale is really the hardone next pillarsafe if you have built something whichis effective but it's not safe it's notgoing to cut it so bu taking care ofsafe and building the security postureand understanding all the controlsaround it so we as Equifax uh we havealready open sort our Equifax controlframework which is built on industrystandard like Nest NCS benchmarks and ontop Equifax has its own regulatedcontrols that we have to we areobligated for so that framework we kindof has open sourced the policy but wetook those policies and codified andautomated as part of and it's bed intoour sdlc from the outset and wecontinuously monitor our uh securityposture 24/7 so we know what's happeningand when the new threats new one litiesH happen we are always ahead of the gameand we are trying to continuously patchand keep thingssafe secure byDesign while effective and safe isessential the second one or the thirdpillar is being efficient thatsaid since we have our business has veryhard time managing the revenue growingthe revenue and they always on the toeswe have to stretch every single dollarit's very business critical pillar thatwe need to do I still remember like whenmy business president talks to me hesays no matter what you do do not impactmy churching that's the revenue keepyour system up CFO would say if you havespend the money we owe the money you gotto save the money before it leaves theEquifax wall so that's the thing sorryGoogle but we got to protect our dollarsso we have to stretch it so that's thethird pillar which is important to beefficient in everything we do we monitorour workload usage patterns our totalcost of ownership how we cancontinuously move to a more efficientServices as they've been available andlook towardsthat that said that's a slice of ourGoogle Cloud journey of Equifax and Ihope you enjoyed the talk and got someinsights into our Progressive journeyand thank you and we'll ask n to be backon thestage thank you so much it's alwaysgreat to see some great insights andreal world examples of how the power ofsome of the Innovation we are bringingwith that you're not off the hook yet wehave some questions for you all right umhonor Lisa could you please join us upherethanks yep it's always such a greatpleasure to hear about a customer storystories like what weo is telling todayright so um actually I want to kick offthis QA session with a question of myown to you weo um so for those in theaudience who are early in theirkubernetes or gke adoption Journey canyou share a few points that uh you wishyou knew uh when you just getstarted um I think uh on the earlierwhen we decided the architecturestrategy as Equifax being containers soknowing the pitfall of the switches ofit and so that would be one I would sayunderstand your Cloud nativearchitecture study what your leadershave said the vision and once you dothat then try to align with the strategyso for us GK became the foundationalcompute once we decided container is ourCornerstone of the strategy the secondpart I would say is keeping up uh withobservability this thing grows fast youblink and it's like a kid they out inschool so uh I do think observability isthe next piece I would think uh reallyinvest early on it's very hard to solveat the later part continuously thinkabout that as your journey isprogressing and the third and the mostimportant part um is the governance andrisk processes while you can uh automatethe security posture and all that if theprocesses don't come along with itautomation only goes so far so I wouldsay that would be the third piece Iwould invest on to learn more pleasevisit our launch Partners uh veryexcited to share more details about itand there are lots of more sessions soplease do visit them once again thankyou so much for your time thank[Applause]you"
