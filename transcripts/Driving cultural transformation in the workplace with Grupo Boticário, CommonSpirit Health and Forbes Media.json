discussing the digitaltransformation in the workplacebefore we begin just some notes we willhave uh at the end the chance to getquestions so that you can really alsoask me the panelists any questions thatmight come up during the day and as wellthe session is recorded and can bereplaced digitally later in the nextcouple of daysso now let's jump into welcoming the myguests of today's session starting withtalida Franco from Grupo boticarioplease welcome the leader up on stagejust take a seatthe second guest we have is CarissaStevens from common Spirit Healthwelcome Kristen[Applause]and of course David uh Johnson Chiefdata officer from Forbes media welcomeon stage as well thanks[Applause]good so before we jump into the topicmaybe you can say a few words aboutwhere you're based where you're comingfrom also uh as an international companyalso maybe say where the company islocated or headquartered so that we knowa bit more about yourself and what youdo in your role before we jump into thetopic sure well thank you so muchMichael it's such an honor to be here soButch patio is a Brazilian Cosmeticscompany so we make perfume makeuplotions based in Brazil it's almost 50years oldand currently one of the the largestbeauty franchiser in the worldand the largest beauty company in Brazilso it's kind of what we do and then Irun two big teams which is our Tech Teamfor collaboration so that's where Googleworkspace comes in and also our cultureteam so two of my favorite Topics inthis session okay thanks a lot krissaI work for common Spirit Health which isa large Healthcare organization we'reone of the largest non-profit Healthcareorganizations in the country and we arebased out of Chicago I myself live inthe Denver Colorado area and my role asa senior product manager is really tohelp our end users adopt and utilizeGoogle workspace and other digitalproducts more effectivelythank you and David uh thanks Michaelum so I'm David Johnston I'm a chiefdata officer at Forge media been therefor a little over five years now I'mresponsible forum our insights team or the traditionalbi team uh data products team the datascience team and the data engineeringteam andum Forbes is a new york-basedorganization and I live in Brooklyn sothank yougood so agenda wise as I said we havethis short introduction done we willdiscuss now the cultural transformationtopic following them with the Q a andalso maybe share what's next so that youcan have some takeaways from today'ssessionnow let's move into the first questionand topic that we want to address todayso first we want to discuss really thelet's say the AHA moments that happen inorganization when you have digitaltransformation topics and projects goingaround so maybe we start with you deletethe first what can you share have youlearned when it comes to Aha moments indigital transformation projectstough question and I thought a lot aboutthis questionum trying to pin it back if there was anaha momentand what I think about transformation isthere usually isn't one there areseveral right and the the primary reasonis why why do you want to transform inthe first place what problem are youreally trying to solve with thetransformation that you're driving andso in our case it was fast growth soum company that tripled in size and inabout two or three years a change ofstrategy so we realized that we neededto stop Outsourcing all of our Tech andbuild things in-houseand that changes the way that peopleoperate right and then third was weredesigned the company to stop lookingat Brands segmented by brand and look ata customer journey and so when you havethese three three things to together youneed people to collaborate more rightyou need people to talk more you needpeople togather around a common objective and sothat was from a cultural perspective butthen tools Drive culture and so we saidokay well what tools can we put in placeto help drive this behavior that we wantand that's when our decision for goingto Google workspace andgcp and a lot of Google products that weuse came from so this drive to reallyuse tools as a way toum Foster this collaboration that weneeded because of these structuralchanges so it wasn't an aha moment Itried to think of a funny story to tellyou but I couldn't think of one so justit was more of a journey yeah but I likethe quote the tools Drive culture Ithink that's a that's a good importantstatement because it's one of thequestions we often have when we discussthese topics what impact are toolsreally having and if you say it'sdriving culture I think that's a goodgood point Chris what would you sharehere on this question yeah tag on theidea of tools driving culture so in 2019two large healthcare companies merged tocreate common Spirit help and when eachof those Legacy companies had activeMerchant Acquisitions department so bythe time they merged we were on multipleemailum multiple email tenants multiplemessaging systems no calendar interopit's impossible to get an organizationto see themselves as one organizationafter a merger when they can't even seeeach other's calendar can't email thesame tenant can't message so a big ahamoment is just getting everyone on oneplatform so when I'm trying to schedulea meeting I can see your calendar andactually schedule a meeting I don't haveto email back and forth we couldn't evenmessage because we were on differentmessaging tenants so that was a bigthing so to drive that culture of we arenow one organization we needed to be onone platform and we were able to do thatwith Googlefrom contract to getting 165 000 peopleup in eight months which was critical todrive that culture of of us as oneorganization so you built the the thethe basic fundament it say to to makethis a success or even to yeah to allowpeople to communicate with each othersimply said at a very basic level andthen you add on top of that thecollaboration that Julia mentioned um Imean that just takes you to the nextlevel right but at a very basic you haveto at least be on one tenant tocommunicate of course yeahDavid what can you say from your sideyeah um well there there wasn't just oneuh I would say it's a it's a proliferyof aha moments there the the couple ofthings that I would say are are relevantis that it's it's first important tounderstand all your stakeholders needsand goals and aspirations and challengesand to to not just recognize them but tomake them your own challenges as well tobring that onto your team so as part ofour okr metrics we're big into metricsand tracking we we bring our partnersgoals on and so we make their successpart of our success and vice versaum the other thing is is you know ourteam is responsible for thiscentralization of all the data in ourecosystem and so in order for us toempowerum our stakeholders we need to make thataccessible and coming up withum uh a diverse way of delivering thatdata is is really crucial so if we havepartners that want to use uh bidashboard we make that accessible but wehave a lot of partners that want toreally roll up their sleeves and andplay with the data and something likeGoogle Sheets has been super helpful forus in that regard with directconnectivity into our data warehousebigquery as well asyou know bringing those sheets in orbringing the Google Google Sheets intoGoogle Slidesit that's been super helpful for us tomaintain that accuracy of data thattrust in in the data and then the easyaccessibility into the mediums that theywant to play and interact with the dataoh great to hear yeahthen let's see what what else we have inmind soum when we look into the goals of thetransformationwhat role does technology play for youlet's start with you the leader here onthis questionI think um hopefully an important oneimportant one I think for us we canreally say it was criticalum in so much as we actually have uh ourculture team and a part of ourtechnology team under the same person soI manage both teams and so we don'tthink of those things as separate at allwe think of them one driving the otherand I think at the end of the day peoplewhen you're looking atcorporate functions people spend all oftheir day working in front of a computersending emails making making slidesmaking sheets and so the power thatthose tools that they use every day hason making their work better or not andhow that translates into culture I thinkis really is really powerful and reallyimpactful in so many ways and I think toyour point it's like you know what howdo you engage your stakeholders soyou're actually solving one of theirproblems instead of just saying oh I'mgoing from Tool a to Tool B what is thatgoing how is that going to make my lifebetter than it already is and that'sdifferent for everyone all right and soI think you know when you started Ithink the most bottom layer iscommunication you can't have culture ifyou don't have communication and thenthe second one is collaboration and nowwe're going to a third step and this isrecent for us where collaboration isgreat but now I need productivity righton top of that soum in terms of that Journey that thetools that you have create and Fosterthe behaviors that you want yeah yeahgreat that's a very important point forsure Chriswhen I think about culturaltransformation I think about threedifferent elements the mind the heartand the skill set and I think technologyis where that skill set comes in whetheryou're working on communicationcollaboration those are the technologytools that really help with that so forour cultural transformation again tryingto gettwo large organizations to seethemselves as one to buy into thatconcept of being one to collaborateeffectively to try to standardize whereit makes sense as a big initiative inhealthcare is to standardize to dothings according to best practice sobeing able to more easily communicatemore easily collaborate to sharepolicies and procedures or bestpractices in asynchronous way becausewe're across the country so multipletime zonesit's just important to have thattechnology you can't do that withouttechnology to your point you need to beable to communicate but you need to beable to collaborate and I think thatthat's what Google allowed us to do isget again that buy-in of oneorganization using the technology todrive that culture but you also needthat mindset and that comes incommunication I think leadership drivingthat mindset and then technology givesyou the the skills the tools to be ableto do that do you combine deficiencyproductivityyeah into one yeahDavid uh yeah so within culturaltransformation uh we're focused aroundyou know data and imparting that as acultural change elementum so as I mentioned here a lot of okrsand metrics are supporting that the notjust the the quantifiable uh but thequalitative so we're always serving sowe have this feedback loop to make surethat the tools that we're putting outthere are being used and utilized and agood example of this is before wesettled our current uh bi platform wehad gone through four separate biplatforms and we could have just pushedit through and said this is it this iswhat you're going to use but we had forlack of a less colorful way ofdescribing and systemic rejection fromour stakeholders there was some earlyadopters that were gung-ho about it butthere was a lot of issues along the waywith you know how to use the platformthe data it was providing andthe sheer size of our data so we had wehad iterated through that until we hadfound kind of a hybrid strategyum that I was talking about earlier thatreally worked for our stakeholders so Ithink it's you knownot just about dictating the strategyit's about working collectively withyour partners to really find out whatthey're actually going to use becauseyou can have the best data out there andbe able to provide the greatest insightsbut if they don't trust you and ifyou're not working with it with them andthey're not adopting and using it it'snever gonna like lead to impactfulchange and hopefully aligning with thebusiness objectivesso you really leverage that option tohave stakeholder buy-in and to get themalso they help you convince everybody tomake it happen yeah it's uh it's superimportant to getting success across theboard great yeahgood then let's move into uh businessvalue framework topic so it would begood to understand now to learn to learnif you have had a business valueframework and use and if you can sharesome decisions you have madeor learnings you would also had in thismaybe we started this time also with youDaviduh yeah so I would say that you know Ispoke a little bit about like thequalitative and quantitative uhengagement metrics there that reallyaligns around the business frameworkhereum and the goals that we have in placesoum it's it's key to what we have and asI mentioned earlier I think it's it'ssuper helpful if you can understand youryour customers goals and bring those inas goals on your own right so that wayyour team you know has this intimacywith the objective that they're tryingto solve it also really helps in inbeing able to come constructively withuh like consultative suggestions soespecially when you're when you'rereaching into generative AI andum and other data technologyadvancements that are outthat you can start to likeyou know understand the relevancy ofthese towards your customers goals andto bring those constructively to reallyamplify success makes sense huhLisathis is a good question we we conducteda sentiment survey before we moved on toGoogle workspace to try to understandtools that our users were using how theywere using them and then their comfortlevel with Google before we moved wealso did a lot of personainventory so we went through theorganization and looked at differentroles throughout the organization howdid they use the Technologies we wereusing at the time how often do they usethem in what way do they use them andthat drove a lot of the strategy aroundtraining at the implementation and it'ssomething that we refer to frequentlynow the sentiment survey that we do weconducted prior to implementation and wedo it quarterly nowthat really has driven a lot of ourstrategy around ongoing training so howwhat's the sentiment overall are peopleable to do their job with the new toolsthat we've implemented what's theircomfort level with them and then we alsoallow them to givejust comments so we're able to go backand look at those comments and say arewe seeing Trends here what education dowe need to do so we've set up differenttraining curriculum to try to addresssome of those questions and concerns wedo a Weekly Newsletter we founddifferent forums to share new featuresand functions that are coming but alsowhat are those common questions thatwe're getting into our help desk for ourteam what are those common areas ofconcern we were one of the first Googleclients to use announcement spaces inchat and so we set up one of those wherewe just show tips and tricks again whatare some common questions or issues thatare coming in or what's a new featureand then we link out to more data on itso we're trying to really push out whatare the new features that are coming outhow do we see them helping our staff andthen giving them resources to then gofrom whether it's a Google provided blogpost or tip sheets that we createinternallyso that's a lot of driven off of thatsurvey that we do really just trying tounderstand again is it just a lack ofawareness which in some cases it is oris it they're just not aware of the newfeatures right or is it something that'sinherent in Google that they just don'tknow is it common Trends you see peoplestruggling to adopt a different way ofthinking where Google is so searchfocused so trying to get people tochange especially in Gmail their way ofusing an email system and finding emailsso is it is it a matter of just changingthose behaviors and getting people toadopt or is it new features andfunctions that we think can help peoplewe just need to get it out to again alarge population how long did it take todo this surveythe survey we usually have it open for acouple weeks is that we were asking sowe do it quarterly we don't do it to thewhole organization we do it to arepresentative sample so we pullclinical and non-clinical people peoplein leadership non-leadership all acrossthe board so all different roles alldifferent divisions again who are acrossthe country so we pull people from alldifferent divisions it's one of thethings we watch closely to make surewe're getting good clinical andnon-clinical representation and from allof our different markets across thecountry and then we usually leave itopen for two to three weeks to getresponses and again we'll do thatquarterlyokayso later what would you say here is italso you did surveys to learn and findout more or did you had another practiceto do this sobreak it down I think there's oneelement I think of this strategy istransformation is hard and when you talkabout transformation all the time itwears people outum I mean now we're talking about AI butbefore it was digital transformationdigital transformation all the time andso I think the first part of thestrategy wasumgoing from a place of transformation toa place of evolution right so we're nottransforming we're evolving and the thebenefit with that is it's not a matterof a project right it's not a matter ofa one-time thing but you're alwaysevolving right and so it's a lot easierto continue tochange functionalities to change thingsthat you're doing because you have aspeech that's talking about continuousgrowth and not One-Shot painful Etc so Ithink that was the first partwhen wewhen we've evolutionwhat started out really as collaborationum eventually became successful so wehad uh surveys that we roll out similarto what she said about we do it twice ayear we also monitor Google and some ofthe other tools that we use their NPS sothat's a good way for us to kind of seewhat people like what they don't likeum but then after you do all that and ifyou're successful people collaborateright and so we had a moment last yearwhere our senior leadership said youwanted to implement tools because youwanted to drive collaboration Behaviorthe the research says you have that wewe think we have that everyone thinks wehave that so why do you need this toolnow what's nextand so that's when we actually went tothe next step of the evolution which webelieve is productivity so there's a bigpush for productivity now I thinkeveryone's talking about itum and what we found is we've startedthis implementation maybe about twoyears ago is there's so much Legacyright so you have these little what Icall them little Excel monsters whereyou have you know like 50s 60sspreadsheets tied together in whatshould really be kind of the softwaremacros and what should really bedevelopment and processes that are kindof sewn together but have never reallybeen thought out if the way that they'rebeing done is the most efficient waypossible right it's just people buildingon things um throughout the years andthat's especially true when you havehyper growth like we haveum and so now we're at a place wherewe've mapped all of these kinds ofcircumstances so we roll this out to theentire organization about 10 000 peoplein corporate and said what are yourlittle monsters that you have right if Iturn this off what will breakand we mapped all that and weran kind ofum a survey for each of themspecifically we had about 500 of 570 ofthese to see how much time and resourcespeople were using for each of them andthen what is the solution for that tomake people's life easier so a lot ofthe times and most of the times it's notgoing fromum you know Excel to Sheets it's goingfrom so much more you know being it'sactually develop Tech developmentum revisiting the whole processsometimes you don't even need thatprocess in the first place so it's not aum one-to-one solution right there's somany things that you could do with thatand we work really close with our datateam too because a lot of that solutionhas to do with better access to dataconnecting data Etcum and so with that we're actually ableto calculate metrifyhow much time we're saving and how muchvalue we're actually adding to thebusiness so if I have a process thatused to take me 50 hours a week and nowit takes me two that's added value andso that's currently the businessframework that we're using now havinggone through communication collaborationand now in productivity is actuallyusing tools as a way to mapinefficiencies and using tools tocorrect inefficiencies so by killing themonsters you also saved time and usethis as a measurements to prove tosuccess exactly okayyeah you summarize that wellperfect then let's move on to the to thenext topicso when we talk about let's say yeahchange uh process culture and businessimpactum any anecdotes or stories that thatyou can share here uh maybe we'll startwith you againoh so many more stories I thinkour transformation is hardum but I think at the end of the daysome of the stories that that I likemostum is kind of reading the feedback thatpeople give so you knowanonymously people writecraziest things and um there was oneparticular feedback that I read maybeabout six months ago that this personsaid I I feel like I'm an intern againyou changed the tools that I work withand I feel like I have to learn how todo my job all over again I'm likeexactly that's exactly what we want youto do you killed the monster of thisperson which caused a problem exactlyand soum and you know I didn't know who thatwas of courseum but you know this like threeparagraphs of writing about how this wasdifficult to this person and how theirlife became so hard after this andum last week actually we were at aconference for for something else andthis person who is nowon one of the one of the teams thatworks really closely with us in cultureshe came up to me and she's like I don'tknow if you read feedback but I wroteaboutthat I felt like I was an intern againand I just wanted to thank you for thatbecause today I do things so muchdifferently and an example that she gavewas I used to have you know files that Iwould say version 65 of the file andsend it back and then it wasn't updatedand then I had to update it again andnow everyone works collaborativelyeveryone works together I use less timeto do the things that I needed to do andso thank you for for everything I wasyou know I complained a lot but I Iunderstand now all that we're doing andso I think for me that wasso rewarding because you read all ofthis and you're like are we is does thiseven make sense what we're doing andthen when you kind of get that feedbackwhen you listen to that live that'sthat's my favorite story I think so farso the change was of course a questionmark or a challenge in the beginning butthen after adopting it getting used toit they saw or she saw the value thatit's then it's a good process rightexactly and I think change is painfulright I mean you go your child and youlearn to walk and you fall down all thetime and then you become a teenager andyou grow and I thinkum you you have to tell people that youhave to be honest that it's going to bepainful but it's going to be better atthe end and I think a lot of the timeswhen transformation doesn't work it'swhen you you you're not honest withpeople about that right and you try toyou know do all of these things to makeeverything best possible and yeah youhave to do that but there if you wannaif you want people to change then therehas to be rupture and rupture is painfuland so I think just having thatcommunication and that Honesty withpeopleum that it is an evolution Journeyum you know no matter what tool youimplement I think is really powerfulChris what's what aha moments or let'ssay stories did can you share here withthis in that sense you also had somesome tougher feedbacks and responsesthat made you think differently or thatstayed in your mind for a long timeuntil you found out who it was oh I meanthe list of fun feedback just goes onand on what one thing I have lovedthough is through these sentimentsurveys and the comments people put isthat evolution of we have to go back tothe legacies like you have to get rid ofGoogle why did we go to go back go backgo back now I'm seeing the evolution ofplease don't make us go back pleasedon't take this away right now thatthey've had that mind change now thattheir muscle memory has changed from theold way to the new way and that's thetricky part that you mentioned where youknow now I have to think about how to doit whereas before it was just wrote Ididn't have to think I could just do thedo my work and now I have to think aboutoh how do I do that how do I do that inthis system once they get past that andthe new muscle memory is there the newway now there's saying don't go backplease don't take this away one of thethings that we did was set up a centerof excellence and the idea was whenyou're making a transition like thisthere's some things that are a littlebit simpler kind of straight acrossfunctionality so it's okay I did it thisway here I did this right here it's easybut there are some workflows or complexteam structures that required a littlebit more hand-holding and so we set upthe center of excellence as a way to toreally give specialized attention tothose more complex processes andworkflows work more closely with them onokay here's how the tools can help youwe might need to do some development aswell it may not be straight across but Ithink the idea of culturaltransformation it's not can we replicatewhat you had if you can do that you'reeffective right we can effectively moveyou from here to here and you can stilldo your job but if we're doing it rightwe're actually making it better we'renot doing a one for one we're not justmatching up here's how you did andhere's how you're going if you're goingto transform you've got to find a betterway of doing it so I think finding toolsfinding ways to help people get Beyondthat's when you really are successful atredoing that muscle memory gettingpeople to adopt it and and now beggingyou please don't take this away like Ican't imagine going back to the old wayright I'm not at the begging yet but Ihopefully we'll getso how long was that time until youreached that moment that when the firstone says please can we keep this don'ttake it away should I admit that I meanwe've been on just over two years butwe've had those comments for probably ayear now but I'm seeing an uptick so ifyou're new in your transformation don'tlook it may not take you two years butyeah we're in about two and a half yearsand I'm again I've seen them before butI'm starting to see more which is greatDavidsoum the survey is an interesting pointthere I wanted to just kind of dovetailon some of thecustomers that you've had very lengthyor passionateumuh comments there those I actually I'llshare this with you guys like those arethe kind of customers that I gravitatetowards because those are customers thatwere very invested in the relationshipand that's why they're getting veryvocal with their commentary I'm morescared about the ones that don't sayanything when you make holistic changesand and to be honest there's times thatyou're going to have to make changesright you might you know leave a vendoror the pricing might dictate it orsomething else organizationally happensbut it's super important to listen tothose customers even though they're thekind of the toxicity of their commentsseems grading or offensive but if youcan listen to them and under and andgravitate to what they're coming whattheir concern is and be able to win themover then they'll become likeevangelists for youum and they'll help you to sell thetransformation that you ultimately needto makeum so don't don't discount them becausethey're they're super important theyoften their sentiment is reflected by alot of people who are just likekind of given up and or don't feel likethey're comfortable sharing theiropinion or whatnot so that's a superimportant thingum and as far as you know uh with withthe organizational changes that we'vemadeum I'm so proud that you know my wholeorganization are the ones who are likekind of leading the change and they'reout there winning over audiences and andhelping them to make the data change uhgoing forward soum yeah I think we're in a really greatplace right now but yeah don't losesight of those kind of those squeakyWheels you know go over there and oilthem andjust no help yeah maximize on thepassion right yeah all that's tellingyou is that they're passionate yeah andso if you can get that pointed in theright direction yeah absolutelyembrace the screamers for sureum soum another good point is now what whatadvice would you give other leadersmaybe we continue with you David uhat that kind of at that point of stagewhen they are starting into atransformationyeah I I would say the key thing is isdon't like don't dictate change to themright you wanna you wanna understandtheir goal and have themum feel comfortable that you understandtheir goals and pain points andum so make sure you're you're having anopen and candid and constructiveconversation with themum making you know make sure that youlike circulate your proposal with themand get their feedback there are goingto be times I'll be flat out honestwhere you have to push forward onsomething and they might be resistant tochange uh then you have to put yoursales hat on and and really work onleveraging thatum but um those are those are the kindof like what I would say is is theimportant thing is they bring them alongmake sure they're active stakeholders inthe transformation uh and then reallywork on showcasing the value that thiswill bring to themum like generative AI I think is a primeexample A lot of people get scared orthey don't understand and what it's andwe're going to move to this in a littlebit here which I'm super excited aboutbut you know people get scared or theydon't understand like how this can bringtransformation and that's that's like ahuge unlock for them as well as a lot ofother Ai and a lot of other technologysothanksI I think it goes without saying thatyou need top-down leadership that's kindof common one thing I see though inmultiple organizations I've worked withis even if you get top-down leadershipsometimes part way down it breaks downso we have excellent support from ourCEO CIO CTO they're all on board butsomewhere down in the organizationalstructure you find that squeaky wheelthat we haven't converted yet you findsomewhere where there's a roadblock so Ithink making sure you've got thatleadership structure that's pushing thewhy helping them understand why are wedoing this what's the advantage to youbut also giving a forum when you've gotleaders that are having a hard timeselling this to their staff giving themsomewhere else to go voice that don'tvoice that to your staff because it'sgoing to be that much harder for you toget them on board later but give themsomewhere like you were saying where canthey go to communicate and be heard andhave those concerns addressed becauseyou do need that leadership and it's notjust at the top although that'simperative but it's all the way downthrough the organization anyone that'sin a leadership role needs to be able toverbalize the concerns need to have themaddress and have that mind and heartshift so they can help get buy-in fromtheir folks because like we said changeis hard right no one just very fewpeople jump over and say yes pleasetotally disrupt the way I workum so I think again top down but wheredoes it break down and find thosepockets in the dressingI don't think I have that much that'snew to what they said but I thinktop-down leadership is importantum you can't really go anywhere withoutthatum I think also kind of bottom-upsupport so we created an ambassadorsprogramand actually we had several challengesfor people to go out try new things havespecific trainings be promoters reallywithin the organization and actually thefinal reward uh for these ambassadorsum was a trip here so they're actuallyin our audienceum and so that reallymade something that originally wasdifficult and laborious really excitingyou know I had people like I want to bean ambassador now you know this seemsthis seems cool so I think you youreally need it at the top but having itat the bottom really kind of createsthis excitement and this Buzz that canreally push you forward so I thinkthat's definitely something that we didand um just just building off of whatthey said to the last point is have areally clear why and also a really cleardefinition of success and soum you know whenthe decision ultimately to change overwas before I joined the company so therewas there was I wasn't part of that butwhen I joined the project I said youknow collaboration is great but what dowe mean with that what do we actuallywant people to be doing we wantproductivity what does that actuallymean we want to change how people workokay what are they doing now that theyshould be doing differently and I thinkyou need to have that kind of two orthree layer deep conversation withpeople or else it becomes a verysuperficial conversation about you ohyou know you're part of the tech teamand you want to change my tools becauseof XYZ and not some of the morestructural cultural things that youactually want and so I think that'sreally important and also having like Isaid earlier on I mean optimism withhonesty I think is really my go-to soyou need to be optimistic that it'sgoing to work that it's going to getbetter but you also need to be honestaboutum about what's going to happen aboutthe challenges with your team and andwith other teams too and I think thosetwo things are really important I guessmore for who's running thetransformationum to kind of keep going not loseoptimism but also understanding thatHonesty with your stakeholders andhonesty with everyone who's goingthrough this hard process is importantgood then let's move into a very specialtopic AI I think some people have heardabout AI in the last one and a half daysso let's think a bit ahead and yeah Iwould like to know what do you thinkabout Chennai how will it changeproductivity and maybe we we start withwith David here because you were part ofthe trusted tester program with Forbesyou had the chance to get access alreadyyeahwould be good to hear impacts outcomeshow did it change feedbacks and uh yeahall the negative sides if if they wearsome it's always good to get honestanswers and stories and learning nothere wasn't uh so let me just get thenegatives out of the way here first soyeah we've been we've we've beenfortunate to be able to play with withduet AI within workspace here for Ithink three two or three months hereumthe negative is is thatthat what it can bring you're like wellthey should why don't they have thisfeature in here and so that was uh thatthat would be the negative I think ifyou start to get an appetite for uh youknow just that the possibilities withgenerative AIthe the experience has been very fun forus uh the slides the imagesum that I can tell you personally likewhen you're going through and creatingslide decks and you're looking forimages and you got to go out there andscour Google looking for like the rightimage you know that that uh as much asmuch fun as it is it takes a lot of timeso to to quickly have uh the the uh theduet come back with like really goodimages for decks is is like greatum and um but there's there's a lot ofother great features in there as wellum we I'm going to go a little bit offpiece here but I'm gonna say that likeif you use bigquery to drive GoogleSheets and in turn like you can ingestthat into Google Slides you can start touse uh large language models I thinkthat was just announced at theconference here so you can connect allthe way down into that which it givesyou a great degree of flexibility uhwhich we have been working with for alittle while here but that's another uhan opportunity there but from thecontext of do it uh it's it's beensomething that the team has been superexcited about and Ium we're looking forward to to more withthat and it's been a huge labor saverfor us so that's good to hear thanks somuch this crazy what do you think howwill 10 AI change your organizationit's an interesting question when youtry to talk about Ai and Healthcare butI'm going to set that part aside becauseI think that's a loaded question but Iwill say from operations oradministrative perspective an analogywith Healthcare is any clinician willtell you they want to spend more timefocused on the patient than they do onthe computer and I would say the samething from an administrative oroperational perspective the less time Ihave to spend farming data creatingslides whatever is the more time I canspend on strategizing analyzing businesslooking for opportunities forimprovement so saving time doing what Iwould consider clerical stuff makingslides even just farming the data thepresentation yesterday about being ableto farm from all of our different filesand emails to get a summary of the datawe need like that's huge to me like Ihate wasting time tracking downinformation in 20 different places evenif we're doing it effectively it's stillin multiple different places so the lesstime I spend doing that the more time Ispend in the data in the informationlooking at ways to strategize looking atways to improve to your point aboutproductivity that's just going to helpany companywhat do you thinkI think everyone is really excited I umabout it we're excited too and I thething that kind of comes to mind when wethink about it is as much to your pointyou know how do we spend less time onthis shallow work I guess I'll call I'llcall it versus the Deep work where weactually get productivity where wecreate insights and so forth therewasn't an article in in Harvard BusinessReview I think last year that theaverage employee spends four hours justswitching between things right and youknow if you work 40 hour week like fourhours in a week that's a lot of timetime and so I think that AI has thepotential to really help decrease ThisTime by being able to connect everythingtogetherum because you know most of the time youhave to put inum you know create a presentationbecause you need to make a businessdecision and then you spend I don't knowhow much time and drive and then you goand you're online and you're searchingand you're communicating and and that'sreally like laboriousum so I think it really has thepotential to drive productivity but Iwill say I do have concernsum that aren't you know typical concernsbut more so about the how this impactspeople's behavior right because at theend of the day you want toolsto drive Behavior and the behavior thatyou're looking for is for people toactually critically think about thingsand not just do what happens when youmake it so much easier to just do rightyou you actually have an incentive tonot really critically think about theprocesses because it's so much fasternow right and so it's something that wetalk a lot aboutum on our team which is what do youautomate now to gain efficiency Nowversus what do you redesign as a processto get it later because it's a trade-offright some things make sense for you toautomate the process even if it's notthe most efficient possible versus otherthings that are more structural maybenot but I do have this concern with AIwhat how is it going to impact the waythat people critically think about theirwork Journeys are they simply going todo things faster or are they actuallygoing to do things different good thankyouyeah with that saidum we are closing it out today and Ihave to say thank you very much forjoining us todayand I'm sure it's a an easy thing ifsomebody has additional questions toreach out to you in the next couple ofminutes around here or throughout todayor tomorrow thanks again and enjoy therest of the show uh hear it throughoutnext thank youforeign"
