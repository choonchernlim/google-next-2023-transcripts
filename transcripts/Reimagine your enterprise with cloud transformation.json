srivastav I lead the GoogleBusiness unit at TCS and joining metoday are my two panelists please meetthe CIO of CNS wholesale grocers and DrRani harshan Rani he is the director andhead of the AI Center of Excellence atGoogle welcome General it's a pleasureto have you and I hope you will have alively discussion and we'll also giveyou a chance to ask questions of themso I'm going to begin with you sudakarmy first question to you is what werethe objectives of the transformationprogram at CNS Wholesale grocers whatwere your business imperativesthank you good afternoon everyoneum I wish there was one reason of coursewith anything that you do when you talkabout transformation there are multiplefactors that play a role into it therewere many things that we were looking atover the yearsbut what I would like to say is thatwhat accelerated the pace oftransformationis definitely we had a large customerwho decided to move on and do their ownself distribution that was a factor thatmade us think how do we look attransforming the whole landscape ofsystems and applications we haduh you know pandemic was another reasonwhich I think in the supply chaindisruption and there was also a lot ofother impacts because of we run around35 warehousesthe impact of Labor and operationalcosts that were involved so all thesefactors in combination I think made uslook at options and then we decided tolook at our foundationuh systems and our landscape too whichis something that a 100 year oldorganization you know which has grownorganically and inorganically there area number of uh systems that were piecedtogether so this was something we reallywanted to take care of before we embarkon a digital journey is to make sure ourfoundation is solid and I think yeah Ithink a lot of these combination offactors went into uh reasonfels ofcourse cost and you know is definitelyplace a roleyeah and that's that's the reason why westarted the journey yeah I'mand we relate to cost being a key driverwhen you look at a Wholesale grocerybusinessbut my next question is uh why did youdecide to go big on Google Cloudyeah so to be honestumWe Didn't Start by looking at GoogleCloud I think from the very beginning Ithink our strategy was we need to findthe right Cloud strategy notum we never thought about saying it wasGoogle or some other things we've spentover a year and a half working on theassessmentum and I think we engaged DCS as apartner to look at our footprint that wehad they looked at everything that wehad both in our data centers and um andeverywhere else and this the statisticsand the data drove us to a directionthat said we need to look at Cloud as asolution because there's a lot ofopportunity for us to look at how we runour applications and as we transformthem part of that was how do we alsomake sure that we put our effort andenergy into things that are valuable tous in terms of business uh enhancementbusiness growth and not work on thingslike Hardware software patching and lookat all those aspects so a combination ofall that so it's not a decision that youmake overnight there's a lot of thoughtthat went behind it why Google I thinkif you look at you know we're lookingfor something that had a secure Cloudinfrastructure and a large part of ourdecision making was driven by you knowdata and analytics you know we are alarge company that has a lot of data weknow the world is moving towardsdata-driven decision making so that wasone of a larger decision making and whywhich chose Google not everything is inGoogle we have a small portions where itis right to have in other otherco-location so we made we made sure thatthe right workloads went to Google and Ithink that's how the decision was madecertainly not something you makeovernightit's not working yeshealth is on the waysoum a big takeaway over here is that thedecisionto move to the cloud and the choice ofthe cloud is not overnight so investuh in assessment something that you didI think that was a very wide strategyandum every cloud you know has a specialtyso look into what your organizationalneeds are and then do the mapping uh sowith that I'll come over to you Dr Alimy question to you is if someone were tostart their Cloud Journey now whatadvice would you give them you know whatuh pitfalls can they avoid you know asthey uh begin their Journeyexcellent um so thank you nidi for thatquestion as to Docker mentioned there'sso many factors that you have to takeinto consideration to have a right fitfor what you're doing in the cloud whatyou're doing you know locally and whatuse cases are supported with whatworkloads so uh as the assessment thatTCS has done provides that lens thatperspective of differentiating thesecapabilities so that you're it's not aOne-Stop shop decision it is a fit forpurpose decision and so from theperspective of data analytics and theAIML uh transformation that is going onin the world uh we are confronted with asituation where in maybe six months agouh we had 30 60 90 Day plansand today uh we have to remove thosezeroswe need three six nine Day plans we needto accelerate fast why becauseour competition whoever you are whoeverour company is everybody hasa situation in which they can bedisrupted by a new player in this areaso the plans have to be strategic butyou need to act fast and fail fast andredirect and pivotso in order to do so you need a platformthat is flexible and scalable enough soyou can make mistakes you can correctthem redirect and pivot and I thinkthat's a key component of rightuh of your assessment and youracceptance of the assessmentI think we didlearn day one there were situationsoverseas learn through that exercise andfigure out the right strategy and how wewould put our workloads on Google yesand what I would add isthat today we all know that there is onething that everybody is looking forthat's generative AI it's supposedly theanswer to all the problemsthat everybody has or at least companieswe all know that's not the case there'sso much more generative AI is a smallpart of it butit's a key driver and if yourorganization does not have a generativeAI strategythen thatis potentially a risk factor to de-riskthat you need a strategy for generativeAI and see how you can accommodateworkloads that fit within the generativeAI use casewhether that's using uh conversationalagents whether combining structured andunstructured datafor conversational applications orEnterprise search building applicationsthat have the capability to understandmore about your data and not just onedata set but combine data sets frommultiple areas and provide insights at aterm of a dime and so you needdomain-specific models that you may useyour proprietary data within your ownsecure Google Cloud Enclave to tunemodels for you that Google has noinsight into TCS may help you do thatpotentially and then you have theability to take these models and createapplications or have them accessapplications that are essentially gearedtowards your competitive Advantage butusing generative AIactiveFairPointand what you said was that from 30 60 90days we've moved to 3 6 and 9 days and II think it's amazingum that the pace at which uh generativeAI[Music]I would say experimentation is going onbecause experimentation will in timelead to adoption and uh we we are allliving the world where you have a lot ofuse cases and we are looking uh to thepath of business case with the use caseso that's where we are so with thatcontext sudhakar I would like to ask youthat in your industry consumer productsretail and distributionthis industry is known for aum a plethora of competing productsB it's also known forsomewhat fickled customer loyaltyquestion to youhow are you harnessing the power of datamind for your customerI think all of us know the customerenjoy what timeactually I thinkpandemic came across I think the shiftswere more dramatic in naturethe Advent of technology I thinka new generation is looking at optionsbut they canleverage so as an organization I thinkwe have to keep Pace with those changesin the marketplace we are looking at youknow everything that's going on in theuniverse out there so I would like tobreak it down into my termsforeignhopefully you can hear me better nowso maybe I repeat that or no I won'tbore you with that againso I think what I was saying is I thinkuh we should look at just AI beinggenerative AI I know there's a lot ofBuzz around it but I think there's a lotthat we can do with just the analyticsand Data Insights that we can get withthe data we have and add on to that Icall the core AI or your PredictiveAnalytics a combination of that istypically where an organization of ourswould look to say how do we improve theexperience of a customer uh in terms ofgetting providing them with bettercustomer service levels looking at howwe can do Dynamic pricing that may helpthemmeet the uh you know ever-changingin the retail industry and I think ifyou add gender to AI that can helpactually making think about it apredictive AI will help you forecast andget the right product right and on timeand make sure it goes to the customer ontime now if you layer that on withgenerative AI it can make sure theproduct is desirable by the customermake the attributes and things that arevisible the image and so a combinationof those two I think is where the powerof analytics AI is so if you look at theamount of data that we have I think it'san Ever ongoing Journey for us I thinkwe I would say we have probably justtouched the tip of the surface evenbefore generative AI was thereand I think going forward I thinkgenerative AI will actually help in someof those cases where we have to write alot of code and SQL and it was verydifficult to explain the results and andusing the natural language capabilitiesI think it it puts the power in the useof uh you know if it's done right in theuse of business right they can thenleverage that to get a better outcomesgreatum so I'll I'll come back to you in abit and I'm going to ask you about whatkinds of use cases are you thinkingabout but before I do thatum my question to you Dr Ali is thatwhat are the future trends that you seearound Ai and I mean you are heading theCoe here at Google cloud and Google isknown for data and analytics and now aiso what would what are the trends thatpeople can take away excellent point sothe trends that we see currently uh aswe extrapolate into the future numberone is something Sudoku mentioned whichis essentially how do I derive insightsfrom data there's a lot of noise in dataone of the things that generative AI canbe used to do not just to uh to makeproducts desirable which I love theanalogy to personalize products toprovide context those are great that'spersonalization the other thing is toremove the noise from data so imagineyou have logs and uh you want to doanomaly detection or you have multiplesentiments from customers about productshow do you filter all of that noise andgain Insight from all that data sogenerative AI is not just aboutgenerating some image uh that's a that'snow a party gimmick everybody can dothat and of course we do it very well uhand it's important when used correctlylike for example on a marketing brochurecustomizing an image to a particularmarketing task reaching a particular setof demographics that's excellent butbeyond that we have gobs and gobs ofdata by the way gobs is a new word ifyou're not familiar with it's a verytechnical term it means a lot of bigunfiltered data and with generative AIyou can actually tap into not just thestructured data but combine that withunstructured data look into the data andderive the inside the signals from thatdata can be pulled out regenerative airso the data and analytics that sudokerwas mentioningexcellent point we will always need aSQL statement for example or a cipherquery something like that but we alsoneed to be able to filter the existingmass of data for key insights we can dothat with generative AI that allows usto do thatsecondso this is where data and analytics genAI helps there second in predictive AIwhich is our traditional AIum we can do a lot to even doclassification in these areas so thereare non-generative tasks that generativeAI can do meaning these models canactually perform traditionalclassification clustering regressionthey can do certain things like that aswellthe third category are extensions wejust announced extensions Thomas Koreanannounced it day one I know many of youheard of it so our partners like TCSum customers like sudoker can leveragethese extensions so that you can accessdata you can access your traditionalpredictive AI in ways that you hadn'tthought about before and create pluginsor extensions to this chain ofspecific tasks that you do in agenerative AI chain so those extensionsbecome time critical they becomeimportant for your business and in orderto derive business value from llms orother types of large models you cancreate extensions that tap into Data inreal time bring them back do reasoningon that data and then take the next stepso in terms of Trends I see an increasein the use of the full spectrum ofaccessing data whether it's promptengineering to gain insights from dataretrieval augmented generation activeretrieval augmented generationforward-looking augmented generationadapter tuning low rank adaptation fullsign tuning that's Spectrum can beleveraged via extensions and gaininginsightexcellent excellent so uh what I'd liketo understand from you sitaker is thatthis isuh what are your key prioritizationdrivers are you looking at customerexperience uh new products new servicesor cost efficiencies as you look at youknow your backlog of use cases andum uh you know what are the ones thatare bubbling up to the top because whatI'd like the audience to get from thisis that in the retail and cpg Industrywhat could the use cases look likebecause everybody's you know hunting andyou know they have their own list butyou know there's something to learn fromeach otheryeah so like you said we have a longlist and if I let business drive it theywant everything tomorrow uh which iscertainly we all know is sometimes notpossible you have to prioritize those soI'll just generally break it down intotwo sets right um so like you talkedabout predictive AI so we have a longlist of things that we want to do underthat category we we have already lookedatforecasting as being one of the meanswhere we can apply uh the PredictiveAnalytics and do a better job at itsupply chain optimization uh routeoptimization we have a fleet rightthings like that and then I think if youalso look at umvery simple things that we all think youknow it's it's a given is within our ownemployee productivity right there's alot of automation that we can do once weunderstand how the flow of data therepetitive steps people do and we can weautomate thosenow when it comes to generative Ai and Iknow it's a buzz and and I know that'swhere most people are focused onum I think we are looking this in inthis you know in the areas of how do weleverage like Enterprise search withinthe organization right how do we there'sa lot of plethora of information withinthe company right if you take just itfor instance we have a lot of uhcontracts that we have from variousvendors that are stored somewhere andyou know it's when the time is there wemiss out on critical aspects of the orwe don't look at the renewals and thesearch is very uh manual we have to goand look for it so one of the ways weare trying to see we can use genetic AISto go build like a chatbot or a frontend you the users can just for example Ican type in and say show me all thecontracts that are coming up for Renewalor show me anything that has uh thefollowing terms or the same liabilityClauses or something like I do all thecontracts have the same liabilityClauses so all those things that arevery manual in nature is so time takingnow can be a generative air can be usedfor that so we are using IIT as the testbed once we understand that we willlikely extend it to all our supplyagreements all other contracts outsidewe are also looking at right from aContent generation purpose right we haveour B2B portal our consumers customerscome in there so we're looking at how dowe leverage uh generator to make youknow the virtual chat bot uh a featurethat we don't have to go and search forinformation we can let our partners orour customersfind it when they come into chatbot theycan ask you what they what they need somost of the common tasks that they askfor is they want to fill out a creditmemo or look for an invoice they'relooking for a specific invoice with aspecific information uh it's all manualtasks now think about the world wherethe Enterprise structure is built insuch a way of course you need guardrails and they're able to ask thatquestion and the system provides themwith that you don't need humaninterventionall rightum so I think there are a number of usecases that I can keep going on with butum you know maybe we can come back to itI would like to know from Dr Ali whathe's seeing from other customersabsolutely yes you're right onum but what I like to kind of footnoteto what Sudoku was saying was that thechat Bots that we had six months ago inthe industryare very different from the chat Bots orvirtual agents that we have todaythey're very different both are calledchat Bots maybe maybe virtual agents theterm agents might be more appropriatebut they are completely different beforewe have to identify what the utterancewas map it to some intent then take someaction a lot of this process was arduousand manualbut with large language models under thecover a lot of this back-end process themapping of utterances to intense TheTaking of actions the translation of anutterance into something that canactually be answered and pulled outcompletely changes the game creatingthese flows these dialogues becomescompletely much easier than we were ableto do before so it really lowers thebarrier entry to the internalproductivity that you mentioned within acorporation uh second so yes definitelycustomer service uh external or internalwe see that as a top use case the otherone is basically the combination of uhEnterprise search which is search withinyour domain combining your structureddata and unstructured data togetherpulling all relevant information fromwherever it's at into a structure thatyou can make a decision on this is verycritical because in the past we hadlimited access to certain informationpoints thirdly code generation justdeveloper productivity today developersare not writing everything from scratchanymore because you get Tempo whicheverdevelopment environment you are you wehave coding as a code generation you canfine tune it with your capabilities sothose three are top of Mind of coursethere are generative tasks forpersonalization that I would say or thefourth one which are making thingsrelevant to your end customer on an asneeded basis so I'd say those are thetwo top fourandfirmskills should people invest inso something you know for our audienceto take away over hereskills what kind of kind of skillsrecommend looking so um I can listedsomeacross the spectrum of how you do forexample retrieval augmented generationhow do you create an extension so herehere's an example you ask a languagemodel where should I go for a picnictoday let's saythat depends on the weather right thelanguage model that was pre-trained itcan't know about the weather today itwas free trained even if you gave it theweather in that day you know six monthsago or one week ago it has no clue whatthe weather looks like so you have to goto a credible Source extract informationhand that off to the language model forit to say something you may have to addadditional com uh quantities of data toit from internal and external sources sohaving the ability to do retrievalaugmented generation and the ability towrite extensions in a chain those threeskills I think are criticalokayI'll add a fourth one sorry this is mythe big one I forgot which I alwaysemphasize creating domain specificmodels tuning the model not not fullfine tuning at Google we provide theability that yourselves TCS can tuneyour models for you our partners thatare very low costtuning of your models for very specificdomains and that way you don't have todo as much prompt engineering the modelsare ready and reactive to what you needfor those particular domains so that'sthe fourth one sorryyeah I just had a question for a promptengineering you mentioned at the end Ihear a lot that we need people with thatprompt engineering skillswhat is it all aboutexcellent so umprompt engineering is all about it'slike writing a software specificationright uh and writing it in a way that isunambiguousso that and so it's it's not an easyprocess uh gimmick prompts are easy towrite we all write them all day long butthoughtful careful prompts that actuallyaccomplish the desired result have a setof best practices you need to follow soto your point that's a skill that weneed to work onvery good so um we are going to open upfor questions very soon but before I dothat uhit's like a brand new look at thistransformation Journey yeah and you'vebeen on it for uh over a year now whatwas the biggest uh challengethat you have facedonly one right I don't know we can hearmore no I I would say I mean anytransformation journey and this is nodifferent I think the the biggestchallenge really I would say is thecultural resistance and changemanagementum so for any organization that is 100years you know Journeypeople like to be on stethoscope theydon't like change so as long as uh youknow you have the support uh from seniorleadership and they're all committedlike we hadum and you have change management thatcan address the concerns of peopleand especially makes your adoptionhappens right if you can bring in thelatest in technology but if you don'tmake sure uh the people who willactually the end users who use it if youdon't spend time and ensuring that theyadopt that technologyI I see there's no value addition thenright and then you are just adding atechnology to a stackum I think that for me is the biggestchallengeand Dr Ali when you look around industryadoption what are you hearing fromclients in terms of what their biggestchallengesin many cases we see that the beginningorientation the introduction hashappened they're onboarded now they needto take action so there there is I Isense a general ambivalence in companieswhere there's so many Avenues they canpursueyou know so many options they can pursuethat they're confronted with thesituation in which they're not actuallyable to move fast because there's somany options it's sort of like you go toa restaurant and it's uh you havemultiple buffets not not one buffetmultiple buffetsit's going to take a while for you tochoose which one and you're probablygoing to get very hungryso the idea iswe really need to have some of our ourpartners like TCS like they did for youprovide some kind of a perspective alens to focus all those differentinitiatives in these and companies sothat that Focus can drive executionfasterand fail fast iterate like you guys havedone and eventually come out and then ofcourse you can sequence the next set ofactivitiesvery good so um there were some veryvery interesting takeaways from thesession so the first one is as youembark on your Cloud transformationJourney take the time uh to do anassessment make the right choice as youselect the hyperscaler partner uh thesecond thing is that very important toengage businessand change management uh is somethingthat has to be recognized uh as animportant element of your journeyuh the third thing is changes comingFast and Furious from 30 60 to 90 Dayplans you need plants that run in weeksso uh prepare for the change you knowyou have to tighten your seat belt therethe fourth one is there is a backlog ofuse cases available uh word uh do thetesting the proof of Conceptsexperimentation build pragmatic usecases that will give you the businesscase for you know deploying it intoproductionandTalent the talent piece is critical soinvest on itand with that I'll encourage you to askquestions I'll ask you to come to thismic here and ask your question of ourpanelists herethis is not a shy audience I knowyou mentioned about having you know 35data warehouses and now you've moved toGoogle it's been a yeardid you are you successful in building aunified data platform orhow did you make your analytic platformbetterso if I heard you right how I willsummarize it how did you make youranalytic platform better rightyeah so I think um it's a journeyum I will tell you when we started offdata has been uh has a special place forme and the people who work with me knowI keep saying you know we need to dataspeaks to me right it tells us what'sgoing on in the organization where theproblems are so if you know how to lookat data and analyze you half yourproblems are solved rightso if you started the journey buildingwhat we call data Lakes right when youall remember the data lakes and soonthey became data swamps right so youneed to constantly work on them it's nota one-time effort uh data governance thesimple things I know you talk aboutgenerative AI we talk about predictivebut if you don't have the basic datathat is you know accurate and keptaccurate along the journeyum it's going to be very difficult toget outcomes that meet your goalshow did we make it better I think wemade a conscious decision that we willmove our data from a current datawarehouse into bigquery I think ourvision has always been look at thevertex Ai and all the other things thatGoogle is building around bigqueryleverage that not just for internalconsumption monetize it I don't meanselling data I meangenerating value generating insightsboth for internal customers which are abusiness as well as our externalPartners customers you know just thinkabout a world where if I can take allthe data I have and tell my customersyou change the category that you'rebuying or a price and simulate it andtell the margin you would makethey would never leave a business rightthat's where we want to get to thestickiness and help them provide thatkind of analysisvery good great uhokay all right we have another Braveperson here I I have a question onMaster data in our organization themaster data is scattered durable here soI have a question about Mass data nowthat's that's a big challenge in anyorganization to maintain and maintain itone place consistent being consistentabout itso what do we have in this generative AIto keep the mass data anything relevantto that because if we don't have itright the very fundamentals are notright right so you can't you can't doany next levelso what do we have for Mass data in thisgenerative way how do how do we meanlarge amounts of data Master datameaning the the master data guidelinesyeah problems hearing sorry so thequestion is what can we do about masterdata management essentially and how cangenerative AI help in master datamanagement uh I'll give you a shortanswer and then I'll pass it on to seehow you guys solve the problem uhpractically is better my theoreticalanswer would be that led resolution isone of the master data managementproblems so you can use uh you canleverage a combination of traditionaldata analytics predictive Ai andgenerative AI to do LED resolutionand I think entity resolution Solutionsare critical to master data managementbecause you have entities all over theplace which are very similar probablyidentical but slightly nuanced you wantto identify them and make sureyour master data is truly your masterdata so I would advise looking atplatforms such as ours which allow youto conduct entity resolution incombination with the applications thedata and the unstructured data you haveit's a rule but a lot goes back todiscipline on how you manage your datathe governance behind it I know there'sa tendency for us to look for technologyto solve everything but like youmentioned I think technology can help usovercome some of our hurdles that we hadin the past right we there's a largeamount of data that you need to look atuh I'm not sure we haven't usedgenerative AI yet on those kind ofapplications but I can generally talkaboutum you knowbasic analytics generating exceptionhandling for core foundational data andthat goes back to my what I was sayingbefore if your foundation is not solidit'll it'll show up in multiple areas asproblems right so I think if you areembarking on this journey I would saylook at your foundational data firstvery goodumany more questions yeah I see a coupleof friendscome in yeahlisten to you Dr Ali you mentioned aboutwe cannot hear you maybe we can turn itonquestion to you Dr Harryum you mentioned about using Janai genAI for non-gen AI use cases as wellbut there are cost considerations toowhen you kind of go that route so how doyou how do you really make a decisionthere how do you balance it so thequestion was we had mentioned that youcan do certain non-generative tasks ingenerative Ai and how do you balance thecosts of doing predictive AI usinggenerative AIum one one thing that I want to mentionand clarify is that I'm not necessarilyadvocating that we use generative AI foreverything obviously not we need thedata analytics we need the predictive Aiand generative AI as the icing on thecake really uh so our predictive AIwould be under the bell curve the 60 ofwhat we should be doing is predictive AIunder you know you have your30-something percent uh you know betweendata and analytics and generative AI sobut what you can do in many cases is forexample if you're fine-tuning models andyou would like to do classificationmedical diagnosis for example is oneexample of that you can create a verycheaply constructed meaning it doesn'tcost too much to generate that model orto tune that model Based on data thatyou have in your organization that wouldbe appropriate for your use cases and sothat kind of parameter efficient finetuning gives you the ability to do thata context mapping that classificationreally fast in ways in which because ifthe the predictive models are very goodat predicting things they have seenpretty much or are close to what they'veseen whereas generative models beinghighly probabilistic can do a little bitmore but if you train them theiraccuracy and their F1 score will go upso I would like to strike a balancebetween some of those tasks that arepurely generative and then explore someof those that pertain to some kind offine tuning of those tasks for moretraditional tasks like classificationbut I'm not implying to forgo the dataanalytics and predict but thank youexcellent points you made thank youforeignso I think we have another questionplease go ahead and yeah I can seemy question is to sudakar so suppose youhad a time machine and you can go backto when you started the transformationJourney with the acquired wisdom whichyou have now having traversed thejourney for some some yearswhat are a few things you would like tochangeyeah that's a tricky question to startwith I would not like to go back it wasvery tough to get the organizationaligned to where we are now but if weset that aside uh you know it's ajourney you learn a lot you always wishyou did it earlier as we went throughthe Journey there were things decisionsthat we made or probably not right whenwe look nowum so I think some of those thingsthat's where I think Dr Ali was saying Iknow some of you are saying we need toyou know try these things out try fastfail fast so you learn from it don'tspend a lot of time and money and thenfigure out it's wrong uh I think it'salways in hindsight it's easy to say Iwould have done things differently Ilook at it differently I would like tolearn through the Journey adopt as we goalong the sooner we adopt the sooner weunderstand where we're falling I am thefirst one to go and tell my executivecommittee that I made a mistake it's ablunder and you need to change course Ithink that ability to accept failure andmove ahead but it cannot be that youwait a couple of years later and thensay I made a mistake and certainly thenI think we will have few takers for itgreat so young lady yeah please come uphi I'm Lauren and my question is what doyou guys recommend you hear me what doyou recommend for partners who arebuilding out their Google Cloud practicewhat should how do you find your focuson what to bring to customers for Gen AIwhen they're kind of all over the placeright nowumyeah can I repeat the question yeah yesuh so see if I was correct whatcapabilities should we bring to themarket to help customers on theirJourney for generative AI because yousaid there's lots of confusion today didI get that correct yes okay thank youthank you so um I I'll start and thenyou can uh augment so I think thecritical thing is to start with usecases that are top of Mind high valuebusinesses what are the use cases thatyou would derive greatest business valuefrom would be ranked you know here's thetop five use casestop five business value uh capabilitiesand then derive experiments in thoseareas where you can have the necessaryskills that needy was talking aboutusing the requisite skills for those useidentifying acquiring unblockingyourself on those skills necessary forthose use cases and the tools necessaryto accelerate your path down that roadand then exercising the MVPs for thoseuse cases to fail fast that's that's theprogression that I would see uh is is asuccessful progressionthe only thing I would add to that is insome cases we actually partner with afew customers so we can get theirinsight as we go through that thatexercise of you know figuring outwhether these use cases meanhow much them and what value does it addto them you don't want them to be at theend of the cycle maybe somewhere in themiddle of the cycle you want to gettheir feedback early enough very earlyyesgreat point so with that we are going tobegin to wrap up our session over hereand first and foremost I want to thankmy panelists uhsudhakar and Dr Ali it was wonderfultalking to both of you uh some greattakeaways and I want to thank each oneof you for being such a wonderfulaudience great to have you here and Ihope you got value out of this sessionI'll encourage you to take the time toprovide us feedback and with that have agreat rest of your day thank youthank youforeign"
