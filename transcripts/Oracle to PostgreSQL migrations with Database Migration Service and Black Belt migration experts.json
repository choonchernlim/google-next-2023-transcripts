    "transcript": "foreign[Music]I hope you're all rested ate lunch so acouple of sessions and you're ready forthe highlight of the day which istalking about database migrations thetopic that everyone loves so my name isI'm the product manager for the databasemigration service with me I have Carriefrom Google CloudBlackwell team and Gareth from HSBCso I attended a few sessions andespecially in the databases Trek I seemany many Innovations right Cloud SQLEnterprise Plus you have MySQL postgresSQL server lodb with alodb AI you havespannel data boost all of those likegreat offerings that we have you need tobuild a bridge to get to those placesthis is exactly what we're doing whatwe're going to talk about is migrationso how you we're getting there and nowwe're helping you togetherso why customers are moving to the cloudwe're at Cloud next I think that most ofyou know why people are coming to thecloud but just like a general highlightand specifically in databases so firstno one wants to manage the database noone wants to manage infrastructure ittakes time it takes budget you're alwaysconcerned to wake you up in the middleof the night thinking about maintenanceand upgrades when you're moving to thecloud and especially in managed you knowdatabase offering you're getting greedof all of that you're getting the entirebudget that you used tospend on teams on your databases onservers and now this entire budget ormost of this budget is vacant you canyou know spend it on your business onyour new customer experience the secondis that only the cloud can offer likeglobally scalable performance availableservices so if you would try to build iton your own it would be very very hardin the cloud we offer databases forexample spanner is a good example thatare as available performance so this islike the two main motivations and if I'myou know digging a little bit deeperinto database migrations what we see isthe three types of Journeys to the cloudagain if you ever did a databasemigration this seems to be familiar thefirst one is the migrate Journey this isthe basic lift and shift so if acustomer that is MySQL postgres SQLserver and just want to move to the sameflavor in the cloud so I mean my SQLcustomer I move into Cloud support mySQL I mean pause Grace moving to Classicfor possess or hello DB for postgres SQLServer the same the expectation fromcustomers is one click right they don'tneed to worry about anything elsethey're not re-platforming they don'tneed to translate anything and theexpectation is that giving one click andI'm there I'm in Cloud SQLthe second type of Journey is themodernized journey this is the journeywhere it's much more complex but stillit's just a matter of translating yourSource language to destination languageI mean a proprietary Legacy Oracledatabase and I want to move to like opensource postgres lodb whatever in thecloud but I'm changing you know theengines this is more complex but I'm notgoing into the platforming right I don'twant to change my application relay allI want to do is just go from one engineto another engine again not an easy taskbut definitely doable and the third typeof Journey is the transform Journey thisis where you're moving to a cloud nativedatabase already mentioned this panel sothink about all the possibilities thatspanner can offer you with the globalavailable Global scalable scalableperformant and now basically you wouldwant to reply from your applicationbecause what you want to do you want tobasically take this amazingprobabilities of the database and justcreate new experiences and offering foryour customers so those are the threeJourneys today in the session we'regoing to focus on the modernized journeyso already mentioned a bit butmigrations are complex I know thatpersonally I don't like changes eventhinking about moving a house or movingan apartment from you know to Next Doormakes me anxious I know that like movingyour data from one place to anotherplace is extremely challengingespecially in the heterogeneous ormodernized Journey migrations arecomplex there are dependencies peoplealways think about migration databasemigration is like you know a DBA sittingin the dark and just like clicking threeclicks and that's itit's never the case there is always anetworking team application team CIO CFOto the total cost how much time did ittake you need to plan so especiallyintroduce migration there isorganizational complexity within becausethere is an organizational complexityit's time consuming we saw migrationsthat start and end in a mean migrationin the entire process not just like theclicks part the process of you knowadvocating for migration and then untilthe point that the database is on theother side we saw processes that ittakes a day we saw project it takesheels you need to get the Intelorganization on boardthe second thing that you need to movethe data in a reliable way no one wantsto lose data while they're migrating andthis is exactly one of the risks bycustomers are super anxious about itthey want to make sure that when theyare moving from one part from the sourceto the Target they're not losing anydata and the lifeline of the businessthe data stays as isso after you know I make you anxiousabout that Miser migrations I want toshow you how we address databasemigrationsin Google Cloud so we invest in likethree pillars the first is productthis is what I represent we areinvesting to build and I believe that weare building the best migration productin the market we want the migrationfirst of all to be simple intuitivestraightforward we don't want you to doanything that you're not you don't needto do right so we're trying to build andI believe that we are building the bestproduct in the market we do realizethough the difference will be theperfect product let's say that I'mbuilding the perfect product there isstill a room for expertise and this isexactly why Kerry is here you still needthe nudge and you need the team thatmade you know thousands of migrationswith multiple customers to give it theright nudge around how you plan themigration again this is not an easyprocess and this is exactly why theexpertise is in Kerry would address itlater on and the funding so we're givingthe right incentives to move to thecloud so those are the three pillars andas I was as I promised let's start withthe product so the product is databasemigration service we're a nativemigration tuning for databases we are aOne-Stop shop for your databasemigrations when I say One-Stop shopmeans that you starting your migrationin DMS and you're ending then in DMS ifyou ever used DMS you know that it'ssuper simple you have a lot of thingsthat you're not expecting from a serviceto have for example baked inconfiguration support lots of in-productdocumentations lots of validation so asa user of migrations in the pastthe one thing that was super frustratingfor me was that I started a migration orany kind of application I hit start andthen two days after it would fail orthere was some configuration I don'tknow that it would take 30 minutes forit to fail we allow to test everythingbefore we actually start the migrationso we're letting you know that you're inthe right path all the time we'reserverless that means that you're notyou're not responsible for the actualmigration you're responsible forconfiguring everything on the sourcecorrectly or the destination but we areserverless you're not maintaining anyservers you're not paying for anyservers and it auto scales with yourdata in addition for every use case thatyou're supporting we're supportingminimal downtown migration so like zerodisruption or close to zero disruptionuh to replication which again for mostcustomers this is like the number onepriority and with competitive and securewe are a Google product you would expectGoogle product to be compatible andsecure on our end is of course all thesecurity that you're familiar with butin addition we are allowing you tomigrate on top of private connectivitythe way that you want to migratesoI will talk about about the offering andwhat we support today and then we'lldive into heterogeneous migration or themodernize so MySQL postgres to Classicmy second postgres was the first usecase that we supported it's been a whileit's uh it's been out a while it's NGAavailable for all no additional costsback City the way that we're addressinghomogeneous migration is that the mostreliable way to migrate is using nativetechnology of the engine itself we don'tneed the Black Box we don't need anylike proprietarymechanism in order to move the data themost reliable way would be using thenative replication technology this iswhat we do MySQL with postgres it's apost minimal downtown migration and itutilizes native replication one metricthat I'm extremely proud of is that morethan 85 percent of the migration areunderway in less than an hour when I sayunderway it means that from the momentthat the customer is set or user set andit starts using DMS to the point of themigration is running more than 55 of thecases if they can take them less than anhour it means that there is no like longpre-configuration it's very clear whatyou need to do again you're extremelyproudand if you liked possible SQL migrationsto Cloud 6 for postgres you would lovepostgresql to ldb for postgres it'sbasically the same thing right ledb isyou know postgres highly performantpause us Enterprise class workloads andthe same way that you're doing that inpostgres to classical process you'redoing postgres to lodb for postgres wesee a huge demand for lldb and DMS meetsyou there and helps you do that againsuper easyum it's in GA as well by the release GIa couple of months ago and it doesutilize native application technologyand I'm extremely excited to see thatI'm excited to announce that we're nowGA for our Oracle to post recipientmigration the modernized journey itmeans that you can start doingmodernization and get out of like theOracle proprietary database and move tothe you know classic for postgres or toother postgres today so we'll againserverless and we help you to reduce thecost of this like Oracle licenses and inaddition the main thing that I want toannounce today is that we areintroducing code and schema conversionwithin the MS I mentioned One-Stop shopbut this is exactly what I mean you'renot using multiple tools you're notusing one tool to do coding schema onetool to do data migration and then youneed to you know think if it will worktogether everything is baked into DMS sowe have integrated coded schemaconversion into DMS we have a seamlesstransition between the conversion andthe data movement reality empowered bycompiler walks under the hood so compilebox is an amazing technology that doesconference relation is actually beingused in bigquery migrations as well it'spowered by duet AI I don't know if youheard about something that's called AI Ithink couple of sessions mentioned itbut in the boat in Thomas session in NDkeynote yesterday we are using duet AIwhy how are we using duetoi so we dounderstand that you can never have 100automatically conversion of your sourceand your code right every code has theout of the developer the automatic toolmight be hard for them to like tounderstand what's going on so when youwalk on DMS and when you update the codefor places that we weren't able toconvert DMS learns and you know andtakes llmmodels in order to understand placesthat they can extrapolate the code thatis in in other places which basicallymeans we're saving you a lot of timeinstead of doing that 3000 times you'redoing that once twice and that's it withflexible simple intuitive andpredictable but again this is just wordslet me show you a demoso before I'm going into the demo areminder again if you're a DMS unit isthere you are familiar with that but ifnot so we have resources in DMS we haveconnection profile that presents theconnection to the source and the targetwe havea private connectivity that representshow we are connected to the source ontop of private connectivity we have theconversion workspace again this is thenew thing that we that we added that isthe playground for everything related tocode and schema conversion this will Iwill focus today and we have a migrationjob that takes the connection profile aconversion workspace privateconnectivity getting all together allthose resources are reusable acrossmultiple migration jobs so you canconfigure it once and then just reuse itsuper simplenow let's hope that the demo will workokayI would start with creating a conversionworkspace so a conversion workspace onmy playground schema code conversion Iwill add couple of details to it andinstantly I will see all thepre-configuration that I need to do onmy Oracle source and my postgres againin product documentation you don't needto go to external documentationeverything is within the productafter I'm doing that the next stepobviously would be to Definethe connection to the source in thiscase I already have a connection profilethat I can use so I willI will click it and then the next stepwould be the DMS pulls the entire Sourceobjects from The Source not only tablesnot only like that objects we do pullviews stop procedures functionsconstraints indexes and we rely you toflexibility to choose where you want tostart the conversion with we heardcustomers saying I don't want everythingI just want to start let's say how do Iwant to analyze how you convert my stopprocedure and this is exactly where youdo that I'm going to choose here tablesfunctions views and so procedures I'mgoing to click next and DMS willautomatically convert all of thoseobjects and I would land into the verycool honestly a conversion workspaceeditor so let's click convert andcontinue and this is the main playgroundthe conversion workspace where I can seemy source and all conversion issueissues and statuses and in addition if Iwould click on the top and you can seethat I can see my postgres SQL classicalprocess SQL tree which is how DMSconverted my Oracle Source The Next Stepwould be to analyze my statuses so thereare three type of statuses on the sourceor the conversion statuses no issueseveryone are happythere are review recommended which meansthat there might be some Precision thatyou need to be aware of so it's kind ofa warning right you will see an examplea hill so there are like Precision thatyou need to take that you need tounderstand but it's not really aconversion issue and the third is actionrequired which means that DMS were isnot able to convert my uh the objectsand now I need to take care of it andnow let's take an example Cisco Eddoesn't exist DMS allows you via SQLeditor when he showed you the SQL of thesource and the secret of the data toactually edit it within DMS again nobodywould need to go to an IDE just withinthe product do everything I'm going toadd an extension change it and voilawhen I save SQLthe object status change to modifyokay the next step after that would beokay I'm fine with this schema I want toadd another schema right I saidflexibility I'm going to edit anadditional schema and now I wouldconvert again and DMS will takeinto consideration both of the schemasright so we're taking into accounteverything that's on the source and youaddedand now after I'm doing the converter Isee that everything looks okay I'mmoving to do clouds of possible C I seethat this is how the postgres tree wouldlook like and now the next step would beto apply to destination apply meanstaking the converted schema and theconverted code and create them on thedestination as always in DMS you can dotests before that so you can test andsee if the code is executable but inthis case it's a demo let's be wild andgo straight to apply we will choose aconnection profile to the destination wewill check that we have connectivity tothe destination and we can reach it andagain another level of flexibility wedon'twe don't obligate you to chooseeverything you can choose specificobjects you want to start with applyright there are cases that you wouldlike to work in iterations so choosingobjects applying themthat's it now I'm ready to run amigration it's that easy see createmigration job within DMS start definingthe migration jobuh you know Name ID prerequisites if youever did it you are familiar with thatDefine the source connection profiledestination connection profile and thenext step would be to configure whichobjects I want to migrate again I mighttoo I might apply the entire Source butI want to start with specific object Iwant to start with only like two tablesand then add another more tables againflexibility is a key for DMS I'mchoosing the objects Next Step would beto run the final test for the migrationto see that everything is working andthat's it the migration is now ready torun and everyone are happy so tosummarize this is our investment inproduct right and as I was sayingproduct is not enough unfortunately Iwish I could be the product especiallyfor migration but that's why we have youknow stars like Harry that can help youwith expertise part okayokayhold my water for me okay that's whatI'm here forum yes this car saidum they'reheterogeneous migrations are notstraightforward a lot of times rightparticularly if we have a largelandscape databases andum we're trying to move a complex set ofcode that's been written maybe over thelast 20 years right and we're trying togo from one platform to another whichmeans the dialect that we speak eventhough it's SQL which is relativelysimilar across database platformsthere's still all kinds of nuances andunique things about every databasesoour team there's this team called thedatabase black belt team I didn't comeup with the name but the idea is thatyou know we have a very specialized teamthat spent you know almost theircomplete careers we still have a littlelife left in us but you know very longtime working in the database space andso we've been through lots of bigmigrations lots of uh Performance Tuningkind of exercises Etc so very deepexpertise in the database but thecombination of a set of people that havethat kind of expertisecombined with the tool that allows us todo all the stuff that you know was justdescribed means that we can go to alarge company with a lot of databasesand we can build something that lookslike I hate to say the word but amigration Factory right how are we goingto come up with a repeatable processthat applies to your specific way thatyou've used your database whether that'syou know an Oracle database or a SQLServer database but basically a legacyrelational database so anyway that's thethe team and what we do and it is to tryto give customers a white gloveexperience right we're not a billablegroup we're not part of the PSO orProfessional Services organization we'rebasically a part of the engineering teamthat's designed to work to do two thingsone to work closely with Enterprise andinteresting customers that have hardproblems to solve and the second thingis to work directly with engineering tohelp bring back the lessons learnedthrough those those projects to improvethe tooling and compilerworks is a goodexample we've spent a lot of time overthe last yearas we've gone through a couple ofprojects making that product better andbetter and better and so we're now tothe point where we're very confidentthat we can do you know very high levelconversionautomatically right so we're not talkingabout 50 or 70 percent or even 80percent we're talking you know in theupperpercentages right now that doesn't meanthat if we say we have a 90 conversionrate that we've eliminated 90 of thework because as you can imagine theparts that we're not convertingautomatically are the hardest parts sothat that 10 percent may take 20 percentof the effort right but in general it'sgoing to be a huge reduction in theamount of effort that we have to do todo one of those conversionssoum just real briefly you guys are allfamiliar with what it takes to movethere's two main pieces this is kind ofa schematic diagram there's two mainpieces that I want you guys to knowabout one is how do I get started sothere's an assessment tool calleddatabase migration assessment that'ssomething that our team has built overthe last year and a half and that knowsabout our conversion codeso and this may be surprising but thistool will actually estimate an hourlyestimate of how much time it's going totake to convert let's say an Oracledatabase to postgresincluding all the code conversion andsince we know about compiler works andwhat it's capable of you know we caneliminate immediately all the effortthat goes into the the parts that areautomatically converted and uh you knowwe're anxious to have as many people ascan private assessment and then try aproject with us to see you know howaccurate those estimates are and improvethose estimates over time but that's onepiece of it second piece isI wanted to mention and you guys knowthis all already the code conversion isFar and Away the long pole in the tentright if we're taking again a 20-yearLegacy database application on SQLserver and converting that to postgresthat code conversion is really thehardest part right and so that's wherewe tend to spend a lot of time and wherewe tend to get bogged down so again thiscode conversion is super important towhat we're doing and so our team part ofwhat we do is we you know help peoplerun through that automatic codeconversion but we also will sit down andgo okay this thing is not convertedlet's say it's a you know something hardlike bulk collect on Oracle that's avery difficult thing to translateautomatically so we can take a shot atit it may not be perfect for an instanceof that and we can sit down and say thisis how we would reproduce that inpostgres and give that Max an example tothe customer to say you know the thingsthat we've got to do that you know can'tbe done automatically this is thepattern that you would follow to do thatand then the AI thing that Chicagoyou know mentioned and showed you thisinterface that we have now also allowsone of our guys to sit down and actuallymap that out and say this is how I wouldrewrite this thing that's not covered inour deterministic AST based conversionand let the AI tool attempt to findevery other instance that matches thatpattern and then apply that single shotor you know double shot kind of learningto those things right we still are goingto have to go through those and makesure that those you know are completelyaccurate but again it's a you knowreduction by 80 90 percent of the effortto do that instead of having a manuallygo to 500 of these bulk collects andmanually rewrite it does that all makesenseany questions about that before we goany furtherum I've already talked about themigration tool so I'll just skip overthis but imagine a fleet-wide assessmenttool that will let you look at a severalhundred or thousands of databases andthen report on those and stack them upso that you can see uhsee it from different angles but one ofthe main ways of doing this is to try toplan waves of migrations so let's sayyou're like a Deutsche Bank that has 10000 databases that they want to migrateyou know that's not going to happenovernight right we're going to pick someset of them hopefully it's uh somethingthat's on the easier end of the scaleand attack those first then you get theyou know the Kinks out of the processwhile we're building this repeatableprocess and we're going to go on to thenext one right or for Pilots right ifwe're going to try to do not just theeasy ones but maybe pick a medium onepick an easy one pick a really hard oneand go through that process as part of apilot so the tool can do that for usum and the last thing I'm going to do isjust hand wave a little bit and set upfor Gareth he's going to talk about anactual project that we did with HSBC soearlier this year we started a projectthat was you know very similar to whatI've described already but uh to build amigration Factory is what we're lookingto dofor up to 6 000 databases that we wantedto move and the ideas we're going topick three or four or five databasesthis project was a combination projectwith our Professional Services team andthe black belt team so we're providingexpertise to help get over the hump butthe Professional Services team is theguys that are there to really build themigration Factory and turn that over toHSBC of course the HSBC applicationteams are you know very heavily involvedin this process and so is theengineering team on the DMS side thiswas actually done while we were inprivate preview it wasn't even a a gaproduct at the time we started itso again right team right knowledgeright tools you know basically thatcombination is is what we're trying toprovide all right and with that I'llturn it over to Gareth and let him talkabout you know the really important partwhich is how did this thing play outwith uh with a real customerthanks thank youyeah soI think my angle on this is I like theword migration Factory by the way Ithink it's a good idea it's a goodconcept I think my angle on this and puta preamp put a preamble first of allso HSBC very complicated Globalorganization from the very largeshipping of transaction of trade aroundaround the world number one trade Bankwe can see there are 800 billion dollarsworth of transactionson an annual basis requires an awful lotof processing behind the scenes requiresthose six thousand Oracle databases Garymentioned behind the scenes a lot ofcomplexity everywhere so we have thelargest of the largest of scale theyhave the smallest of the smallest thebottom leftis a mobile app built natively on Googleusing only native database and containthe technologyso we like to have the worst and theworst we'd like to have the best and thebest but ultimately we need to shiftfrom one to the other and as Shaka saidas Kerry said we need a repeatabletrustworthy processthis is part of a wider Journey thatthat we're on as an organization a lotof this is very familiar to youhow do we get products to Market quickerfor our customers which is probably someof you in the room you know our Globalfootprint of retail commercial productstrade products digital banking appseverywhere how do we get products toMarket quickerwe know we cannot do that on our ownwe'd be foolish enough you know we'vewe're entrusted with your money not withyour technology that's what we trustthese guys for and some of you in theroom you know we trust Google for theirtechnology hopefullythree of you trust those with your moneythat's that's the partnership we'retrying to move to herein order to do that it's got to beresilient it's got to be secure it's gotto be as frictionless as possibleand again it's got to be it's going tohave that scale to I can't emphasizeenough the scale problems we have as aglobal organizationso the partnership with Google startedfive years agoumright on the cusp of when Google weretrying to sort of I think break into theEnterprise customer and consumer Marketnobody's ever going to question thescale the the volume of the Google appsthe the one you know the nine apps thatserve over one billion customers eachwe're not going to compete with thatbut what Google had to learn veryquickly is how do you work with anEnterprise Financial Services client howdo you work with an EnterpriseAutomotive client how do you work withan Enterprise energies clientthat operates in 50 60 80 100 countrieswith regulated markets you know we have400 Regulators we have to satisfy on anannual basis who want to know wheretheir customers money is at any one timeso the partnership with Google was aboutbuilding their products set enhancing itto meet the rigor of a financialservices organization but enabling us togrow our digital footprint enabling usto expand into technologythat we couldn't have done on our own wecouldn't have released new products toMarket we couldn't have gotten moresecure we couldn't have scaled withoutthis partnership with Googleso I usually only have one slide forthis presentation and this is the oneslideon that partnership on that scaleconstant Tech evolutionthe one problem I have is standing stillstanding still as a large company withthousands of databasesthousands of applications is standingstill cost me money it cost me a lot ofmoneyjust keeping the lights on costs ourorganization an awful lot of money yeahI I won't go into the details butjust keeping an application currentkeeping it free from vulnerabilities wetalked about log4j this morningI wish it took any I wish it took usonly a week to tackle log for Jay yeahwe're still tackling the remnants of itnow because we couldn't discovereverything was we couldn't get to everyserver out there we couldn't get toevery database service out there just tolook at our exposurebecause we don't have the tools we don'thave the technology and we're fightingyears and years of legacyagain really resonating to the to thismorning's keynote we are fighting withYears of Legacybut I'll repeat what we said thismorning Legacy is goodLegacy is where your money is stored soLegacy has to be very goodbut the challenge still is it cost usmoney to stand still we need toaccelerate our technology migrationwe can build new stuff on cloud to meetnew regulations to meet new mobilepropositions toto get the new funky things out therebut what about the rest of ourtechnologyI think that's what started our journeyto a factoryit's not a it's not a an old conceptsorry it's not a New Concept it's beenaround for a long time you know the there-host free platform re-architectbut for us the factory is making it acompelling reason for our applicationteams our application owners to move toa new technologywell it costs them an awful lot of moneyto stand still it costs them even moremoney to do something to change theirapplication it costs them more money andit costs them downtime to change theirapplication they haven't got that sowe've got to give them a compellingreason to moveand that's what and that's why we cameup with the idea for the migrationFactorythe challenge is that graph on the onthe top right of the screenyou can see a couple of lines thatdisappear off into the sunset that's thethe top one really is the line of donothing and your cost base increasesyear on year if you do not touch thatthat Oracle database that sci basedatabase a db2 database and it grows andyou have to keep it running you have tokeep it patch free you have to upgradethe infrastructure underneath you haveto keep it current to latest versionsthat line just keeps going up and up andupyou've not done anything to improve thefunctionality and feature of that youjust kept the lights onand then you can see the bit of redshading at the bottom of that of thattablethat's the size of the opportunity thatwe're trying to grab hold of from adollar perspective and the longer thisgoes out the opportunity gets greaterbut the cost gets even further away fromusso what we're trying to do is come upwith a way to stop that line growing andgrowing and growing and to realize theopportunity of transforming andmodernizing our servicesI think that's what really kicked offthe need to say to Google guys we're allin with you but we need a way to getfrom A to B we need a repeatable processwe need a hands-off keys processwe need a process we can audit a processwe can log a process we can scaleand that's what started the journey withthe database migration service we have aclear intentto movesome if not all of those six thousandOracle databases and modernize ourinfrastructure entirelybut we know this is only the start ofthe journeythe Oracle to postgres will only be thevery start of the journey for uswe're very excited to to work to workwith these guys on Oracle to alloyhopefully alloy only as well because weknow the scale that we have aroundOracle and those global instances canonly be met by some of the the morescalable robust services from Googleso all of that all of this one slidereally encapsulates our modernizationjourney and the opportunity that if wedon't take we miss the costs keep goingaway the estate keeps getting biggerI'll think on thatno it really is the you know I reallydon't mind doing the cell here on yourguys behalf is the partnership we'vechosen you know a few of my engineeringteam in in Hong Kong and Londonteam they just got together and workedas a virtual team yeah those are theproblem statements here's our complexityhere's a way of tackling through with itwith the expertise here are the productsavailable to youI think without that I think we wouldn'thave got where we are today we certainlywouldn't have got the opportunity now tostart moving those databasesI think that all comes back to I thinkmy one sort of when I finish on this isit's not an unfamiliar message to any ofyou you know without the products andservices in place we cannot make it acompelling reasonto go to our business owners our financeowners our application teams and saycome on guys there's no reason why youshould not be modernizing and migratingyour servicesI think chakra that's it yeah over toyou for questionsthank you soyou know I cannot be more fortunate thanhaving you know HSBC and Gareth what isthe customer and as a partner I thinklike the entire story is like music formy ears and we're really happy tocontinue that with ledb rudb Omni so Ihope that you're now convinced thatdatabase migrations is a complex Proproblem but we got you covered in Googlecloud and with our organization you canget started today everything thatrepresentative here is GAO available forin preview you can just go to theconsole start using it we have thedocumentation and there are multiplesign up forms both in the DMS site andin the consolejust send us a sign up or give us youremail and I personally will contact you[Applause]"
