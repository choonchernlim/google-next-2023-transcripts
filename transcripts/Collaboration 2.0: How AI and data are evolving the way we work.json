partner organization at GoogleCloud looking after a series of ourpartners including the AI and businessapplications isv partners and you are inthe collaboration 2.0 session how Ai anddata is actually changing thecollaboration space and we are superexcited to talk more to you about thattoday so uh this is actually a veryinteresting exciting theme so I'm veryexcited to hear about what our panelistsare going to bring to us today sojoining me here I have Brian Goldsteinfrom Google CloudI have Dan Connell from diopad and JohnRaco from open text so let's heardirectly from them as we go through theinterest Brianhey everybody how's it going it's niceto see everyone thanks for being here atthe end of the daymy name is Brian Goldstein as said and Ilook after our go to market motion forAI globally at Google Cloudso I'm Dan O'Connell the chief Ai andstrategy officer at dial pad I've beenat dialpad for five years they acquiredmy startup which is a real-time speechRec and NLP startup and then dial pad'sa customer intelligence platform wepower voice video meetings on any deviceanywhere in the world and then helpbusinesses understand what's happeningwithin those conversations so thrilledthe bill hereI'm John Radko a senior vice presidentof engineering for OpenText I joinedOpenText in 2014 when they acquired mycompany gxsOpenText is a huge company it's probablythe biggest software company you'venever heard of about 25 000 peoplearound the world 180 countriesum the areas I represent are contentmanagement digital experience our B2Btrading platform business Network andplatform engineering but but theOpenText goes way further than thataround security developer tools cybercyber security Arc site a whole bunchand including Mainframe modernization soreally excited to be hereexcellent excellent so let me frame thissession a little bit for you today socertainly Google Cloud we are involvedwith a series of our partners across theentire stack going for foundation modelspartners that are working with us on thetooling for AI and the area andcertainly the partners that get ourstack and innovate on top and thissession is particularly near and dear tomy heart because it's how thistechnology is infusing itself into thecollaboration tools that we use everyday to communicate with one another andto be productive in the workspace soit's super exciting to hear the point ofviews of several of them here Brian isgoing to bring the voice of the customerfrom his job here at Google and here inden and and John's point of view as wellso let's begin with our first questionhere so I wanted to hear from you Brianwhat are the keyissues and challenges the organizationsare facing when they are looking atincreasing their Workforce andcollaboration today todayyeah thanks for the question so I meanfirst of all there's no there's no doubtthat the need for collaboration in ourexperience is only going up when youlayer on top of that this return tooffice versus not return to officedepending on what week we're in and whowe're talking about there's an enormousamount of pressure that's been added toeveryone's work life in terms of beingable to collaborate with with folks thatare part of the job and part of the taskin front of themthe other thing that I think we'velearned over and over in the sciencefairs this out is that teams are reallythe most effective way to get most workdone we're not operating in silos we'renot operating independently and we cansort of cross that proverbial line andgrab the rest of the folks from variousfunctions to join us on the Journey ofgetting work accomplished we seem to bea lot more effective and we come up withmuch richer results and so that'sdriving a need for for richercollaboration of course and then on topof that the combination of justtechnological Evolution and the pace atwhich we're all consuming information Ithink has added an enormous amount ofpressure on all of us to deliver resultsat a much more rapid clip than everbefore so you put all those thingstogether and I think you're in a littlebit of this perfect storm where youabsolutely have to have a collaborationtool set that enables you to do workeffectively and I think this is a bigtopic on a regular basis certainly onethat we find ourselves talking about inthe market absolutely absolutely Dan howabout from your Vantage Point yeah Ithink for for us what we've seen youknow fortunately as I said we powerCommunications on any device anywhere inthe world and covid obviouslyaccelerated this trend of hey if you'rea business that's not been on the cloudyou have to move to the cloud suddenlyyou have to figure out how to managethat software but also suddenly you haveall of these remote employees and thequestion then comes how do we shareinformation how do I know what peopleare doing if you think of theopportunities and service and supporthow do we engage with customers and so Ithink you know we'll get into kind ofthe use cases and opportunities for GenAI but those are all of the challengesthat I think have popped up specificallyin the communications collaborationspace for usawesome John yeah I agree with whateverybody said so far and I want to addone of the hardest parts is to give isto empower teams with information so ifyou think about it in a collaborationhow much time is spent digging forinformation and finding out what theorganization collectively knows alreadybut that the team members have to go outif it's so much more impactful if theteam members can start with thatinformation available and ready and thenspend their time on Innovation and andproblem solvingyep no absolutely John and and you bothuh you indented on a key Point aroundareas of opportunity so we looked atcertainly how customers are trying toredesign their Workforce environment andfrom your vintage point where are youseeing John the areas of opportunityparticularly on Solutions like yoursthat are so heavily Based on data and AIin order to function and deliver valueso I think there's a huge number but I'mnot going to bore everybody with all ofthem there's two I wanted to share thefirst is this idea of content generationgetting a first draftso a lot of times people struggle withlike the empty page syndrome and so whatwe're trying to do is put into some ofour products like our experienceofferings the ability to kind of type ina text sentence and get like you know Ineed an outbound notification about apower outage for a utility company thisokay we're not there yet butit started and gets you collaboratingthe second one is this ability toaddress what I was talking about earlierto go course across and bring backsummaries of information to get teamsstarted to hunt down and find what wealready know I mean if you think aboutyou're going to go visit an importantclient we have tons of data on thatclient but it's spread all over theplace can we go out and gather it sothose areas we're looking at but that'sunique to kind of our business that'sawesome Brian what do you get from acustomer vantage point and what arecustomers telling us about these verysame opportunitiesyeah I mean candidly I think we are insort of the early Innings of some ofthis generative AI uh Evolution and asit relates to collaboration I think whatwe're seeing is that tons and tons ofcustomers are exploring ways that theycan take largely existing internalcollaborative processes and overlaygenerative AI to make them moreeffective or more efficient what I'mmost excited about candidly are theplaces and they're they're less frequentbut the places where we see incrediblyinnovative ideas to not just impact thecustomers who are consuming thecollaboration platform but the customersof those customers and I think that'swhere the biggest Tam is the biggestopportunity not just for us as aprovider of these Solutions collectivelybut also just for the market I thinkthat's where this whole thing reallyreally explodes and some amazingopportunities start to surface foreverybody at that point yeah noabsolutely and building on that what arethese strategy actually is that thecustomers are employing in order to goafter that then what's your point ofview on that yeah in terms of strategiesI think the biggest thing is um there'sobviously a plethora of opportunitieswhen you think about how to apply AI Ialways tell people as a strategy is goand find one problem and focus on thatone problem don't try to implement AIacross every different team and everydifferent business unitum for us we really focus for us as acustomer intelligence platform we reallyfocus on teams that are Revenue focusedand how do we help them drive morerevenue or reduce churn because that'sgoing to impact they're both their topand bottom line and so usually my adviceto those businesses is hey Revenuegenerating teams and service teams aregreat places to start with AI there'stangible benefits and again some prettyeasy implementations that we'll get inand talk about too absolutely John howabout youI couldn't agree more I think peopleneed to experiment and you need toexperiment by focusing on outcomes sodon't dwell so much on the technologybut think about a problem that you'vebeen working on the one area and I thinkeveryone will agree is the one areayou've got to put some thought to upfront is security and privacy and I'msure we'll talk more about that butbesides security and privacy I think youshould not be afraid to make mistakes orworry that you're you know you haven'tthought it through all the way I thinkit's a great time to be experimentingwith this technologyexcellent Brian anything to add no Iwould just say I really like what youjust said I think it's really importantI I run into a lot of conversationswhere executives are spinning a littlebit like they want very much to getinvolved and they want to do this workbut they're not entirely sure how to doit in a way that's either going to makeor save them money and there's alsosometimes fear around taking too big ofa leap and then finding yourself in thedeep end of the pool so to speak and sowhat I often encourage people to do ismake sure you do take a step you don'twant to miss This Magic Moment so tospeak but be incredibly thoughtful aboutit and contemplate the things that we'retalking about like security and sort ofsocial benefit and making sure that youtry to do things in the most risk-freeway possible but certainly take stepsand ground them in either making orsaving money for your organization atthe end of the day I think that remainscritical to running a business yeahabout the type of problems thatcustomers are trying to address we alsotalked about the areas of opportunity sohow about we switch the gears all ofthat will require customers to redesignand rethink processes and make differentInvestments how did the future proofthose Investments so then you want toshare a point of view yeah I thinkfuture profile we're I was just havingconversations today and what I think isreally interesting from a customer angleis they now are asking us to go andshare their roadmap they want to knowhey it's not just about generative AItoday but it's about how are youplanning to leverage you know Googlevertex in AI Technologies in general thenext 12 months or 16 months or 36 monthsout and so I think those are justexpectations that everyone should beprepared for or whether you're in a youknow a lot of you might be developersout there is those are the questionsthat are already coming up fromcustomers it's not about just theInnovative technology that you have nowbut it is about what does that roadmapactually look like and are they going tobe picking a winner that's going to bearound because I I as much as the hypeis out there I think we really are atthis unique moment where every piece ofsoftware is going to get Rewritten it'sgoing to have massive disruption forsome of the larger Legacy businessesthat are there and people want to makethe right bets and so you got to leaninto that and have a clear story andarticulate that wellJohn I think a key thing is to not makecommitments too early where you don'tneed to and and Dan and I were talkingabout this in the lead upum this is one of the reasons both of usI think chose to go with vertexum we're committed to certain problemdomains we're confident our customershave had these problems for yearsproblems are Timeless I'm confidentafter the keynote and some of thesessions we've seen here that vertex isgoing to continue to evolve as new llmscome out it'll adopt it as new thingscome out so one of the ways to be futureproof is to not place too big a bet onany particular future at this stage thisis an emerging technology anyone whotells you they know what's going tohappen is wrong they're either mistakenor they're misleading younow that's fascinating and actuallyleads up to my next question socertainly we're seeing the birth thisyear of generative AI getting toEnterprise class users and all of thatbut it's not a one and done how do wekeep the culture change management inculture of innovation going as aflywheel inside of the organization whatare your thoughts thenyeah one of the the unique things for usis not every business does hackathonsbut I'm a huge proponent of hackathons Ithink one it allows you to bring yourengineering and product teams togetherbut we encourage our sales organizationand our customer success organization totry to partner up but the best ideasespecially for new technologies comefrom people their own ideas andsomething I think that's unique for usis we go through this hackathon we allvat from our executive leadership teamthe best features we do a company-widecelebration and then we commit toactually getting a few of thosehackathon ideas into the product so theybecome real but again experimentationespecially when it's new technologiesand encouraging that that culture ofinnovation I think is criticalI love that answer so but you took italready so I'm going to give another oneum I think the most interesting thingshappen when you have problem domainexpertise subject matter experts alignwith people who are skilled intechnology we have the subject matterexperts in our organizations right nowso what we've got to do is commit todevelopment training sending people toconferences like this and in the case oflarger organizations like OpenText we'vegot to actually create a community whereteams that are doing interesting work inAi and other Innovation areas across thecompany are meeting and presenting toeach other regularly I came to the uhthe cloud Summit back in June and itreally transformed how I was thinkingabout generative AI mostly from thecoffee conversations I mean the pitcheswere great but hearing what everybodywas doing we've got to create thatexperience every day inside of ourorganizations yeah no that's fascinatingand you all already touched on a few usecases we have a large audience with ushere today and what are some of the keyexamples and use cases that you'reexploring your organizations and that weare hearing also from customers on howthey want to disrupt generative AI intothe collaboration space Maybe we startwith you Brian this time yeah I I wouldjust probably say the biggest thing thatI find us talking about is codegeneration and code completion right nowI think that's perhaps the most excitingthing there's been for some time there'sbeen a lot of focus on sort of contentand that's still an incredibly excitingdomain and there's a lot of opportunityto evolve that but I got to say thisconversation around code has becomefront and center in every discussionthat I'm that I'm having these daysexcellent then yeah from the customerintelligence standpoint so digitaldeflection actually having chat Botsthat can go and solve really complexautomated workflows uh we get reallyexcited about the summarization of dataI don't think anybody should ever read atranscript ever again but not just thesummarization the categorization of dataspecifically when you get into serviceorganizations a lot of it isunstructured we take bad notes we throwhumans at the problem to try to labelthat data and get it in a structured wayto make business insights and vertexlarge language models are great atactually categorizing data if youprovide them with the right input andprompt and so we get really excitedabout the opportunities to helpbusinesses simply make better decisionsbecause that data becomes structuredyeah how about for you John the key usecase is these guys are pursuing I'llgive you two just for a little varietyfrom a Content management point of viewI think the most exciting thing is to beable to have a conversation with adocument so we'll we'll send in a largedocument something like you know 40 50pages and a contract or a statement ofworking and we'll start asking questionsof it know what what's the Dr commitmenthere how much time we do or what's theprice and it's really just magic whenyou see people using that second onekind of playing off of Brian we have aum a development tools platform calledvalue Edge and we're using AI both to dotest coverage analysis and then it willwrite you unit tests for the gaps nowagain I wouldn't recommend using thetest without further editing anenhancement but from a productivity ofQA perspective that's really excitingyeah no that's fascinating just thinkabout that example John Mason a secondago talking to a document if I hadshared that with you six months ago youwould think I was talking sci-fi stuffway out in there in the future no that'stoday that's open tax today so supersuper exciting so there are severalfolks here in the in the audience todaythat they are asking the question how doI get started so what are the tips thatyou you have with how do I get startedin generative Ai and start transformingcollaboration my company so John let'sbegin with youso I'm going to take Dan's advice andsay start with a use case pick anoutcome and then shocking but I swearGoogle didn't tell me to say this Iwould say start with either Vertex orsomething like it and the reason I'mrecommending that is you don't want tospend all your time downloading stuffand and setting up VMS and running itbecause unless that's your businessright if you're in the business ofrunning llms more power to you but whatyou really want to do is get toproducing some outputs early ondon't even think about going beyond thelab till you've talked about securityand privacy but beyond that experimentexperiment and start to get a feel forwhat's going on and see what's going onout there in the world excellent adviceyeah thank you Dan yeah to follow alongwith that I think the other piece thatcomes up isum making sure that you carve out timeand resources for this and I think forus we we have these teams we should callTiger teams which is ultimately we gocarve out specific engineering resourcesit's engineering product design they'retasked with experimentation they'retasked with building Innovative featuresand fortunately you know our CFO and ourCEO sit there and say look that team canbe somewhat unproductive initially butwe have to carve out the time to drive apace of innovation and deliver and sothose are things that I think createcategory disruptors is you have the timeand space to experiment and fail andyou're committed to that because youbelieve in the long-term productivityand and what you can go deliverawesome so let's talk about the futurenot quite sci-fi future yet but where doyou see this space going where are thethings that you're saying kind of aroundthe corner that's really going to takethis whole generative AI in thecollaboration space to the next level sothenyeah for for me I I talk about voicesthis last offline data set and I thinklarge language models suddenly as I saidwe can go capture those conversations onany channel any device anywhere in theworld we can instantly summarize andcategorize that data so I can give you afour sentence summary I can tell you thereason that you call the outcome I caninfer customer satisfaction and then youcan put a large language model on top ofall of that analytics so I think thenext thing that happens is the datawarehousing and how we visually interactwith software is suddenly going to bethis assistant that I can simply ask itto tell me things about my business andit will do that instantly for us and soI get really excited about yourcommunications platform it suddenlyhelps you understand the conversationsprovides Automation and ultimatelybecomes your CRM as welland excellent Brian how about customerswhat are they saying where do they wantto see next in terms of theseInnovations yeah I think dance startedto go here for sure and you know whatI'm what I'm having conversationslargely about is in the future this ideathat we can start to string togethermultiple models we can string togethermultiple sets of processes that canconnect from one place to the next andso instead of just chunking out adiscrete component of some kind ofworkflow or some sort of businessprocess we actually go right back to thebeginning and see it all the way throughfrom end to end and I think right nowwhere we are from a sort of evolutionaryperspective is these are somewhatdiscreet and inherently uh separatecomponents and so there's ways to bringthem together but it's not entirelyentirely seamless and I think wherecompanies would like to go and what I'mfinding myself having discussions a lotabout is how do we get there where it'sseamless seamless to the customer to thecustomer's customer and it all sort oflooks like one endless process and thenthe second thing that that I think isthe real opportunity is to take some ofthese existing business flow those thatwe've come to know over many many sortof Decades of business software mappingto automate business processes andreimagine them there's a lot of reallylike tried and true processes that haveworked for many years they're efficientthey're effective they're automated thatdoesn't mean there's not an opportunitynow with generative AI to just startcompletely over and reimagine anentirely new way to be efficient andeffective and for me those are thefunnest conversations just to kind ofreimagine tomorrow yeah no absolutelythe first point that Brian touched superimportant the ability to chain differentactions with generative Ai and createentire workflows that are multimodal ifyou haven't already take a look at ourannouncements around Google Cloud AIextensions that we made this week that'sthe way to get to their future today butJohn we haven't heard from you yetthere's something that just triggered inmy mind so I want to share that kind ofa contrarian point of view a little bitthink about something that is reallycomplicated todayyou can do it it has value but you needexperts and you need to develop all thisexpertise I was talking to someone atlunch about thisthethe level of problem you have to solveto use that technology is way high maybeit's a proprietary Big Data database orsomething like that now I want you toimagine that you're not just using llmtools to collaborate but you'recollaborating with them imagine we takethat code generation capability and theability to infer it and now it lowersthe bar so now you can use technologiesthat we already have but they're justtoo expensive in terms of time andeffort to use but their price Falls andand you don't even have to be from it toknow what happens when a price Fallsright when a price Falls you buy more ofit you use more of it and I think youcould see a resurgent of existingtechnologies that now become practicalbecause we're able to leverage AI tohelp us use them excellent excellent soum a lot of very very good points thatwe touched on to the use cases where tostart what's coming around the corner socertainly those are points that arefloating in everyone's mind here todayforeign"
