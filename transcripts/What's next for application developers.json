choice of language enjoyportability with containers maximizeSimplicity with serverless and speed upthe entire software development lifecycle with devops principlesbut let's face it while giving you allthese exciting opportunities the fastevolving technology landscape and theincreasing number of cloud services havealso led to unprecedented levels ofcomplexitywhich pose challenges for manydevelopers too so for example gettingstarted with a new Cloud can be dauntingand require a huge amount of cognitiveinvestmentand while you're building yourapplications in the cloud you have tostitch through this Maze of disparatecloud services and experience constantcontext switching due to informationsilos like different productdocumentation sites or developer sitesand also with this popular notion ofShifting left the industry's beenputting more and more responsibilitiesonto the shoulders of Developersnow at Google Cloud we're committed tohelping developers evolve as the worldchanges around uswe want to make your life better bygiving you a new way to Cloud that isfast easy and secureso rather than burning our developerswith an ever-growing set ofresponsibilities in the softwarelifecycle by shifting leftwe want to make your life easier byshifting down providing integratedassistance pre-configured automationsand out of the box security through ourplatform and through our managedservicesso instead of asking you to take care ofall this we can let the platform do thework for you now let me show you some ofour recent customer successeswith the superior automation brought byour devops and serverless productsVodafone a leading technology companyachieves a 80 reduction in developmentand deployment timeand Lowe's one of the world's largestHome Improvement retailers went from onerelease every two weeks to over 20releases every day by automating awaytoil with our products and with SREpracticesthat's a 300 times increaseand Gordon's Food Service the largestfamily uh operated Food DistributionCompany in North America they increasedthe number of deployments from just fourtimes a year to 2 900 times a yearthat's a huge jump and today I'm superexcited to share with you a few moreupdates from Google Cloud that canfurther help our developers giving you anew way to to Cloud by shifting down soyou can accomplish more faster moreeasily and with improved securitynow first of all as I mentioned beforegetting started with a new Cloud can betough for developers you need to stitchtogether lots of different services toform a complete solution and it's oftenhard to identify and learn the bestpractices you're you're looking for notto mention the lack of visibility intothe cost of all these technology choicesand to help developers address this ourteam's been hard at work to help lowerbarriers to getting started with GoogleCloudwe want to help shift the burden ofgetting started with Google Cloud downinto the platform and let the platformjump start your journey with usand today I'm happy to announce thegeneral availability of jump startsolutions a new way to get you startedwith Google Cloudyesso excited about this jumpstartSolutions provide developers asimplified Journey all the way fromsearching for your initial project ideason Google to getting your firstapplication up and running on ourplatformwith jumpstart Solutions you can quicklydeploy pre-built application andinfrastructure best practices into yourGoogle Cloud account you can learninside an interactive environment rightin the Google Cloud Web consolewe also provide cost estimation detailedreference architectures guides andwalkthroughs for each solution so youcan quickly get familiar with GoogleCloud products and accelerate your pathtowards building your own applicationsnow how about we take a look at this inaction please welcome a new on stage[Applause]thank you Gabe hello everyoneI am thrilled to show you what it's liketo explore a jumpstart solution andsince generative AI is a topic of thehour have you heard of itlet's Taurus solution featuring largelanguage models so let's say you want toimprove onboarding speed by providingyour employees summaries of technicaldocumentation or you want to improve thecustomer service experience by providingyour agents summaries of previous casesa customer had these are all perfectapplications use cases for llms so let'ssee how jumpstart Solutions can quicklytake us from an idea to a proof ofconcept that we could share with ourteamso here we have our catalog of solutionsand we see a generative AI documentsummarization solution so let's click todive inso this solution is an architecturebased on Google's Palm model so you seesome more information about the solutionincluding the price it costs 2.35 permonth but of coursethat could be covered by your free trialcredityou also see the products that are usedin the solution so the jumpstartsolution will provision and configurethese products for you automaticallylet's go ahead and click to deploy todeploy this jumpstart solution into yourprojectso we'll be able to configure some ofthe options but just know that all thedefaults work just fineso in just a few minutes we'll have thesolution fully deployed less than thehours to days it would take if you werejust starting from scratcha jumpstart solution dramaticallyreduces the number of steps you have totake to get startedso while this is deploying let's go overthe architecturewe kick off the document summarizationprocess by uploading a new file toGoogle Cloud Storagethis solution uses OCR optical characterrecognition to extract the text from ourdocumentthen an llm API call to the vertex AIpaw model with a prompt that willgenerate a summary per document textsummarization is a new capabilityunlocked by these large-scale generativemodelslast but not least we've got to dosomething with our data rightso we store it in bigquery so anotherclient or a downstream service can thenuse itlet's go back to the deploymentso all within a few minutes and just afew clicks we go from nothing to havingthis fully deployed working generativeAI solution jumpstart Solutions set upall of this for usbut now what I've deployed a solutionbut I'm a developer I have to understandhow all the pieces work together and Iwant to make sure it works on my data sojumpstart Solutions comes to help againso we've seen the one click to deploywe've seen the architecture we've seenthe cost transparency now let's talkabout Interactive Learningso there is an in-console tutorial thatwalks you through each step of thedeploymentso the tutorial pops up and it's goingto walk you through step by stepso in this solution we start thepipeline by uploading a document intoour Google Cloud Storage bucket thetutorial set one up set us up with onefor us and some sample data to getstarted so here's where you could addyour own documents to see how itperforms on your data let's check outthe sample doc providedso this is quite a long paper on lexicalfunctions and machine translation Naitopic I personally find this topicinteresting and I would enjoy readingthe whole thingbut I could see how for most people youmight just want a summaryonce we have our sample data thetutorial guides me to exactly where Ineed to go in the UI where I need toclick at every stepso for this architecture we're now goingto go to Cloud functions which handlesthe glue code for our data processingbehind the scenes terraform has set usup with a code and now we can actuallyjust inspect it it's already deployedready to go by clicking through to thesource codelet's go to the last step storing ourdatathis solution takes the data extractedby Google Cloud functions and stores itinto bigquery so we can pull up oursummarization run by running a simplequery right here in the bigqueryExplorervoila you know that document we just sawa minute ago it was automaticallysummarized and that data was now storedinto this table that the jumpstartsolution created for us all we had to dowas click to deployso now that we've seen the stocksummarizer work I can show my team aworking proof of concept with our owndata using large language models and AIon Google cloud and if my team likes itand we want to build our own productionversion the code is open source readyfor us to fork and modify as needed infact here is the repo on GitHubthis application specifically summarizesdocuments but we can easily modify thisby adjusting the prompt string so let'ssay I wanted to modify this to Biaextractive q a system or a system thatproduces summaries in differentlanguages easily doableso we just saw two things with thisjumpstart solution first how quickly youcan deploy pre-built solutions forcommon use cases rather than spend hourseven days on initial deploymentsecond how you can then learn aboutthese solutions from within the productand how it works so you can then extendthem so please check out this and all ofthe other Solutions in the console andwe cannot wait to hear where these takeyou thanks again and back to you Gabeforeigndemo uh thank you very much Anu it'samazing to see how quickly you can learnand build AI applications usingjumpstart Solutions you know I'mthinking about all the times that I'vewanted to evaluate a new Cloud productlike this and imagine just how how muchtime I could have saved by lettingjumpstart Solutions guide me throughthis journey instead of having to stitchall this together on my own now today wehave 14 jumpstart Solutions available inthe Google Cloud console for you to pickfrom all of these Solutions are opensource you can play around with itcustomize it use it as a starting pointto build your own application you canalso go check them out via the link hereor find them in the Google Cloud consolenow with these jumpstart Solutions weare again Shifting the burden down intothe platform and letting you do the workletting the platform do the work for youduring this initial learning andevaluation phasenow talking about AIas an AI first company Google's beenusing AI for many years to help ourproducts become you know radically morehelpful for for people for businessesfor communities and really for everyoneand with generative AI we're taking thenext stepwith a bold and responsible approach weare reimagining all of our core Cloudproducts with generative AIduet AI as you may all know is theproduct that's designed to transform theway everyone works in Google Cloudfor developers it can help address manycommon pain points such as constantcontext switching due to informationsilostedious researching and slow learningdifficulty understanding unfamiliar codebases and apis and wasted time doingrepetitive tasksnow with duet AI we're helping addressthese developer pain points and shiftingdown many of the common developer tasksinto the platform task like learningresearching even coding and having duetAI help take care of them for younow we announced duet AI in May at i oin the past three and a half monthstrusted testers around the world havebeen using duet AI well let's hear whatthey have to say about it[Music][Music]pretty impressed but give it here forGoogle Cloud since it can not only helpwith code completion but it can also actas a chat assistant for youit was right and quite surprising to seewhat AI wiped me back acquired secondswhich took me previously two days tillthe search and fineumAfrica[Music]allow me to get the entries that I'mlooking for without having to switchtabs in my browser or I have to readdozens of user postsas an infrastructure engineer I am lessexposed to application codingbut we do it I can easily debug and fixthe bulky code but all of thesesometimes I feel like I'm a softwareengineer although I amforeignit's wonderful to hear how so manydevelopers around the world are sharingwhat they like about duet Ai and howduet AI helps them write code moreeasily find answers more quickly andwork more efficientlynow as it was announced yesterday we'renow expanding the duet AI preview addingduet AI capabilities across a wide rangeof Google Cloud products and assistingmore Cloud users from developers andoperators to data practitioners andcyber Security Professionalsand for developers we introduce many newfeatures to the duet AI preview inaddition to features like codecompletion and code generation you'llNow find duet AI chat assistance in manyGoogle Cloud products to assist you withinformation and advice on coding relatedquestions and taskswe've also introduced smart actionswhich allow you to perform contextual AIpowered actions like code explanationand test generationand to support your compliance needs interms of licensing requirements duet AIprovides Source citations so that ourcode suggestion provided by duet AI canbe automatically flagged if it directlyquotes at length from a particularsourcenow duet AI today supports more than 20programming languages including go JavaJavaScript python SQLand thanks to Cloud code you can alsouse duet AI in many popular Ides IDslike vs code IntelliJ pycharm go landwebstorm and moreand to make sure duet AI can betterserve Google Cloud users we've trainedand fine-tuned the foundation modelspowering duet AI with Google Cloudspecific content such as documentationsample code and Google Cloud bestpracticeswell with that let me welcome Stephanieon stage to give us a demo of thedeveloper capabilities of duet AIStephanie[Applause]thanks so much Gabe hi everyonenow I want you all to imagine thatyou're all asked to do a proof ofconcept to show that you cansuccessfully share results stored in thecloudfrom python so how long do you thinkthat would takewell let's do it right now with duetai's helpI want to be able to upload a file andhave an automated test for systemintegration tests so let's start withthe local file with results in it andwe'll just try to upload thatI'll type a comment in here whichdescribes what I want and use the duetAIS generate code in the upper rightso here I'll go ahead and type out mycommand upload a local file to GoogleCloud Storageand let's see what it comes back withall right wow it did include andgenerate a fair amount of code and hereit includes the code and commentsexplaining each step data and cloudstorage is called a blob so the nameupload blob makes sense and line 28 hereis the core of this it uploads a blobfrom our source file to cloud storageokay let's add a call to the newfunction with our bucket and file namesupload blob is our new function and hereI'll edit the code to use our bucketsource file name and destination Blogname so system resultsresults.yaml and results Dot yaml allright so this looks promising the nextstep is to see if it worked I want toverify the bucket is empty to start butI don't know about you all but I don'tremember the command to list objects ina cloud storage bucket so let's go aheadand ask duet AI chatso what is the command to list files ina cloud storage bucketsee what it comes back with all rightawesome we have the command so let's goahead and copy that command and run itusing our bucket name system resultsso here we'll copy it downand add system resultsall rightgreat it looks like there's nothing inthe bucket so now let's go ahead and runit using our upload script upload.pyall right great there are no errorslet's check the bucket againokayit worked so now we've proved that wecan upload a file the next step is toprove that we can automate it so let'sgo ahead and write some unit tests sowho here loves writing unit tests anyoneokay we got like two people just me I'mjust kidding me neither so this is whereduet AI can really come in handy againso once again we're going to start witha commentand we'll ask it to write a test tovalidate the upload blob functionand we'll go ahead and click duet AI inthe upper rightand there we go okay awesome so it lookslike it actually generated the entiretest wowokay and down here it actually left somethings for us to customize and it'ssuggesting a main which we can use tabcomplete to add itand you can see here it also includesyellow lines under the code duet AI canprovide citations for longer sections ofgenerated code so you can check where itcame from and how it's licensed and inthis case it tells us to use the codewith caution and that the license isunknown so I'll fill out these variablesnowwe have herebucket name is system resultsand then we have our source which isresults.yaml and then let's go ahead anduse a different name for the destinationsince this is a testso now let's try to run this and see ifit workedall right great that worked out well andit's easy to upload files to cloudstorage and duet AI helped me figurethat out very quickly so now I'd like tosummarize the code here and send a noteto my team and I'll bet you duet AI canhelp with that as well so let's openduet AI chat and ask it to summarizethisokaythat works it's kind of long for a noteto my team which I want it to be quicknote so let's try other options likesummarize this in two sentencesall right that's perfectthat's just right and now with duet ai'shelp I was able to validate this muchquicker than expected this is a successand in a few steps we were able to useduet ai's help to help us create a proofof concept it helped us generate code toupload a local results file to cloudstorage get unstuck for any Google Cloudcommands I didn't know write unit testsand provide possible function calls thatwe can include provide citations on Longblocks of code generated to show sourceand Licensing and then summarize thecode so I could share it with my teamquickly you know I get why we call itduet AI it feels like working as a duetto build better applications faster withAI code assistance right in the IDE allright thank you so much and now back toyou Gabe[Applause]thanks Stephanie for that that awesomedemo I just love seeing this stuff it'sgreat to see duet Ai and action helpingdevelopers get more done faster now sofar we showed you a lot of duet AIdeveloper capabilities but that's notall we got some more we want to show soas a developerfew things are more important thanbuilding apis right fortunately duet AIis also available in apogee APImanagement now in apogee duetai can dothings like help developers build APIspecifications from simple naturallanguage prompts through the apogeeplugin integrated into Cloud codedevelopers can stay in their IDE ofchoice they can access apogee and getduet AI assistance right where they worknow duet AI can respond to the naturallanguage prompt and quickly generate anopen API spec that supports yourcompliance with your Enterprisestandardsyou can further improve the spec easilywith assistance from duet AI inside thecode editorand when you're ready with all that youcan register your API in apigee's APIHub making it available to your APIconsumersand that's not all with the help of duetAI you can make your API available in achat interface by creating an extensionfor vertex AIduet AI can quickly help generate thatextension and help you secure and governthe API that you're making available viachatnow since duet ai's debut at i o a fewmonths ago we've been actively engagingwith our customers to test do at AI withtheir developer teams in real worldscenarios now I'm pleased to welcomeonto the stage Mark Quigley director ofengineering enablement from Wayfairmarkbut first thanks for being here I knowyou're leading the developmentenablement efforts at uh Wayfair and youknow that's not a very common role in alot of organizations it's sort ofinteresting that what you're doing theremaybe you tell the audience a bit aboutthat role and and why Wayfair hasestablished it yeah thanks for askingum the rule is really critical becauseas you scale and as at a Wayfarer sizethe goal is to help all of our engineersat Wayfair go faster better and be moreengaged and by that we really mean behappier we find that we get much betterresults if all three of those things aretrue our teams are spending far moretime on code That Matters to ourcustomers less time on the boilerplatestuff makes sense and and I love thatemphasis on being happier I think yeahit certainly fascinates with me um somaybe you can tell me a bit like howdoes wafer actually measure developerproductivity yeah good question somostly we're using the door metrics umPioneer by the book accelerate and soyou know you're looking at cycle timedeploy velocity mean time to restore anduh change failure rateum those are broad metrics that aregoing to really take effect over theentire developer ecosystem so it's notsomething that we can really apply to anindividual developer and at A Team levelyou get mixed results but at a globallevel across all the way for your scalewe find they produce a really goodindicator of are we in fact makingpeople faster better and then we use NPSscores and other engagement surveys todecide on happier that's great and andit's awesome to hear door metrics beingso Central to that you know I know theDora research team inside of Google putsa lot of work into the academic researchon that and it's great to see it appliedin practice so I'm also curious likewhere do these AI assistance tools likeduet AI fall into the list of Devproductivity you know efforts that youand the team are planning to roll outyeah they Factor very highly sooftentimes when we're doing our workwe're looking at how can we help them gofaster how can we help our teams behappier what can we do to get them toenjoy their job more where can we helpthem write better higher quality codeand duet AI gives us a chance to sort ofTarget all three of those at once rightwe see performance go up we see qualitygo up and surprisingly or maybe not sosurprisingly we see the engagement thehappiness scores rise the most peoplereally like it that's that's great tohear the early successes and yeah I'mcurious like what are some of the keychallenges that you're looking to solvewith uh to add AI yeah soit goes back to what I said kind of inthe beginning we want our teams to focuson product features that matter to ourcustomers right if I go out to someplace and I say hey I work for Wayfairthey're like oh that's cool what do youdo and I'm like I made logging better Iget this sort of Blank Stare right butif I can say hey we just releaseddecorify you can take a picture of yourliving room and then quickly generateimages to help you see it in a wholebunch of different styles Mediterraneanet cetera et cetera their eyes light upthey're excited they're like wow I wantmy teams working on those features morethat's great uh although the people whowork on the logging stuff some of themreally love that too no offense to thelucky folksum well I mean look that's great I knowduring the evaluation process of duet AII heard recently that your team did ahackathon that was intended to measurethe potential productivity gains thatyou were getting from this maybe youcould share with the audience a littlebit about what you learned yeah lots ofgreat feedback depending on the specificarea you look at our productivitynumbers were in the 15 to 55 range whichis huge I'm very happy about that codequality was neutral or up and we thinkthat as we gain experience with the toolwe're likely to see those numbers riseand best of all again like I said thefavorables were really high people said60 working on more satisfying code 70 uhfelt like they were more engaged withthe work uh less boilerplate activitiesuh more time spent on things thatmattered to them and that wereinteresting to them to work on so reallyexcited about that well that's great anduh so it goes without saying we're hereat uh Google next and lots of googlersuh here at the event too including someof the folks who work on duet AI theproduct and so if you want to speak tothe folks here what are you looking forin terms of the road map what would youlove to see the product incorporate overtime yeah so speaking very selfishly formy role I want to be able to measure thetool a lot better so I'm looking to seewhat kind of metrics can we get aboutduet and how it's working the citationsare great but I'd also like to see whatis the acceptance rate so how often aremy Engineers accepting a suggestion fromduetum I'd like to see how often are thosesuggestions sticking all the way throughto the pr that goes to production yeahbut if we think about our Engineers I'mreally excited to see duet expand to therest of the software development lifecycle so it's great that it can help mewrite code it's great that it can helpme unit testcan it also help me do a PR commentespecially one that you know my productfolks will understand and like and thenmaybe one day could it help me answerback to jira and engage there and takeme out of that Loop because that wouldbe great well uh you know uh a lot ofgreat stuff for us to chew on and we'reworking closely together we willcontinue to do so so look forward toengaging with you and the team atWayfair on making dueta even better forWayfair and for everyone in the audiencehere so thank you so much thank youappreciate itit's it's really great to hear this hugepotential that duet AI has to help waferdevelopers move faster and uh you knowas Mark said be happier right such animportant thing so if you'd like tolearn more about all the excitingdeveloper capabilities of duet Ai andalso join the preview program to testthem out uh please visit this duet AIwebpage cloud.google.comduet-ai this is where you can get accessto the program we are in fact wideningaccess to the program as part of thisnowI wanna uh focus on another area herethough AI is very exciting but I want totalk about something else another aspectof enabling different applicationcomponents to work togetherwhat we call integration now as adeveloper you're probably familiar withhow hard it can be to connect yoursoftware with third-party systems likean Erp or a CRM and yet that's somethingwe have to do right building suchIntegrations this often requires Nicheskills or specialized knowledge of youknow applications and systems likeSalesforce or sap and even if you havethese specialized Knowledge and Skillsbuilding intricate configurations uh youknow it can be very complex consume ahuge amount of your time and themaintenance of these Integrations canquickly add lots of overhead now webelieve that integration is somethingthat should just work and the majorityof the integration work should again beshifted down to the platform instead ofbeing shifted left to Developersnow today we are extending ourintegration services to includeapplication integration a new platformdesigned to help you automate app to appCommunications across both Google cloudand third-party software without theneed for complex coding orconfigurationsNow application integration offers anintuitive drag and drop interface and agrowing list of built-in connectors withthese connectors you can easily connectto Google cloud services and also tomany third-party applications likeSalesforce and sapand using these capabilities you can nowbuild complex configurations and datamappings with a simple point-and-clickconfigurationand guess what duet AI also inapplication integration simply input aprompt such as use an incoming purchaseorder PDF to automate order processingand within seconds duet AI will generatean integration flowalso has your Enterprise context basedon which will automatically generateflows documentation test cases usingyour existing apis and your existingassetswith application integration you canbuild and operate your Integrations withminimal effort which can save you tonsof time to spend on writing your coreapplication logicwellso far we've talked about the variousways that Google Cloud can help youbuild applications faster and easierbut when building applications movingfaster shouldn't be done at the expenseof securitydeveloper security and velocity areequally important now Google Cloudsecurity is always at the center of ourproduct design principlesbut instead of Shifting the securityresponsibilities left to our developersagain we want to shift theseresponsibilities down into the platformfreeing our developers from handlingthese tasks themselvesin recent years you know as an examplewith the rising trend of remote andhybrid working companies are hiring moredevelopers that are widely dispersedwhich can lead to increasing securityconcerns such as code and dataexfiltration risk and inconsistentsecurity posture across teamsat the same time it can also cause slowdeveloper onboarding and reducedeveloper productivity because ofdisparate developer environments andtoolingnow to help address these challenges weintroduced Cloud workstations last yearat Dex which successfully went into GArecentlyCloud workstations provides fullymanaged development environments withbuilt-in security best practices ithelps enhance the security of developerenvironments while acceleratingdeveloper productivity and onboardingwith Cloud workstations Cloud admins caneasily manage workstation infrastructurewhile implementing consistent securitypolicies and for developers developersget access to secure and fastdevelopment environments anytimeanywhere via browser or local IDE withconsistent yet customizable tool chainsand the past year since the preview ofcloud workstations we've already seenmany early customer successesfor example L'Oreal the world's largestCosmetics company use cloud workstationsand shorten the developer onboardingtime from months to daysCloud workstations also help make suretheir developers across many differentcountries many different teams can worktogether in a consistent environmentusing consistent yet customizabletoolingand more importantly with Cloudworkstations they're now able toimplement the same set of securitymeasures across the dispersed teams tohelp make sure they meet the samesecurity requirementsnow besides Cloud workstationsanother example of us shifting securitydown is around software supply chainsecurityGoogle is an industry leader in thisarea for many years we've been workingwith the open source Community thepublic sector our partners to establishindustry-wide standards and Frameworksto help protect the software supplychainworking with open source communitymembers such as the open source securityFoundation we introduced salsa supplychain level for software artifacts in2021. this is an open source softwaresupply chain security framework it'sadopted by many Enterprises today andlast year we introduced guac graph forunderstanding artifact composition clockright I think chips is going to be nexton on the list of Standards here rightuh yeah but this one is aimed atdemocratizing the availability ofinformation such as software buildsecurity dependency metadata making itfreely accessible and useful for everyorganizationnow at last year's next we alsointroduced Google Cloud's own softwaresupply chain security solution usingbest practices for products like Cloudbuild and Cloud deploynowto move another step further and helpGoogle Cloud customers who are usingmany of our partner Solutions in theirsoftware delivery cycle today we areexpanding our software supply chainsecurity best practices even furtherintegrating those practices with ourpartner ecosystemand today I'm thrilled to announce ourexpanded partnership with gitlab now letme welcome David DeSanto Chief productofficer from gitlab onto the stage Davidforeignthanksthanks Gabe so one of the biggest risksto suffer supply chain security iscomplex tool chains connected withdigital duct tapethis is one of the top pain points thatare shared with me when speaking withcustomers all over the worldand I'm sure it's true for a lot of youas wellorganizations are struggling with somany tools to manage their softwaresupply chain and the complexityincreases the risk to securitychallenges from code being committedbuild pipelines failing and open sourcedependencies you don't know the statusofthis complexity creates risk and there'sgot to be a better wayso gitlab and Google Cloud arepartnering to provide a seamlessdevsecops experience allowing you tobring software supply chain security tothe Forefront of how you build softwareby combining the power of gitlab'sindustry-leading Enterprise Dev psychopsplatform with Google Cloud softwaresupply chain security capabilities youhave a secure by default software supplychain with unparalleled visibility endto end that will allow you to empoweryou and your organization to deliversecure software fasterthis partnership delivers an end-to-endapplication development experience thatis deeply integrated together providingyou Best in Class reliability efficiencyand security end to endthis includes everything from Enterpriseagile planning source code management CICD and advanced security and compliancecapabilities that are core to gitlab'sdepths like Ops platform as well ascontinuous container scanning artifactregistry binary authorization and ofcourse services like Cloud run fromGoogle Cloudthis will give Google Cloud customersthe ability to easily set up securepipelines in gitlabthat automatically connect and deploy toGoogle Cloudwith full regionalization and compliancewith DRZ requirementsto leverages seamless integration GoogleCloud customers will be able to launchthe quick start as nationally signing into the Google Cloud consolethis will you'll see when you sign inthere'll be an option to create a gitlabproject which will allow you to eithercreate a new gitlab organization orconnect to your existing oneyour new gitlab project will be set upwith all the connections needed betweengitlab and Google Cloud allowing you toimmediately begin to secure yoursoftware supply chain and your GoogleCloud targetsin that project you'll be able to easilyconfigure and manage your deploymentsyou'll also be able to use pre-populatedcomponent Librarythat has the pipeline configurations youneed to ship your code to Google Cloudthere's even a template optimized forGoogle cloud based gitlab Runners tothat way you can automatically push yourartifacts directly into the Google Cloudartifact registryand of course this partnership comeswith gitlab's best-in-class security andgovernance allowing you to fully scanusing our application security scanningtestingand apply all the governance across theentire sdlcthis will also give you all the controlsyou need to enforce to deliver softwaresecurely and provide all the visibilityyou need into violations of yourpolicies and any exceptions that aremadeand furthermore you'll be able toseamlessly configure and manage theGoogle Cloud artifact registry directlyfrom within gitlab allowing you to trulymanage your open source strategythis will enable you to have assuredworkloadsand assured sources knowing everythingabout your open source packages anddependenciesI personally find This truly magical tohave an environment where you can startfrom planning and work your whole dayall the way through to deployment inproductionthe best way to understand what gitlaband Google Cloud are doing is walk youthrough an exampleso first let's start with a buildpipeline inside a gitlab with all theapplication security testing alreadypre-configuredthis build pipeline creates severalartifacts these can be images orbinariesand these artifactsare produced securely and are signedwith a valid attestationfrom there they are then pushed into theGoogle Google Cloud artifact registrywhere the binary authorization policyGates can take full effectwhat this means is that only packagesthat are approved for running on thatcluster will be deployed if they satisfyall the security and verificationrequirementsso I talked about a lot of stuff reallyquickly in a couple of minutes the thingthat I want you to take away from thisis that this is truly exciting givingyou the true visibility across theentire software development life cyclewe're going to continue to work on thisand if you want to know moreplease sign up you can scan and you'llget updates we're looking to launch thislater in the year and with that thankyou all and back to you Gabethanks so much David this integrationbetween gitlab and Google Cloud it'sgoing to make end-to-end software supplychain easier and more accessible thanever before it's so excellent to seewell we covered a lot in the sessiontoday all the way from jumpstartSolutions which help you get startedfaster with Google Cloud to duet AI yourAI powered collaborator to help youbuild applications faster we also took alook at our new integration platform weshare L'Oreal success story with Cloudworkstations and thanks to David justnow we got an early sneak peek into someof the awesome Integrations our twocompanies are working on around softwaresupply chain securityand here's a list of sessions uh to helpyou learn more about the topics that wecovered todaythank you again to uh you know foreveryone for attending this session Itruly enjoy this 45 minutes uh with allof you I hope you enjoyed it tooin this AI driven world Google cloud iscommitted to helping Developersby shifting down instead of Shiftingleft we want to give you a new way toCloud that is fast easy and secureenjoy the rest of the event thank you[Applause][Music]foreign"
