the end of a long day andhappy hour so I won't say we're gonna goreally fast but I will say we're goingto be really interesting so setting thebar high for our speakersum our goal with the talk we have threeand they are we're gonna review thegeospatial analytics Suite inside ofGoogle cloud and what our investmentTheses and philosophy philosophies havebeenthen we have resulting from thoseInvestments we have two reallyoutstanding things to launch which Emilyis going to take care of and then wehave not one but two customers to comeup and talk to you about their Journeyso if we're successful with all three ofthese goals what I'd like to leave youwith is a feeling of both inspirationand reassurance that as you tackle thesereally gnarly questions aroundsustainability and climate change thatGoogle cloud and our ecosystem ofPartners and the other experiencedcustomers out there have got you coveredso that's what we're on about let's goahead and get started so to accomplishthose three goals we have four peopleright that's an over constrained set sowe should be goodum Emily and I'll run you through theproduct stuff and then Jeremy and Martinwill come up and talk about what theircompanies have done using the thingsthat we're launching in like you know 10minutes or as soon as I stop talkingum if you are watching this online youcan use this Glide to navigate the videofor the rest of us here we really don'tneed it because you all are stuckso let's go ahead and get started hereI'm going to set the stage just a littlebit and so all of us as data analyticsminded folks have been totally consumedwith one topic over the last year andthat is generative AIright it's everywhere it's everywhere inthis constant in this conference and tobe honest it's right it came and itdisrupted much of the work and much ofour priorities for the first half ofthis yearhowever that's for the analyticsindustry if you search for Google Trendsand you look at generative Ai and allthe related subtopics and climate changeand all the related subtops subtopicsyou'll see that climate change is 6 to10 times more prevalent than anythingaround generative AI so while we arefocused on gen AI large language modelshow do we incorporate these effectivelyhow do we incorporate these responsiblythe rest of the world like planet Earthand most of the people on it areconcerned about other stuff they'reconcerned about climates and it's notunreasonable to see why because it'sgetting hot it's getting hotter and I'mI won't spend a lot of time motivatingthis here but I did want to show youthese two pieces of data so the chart onthe rightum speakers right here your left I guessum shows the daily Global airtemperaturesince 1979 through to the first half of2023. so the light gray lines are 1979through 2021 the dark gray line is 2022which was the hottest year on record upuntilanyoneup until probably 2023 right we looklike we're gonna take that record awaythe article on the left side here orsorry your uh viewer is rightum you know this isn't just a result ofthe natural stochasticity of you know ofour planet right we are causing thischange and so as we are changing theworld businesses have to adapt to thisnew environment and so businessespriorities are changing in response sogovernments are trying to figure outwhat new ESG reporting metrics areimportant and when are they due and whendo those metrics get businesses theproper considerations in theirIndustries insurance companies aretrying to figure out how to manage thenew and higher magnification ofhurricanes right the one coming toFlorida right now the one that justhappened in La hurricanes in La reallyyeahso insurance companies are having toGrapple with this financial institutionsare trying to calculate the portfolioinvestment risk due to climate changepublic sector is trying to figure outhow to manage road infrastructureBridges now that they're actually beingsubmerged in and drying out far moreoften than is used to happen so reallythe question of where is sustainabilityand where is climate changedriving need for new analytics theanswer is pretty much everywhereand soif you have a platform your platformneeds to have three specific qualitiesto answer this challenge those threequalities are oh sorry I got ahead ofmyselfumwhen you've got sorry let me back up alittle bit wrong slideumwhen you've got needs that are thisprevalent in this omnipresent in theworldyou start to get input and demands fromtwo places one is the very top of yourfunnel right governments are setting upnewum you know Governors are setting up newuh reporting processes and yourcustomers are asking for new answers andso when you're getting squeezed fromboth the top and the bar both the topand the bottom your entire company needsto respond and if your entire companyneeds to respond you can bet the boardwill want to respond and if the boardwants to respond then you'd better havea good strategyso here you gothe strategy around sustainabilityreally has two aspects to it one of themfirst and foremost it's a data challengeright we've never been through thisbefore so we have to do research tofigure out what we're up against rightthat's a data challenge the second oneis a cultural Challenge and when you putthese two together Google feels like itis very well positioned to havesignificant impact here because if youhave the right data infrastructure andif your data infrastructure has theright capabilities then you can buildthe right culture to be collaborativeand to be Innovative and to be fastso here are the three fundamentalcharacteristics that your datainfrastructure really needsyou need massive and ready to gogeospatial data catalogs you needimmense storage capability and a lot ofcomputes and fortunately the geospatialanalytics Suite that I'm going to talkabout here is really built to highlightthese three particular capabilities aswell as it's designed around the twomajor data types that geospatialanalytics uses so here's our analyticsSuitethe um the Suites built on four productsthe pillars are primarily four productsbigquery for Vector analysis Earthengine for raster analysis vertex AI foraccess to all the Fantastic apis thatthey're producing and then Google Mapsplatform for sharing and communicationof the results that you generate usingthe other toolsand so let's dive in a little bit to thereal or the ones that we're focusing onthe session today so bigquery geospatialactually a little bit of a Nostalgiatrip for me I was actually lucky enoughto be the product manager who launchedbigquery geospatial at this veryconference I think In This Very Room sixyears ago since then we've continued toinvest to expand more functions and morecapabilities inside of bigquerygeospatial so that it does more and morefor youso we were the first Cloud at that timeto have geospatial support and obviouslywe continue to lead with our continuedinvestmentthe thing that that investment in byimplementing this in bigquery what thatreally gets you isdata catalogscalable storage and this is whatmassive compute gets you things just goreally fast especially geospatialqueries inside of bigquery so this is anexample of a pretty significant Geo joinand so this join is basically asked thequestion how many land Parcels in Texashave impervious surfaces so you'retaking a 12 million row table joining itagain with a 12 million row table theanswer has 4 million rows and Cloud SQLthis takes more than half a day it's12.1 seconds in bigquery we see thiskind of stuff all the time this is notunusual I did not cherry pick thisresult as a matter of fact I thinkJeremy is gonna Jeremy is going to talkabout some of his experience with thiskind of performance boost so that's whatyou get out of bigqueries capabilityherelet's dive in about as briefly to EarthengineEarth engines got these three primarypillars of differentiation the first oneI mentioned before the data catalog soEarth engine's data catalog is more than70 petabytes big and more than athousand different geospatial data setsthat are analytics readyso for example let's say you wanted todo an analysis over landsat images overthe last 40 years that's including allof the relevant images is one line ofcode in Earth engine the Earth engineteam has built a pipeline that collectsit from the satellite does all of thepre-processing ready so that's justready to go in your analysisum storage and computation we'll talkabout that one a little bit when Martinand Jeremy come up the thing I wanted toalso dive into is that Earth engine hasbeen in the market for non-commercialuse for more than a decade and over thattime they have built an outstanding andimpressive user Community user Communitygets together in events like this butspecifically focused on Earth engine andthere are 91 000 monthly active users intheir community that means if you're newto it there is a big repository ofwilling helpers to help get you rollingokay the last one the last pillar that Iwanted to talk about is one that'sactually growing here a cup this hasthis pillar of Partners has grownremarkably in the last two yearsand so if you want to do some of thiswork if you don't have a PhD ingeospatial analytics that's fine youdon't need it but you might want to havesomebody with that qualification onspeed dial and that's what you can getfrom the partner Network so Partnershelp with expert Consulting a number ofour partners uh so carto climate engineacclima woza several of them up herehave also built bespoke Solutions on topof the earth engine and bigqueryand when they've they've done thatcustomers like yourselves and thepartnerssorry just waiting for the truck to gobyumso customers and partners have asked usfor a couple primary things over thelast half decade of these pieces beingout in the marketplace number one ismore capabilities inside theproducts and number two is betterinteroperability because when a when apartner or a customer Builds anapplication generally it starts withwhatever the problem definition is thatmiddle circle there is signifying tyingseveral different pieces of the GoogleCloud platform together to generate thesolution and then exposing the solutioneither through a map Google Cloud GoogleMaps platform or through an API but thatprocess of tying several things togethercan be difficult and then it can bedifficult to maintain so we heard thatfeedback and our investments over thelast couple years have been to reallydive into interoperability between allof these pillars in addition to addingnew capabilitiessocovered the suite covered the investmentthesis now I get to hand it off for thereally fun part where Emily gets to comeup here and tell you what fruits thoseInvestments are bearingso much Chad so I'm Emily Schechter I'ma product manager on Google Earth enginethemeso Chad mentioned that one of the wayswe think about building an industryleading sustainability platform is bytaking an integrated view acrossmultiple geospatial Platforms in TCP soI'm really excited today to announce twonew connectors that make using thesetools together even easierso first I'll talk about using bigqueryand Earth engine together and what we'vedone to make that easierso as Chad mentioned Earth engine andbigquery share a common goal to makelarge-scale data processing accessibleand as usable by as wide range of peopleand applicationsEarth engine is fantastic for rosterdata processing like imagery whereasbigquery is optimized for processinglarge tabular data sets and is already acritical part of many cloud dataanalytics workflowsbut by using bigquery and Earth enginetogether customers can accomplish tasksthat are impossible on any other systemso to help people use these toolstogether we built an easy to usefunction to export tables from Earthengine to bigquery and we're thrilled toannounce that this is now generallyavailable to use and there's a greatblog post out on the cloud blog thatdescribes how to use itso the new connector is our first majorstep towards deeper interoperabilitybetween Earth engine and bigqueryimproving ease of use for workflows thatuse both Services enabling new analyzesthat combine raster and tabular dataso many of you may have tried to do thisbefore and it involved a few steps so bycreating the data connectors betweenbigquery and Earth engine we collapsethese steps into a single command andsince those middle steps were reallydata engineering data wrangling and notanalysiswe've not only made this process easierbut we're also enabling you to spendmore of your time on your valve Billscience and Analysisso for example let's say you were doingsome kind of crop yield prediction foragriculture so your workflow might nowlook something like thisfirst you use Earth engine to calculatebiomass from some satellite imagery ormaybe entire continents you bring thatdata over to bigquery use a newconnector and you now can continue youranalysis in bigquery for example bydoing a geospatial join with some otherdata that you already have in bigqueryor by using something like bqml tocreate a model that predicts next year'scrop yieldso we're really excited that thisfeature is now generally available andwe can't wait to see how you drivesustainability impact with itso next I'll talk about what we've beenfocusing on in terms of machine learningand interoperability with Earth engineand vertex AIso while machine learning has been inuse for remote sensing applications fordecades and it's been a core part ofwhat people do in Earth engine for along timethinking about that integrated view ofgeospatial analytics on GDP meant wereally had a critical opportunity tobring together Earth observation imageryfrom Earth Engine with the easy abilityto train and deploy deep learning modelsin vertex AIso Earth engine previously had anintegration with Cloud AI platform fordeep learning and since vertex AI issuperseding Cloud AI platform we wantedto both integrate with the new platformand also solve a number of pain pointsthat we heard about the old Earth engineand Cloud AI platform connectorso we're super excited to launch our newvertex AI connector to public preview soyou can now take your pixels from Earthengine and fire them into all types ofmodels on vertexso the way this works is that you takeimagery from Earth engine out to cloudstorage you train your model on vertexAI post your modeland then do predictions with this newEarth engine and vertex connectorwe have a technical blog post we havedocumentation and we have examplenotebooks that are all posted online foryou to check out and get startedso we're really excited about both newways that you can use geospatial data tounlock sustainability insights acrossour geospatial Cloud productsand we have today two of our awesomecustomers to talk more about theirexperiences using these products togenerate sustainability impacts so firstwe'll have Martine from Bayer cropscience talking about how they'veapplied Earth engine and bigquerytogether to power r d changes which isespecially important to understand howfood production needs change as ourclimate changes and then we'll haveJeremy from Clear Channel talking aboutusing geospatial insights with AI todrive sustainability Focus impactso without further Ado here is Martinfrom bear crop science thank you Emilyum hi thanks everybody for taking thetime I know there's a lot of sessionsand um it might be a little bit hard toum hear but I'll do my best um so I'mMartin Mendez Constable I'm the vicepresident of analytics and data for uhmentioned those around the crop scienceand what I want to do today is to showyou uh how we're using these productsthis technology is uh likely as childwas saying are starting to be moreconnected across each other rightum maybe as a little bit of a backgroundwhen we talk about vegetables r d inclub science one of ourcore missions is around sustainabilitydeliver digital solutions that influencesustainable products products meaningvegetables ripe tomatoes pepperscucumbers and so on that we sellum globally as well so in order to dothat we obviously have a very robust r dpipeline that requires us to generate alot of data geospatial data in naturemost of itum and in a global nature as wellum I'm not intending to bore you do thatwith you know breeding concept here butyou you can think about it this way soyou have if it's a tomato you have theparents and you're gonna breed themyou're gonna come up with a new type oftomato and you're gonna put that seed ofa tomato in the hands of Growers allover the world where you're gonna testthem right so are those uh better thanthe seeds that we're selling now arethey more sustainable sustainable uhenvironmentally friendly do they consumemore or less water do they have betterflavor better shape better colored youknow a million things that you're gonnacharacterize and measure right and a lotof that is is truly sure special dataand data that is collected once you putthe seeds on the ground in Trials aroundthe trials all over the world thousandsof plots that are planted all over theworld in about 20 different vegetablecrops in an annual basis where you'regoing to collect more and more data andthen hopefully use that data touh Advance some of those products to thecommercial phase right soone of the challenges we had on in anybig corporations this is a unique obeyeris how fragmented our ecosystem is interms of data and when we startedtalking to Emily and chat about using uhGoogle Earth engine and bigquerytogetherthis was one of our our premises rightcan we actually stop moving data aroundso much andum disclaimer our club science Warehouseis built on bigquery already so that wasa decision the Bayer Club science made afew years back where we are bringing allour data into a single Warehouse builton top of bigquery soum same as Chad maybe I'll share alittle bit of a trip into memory lanefor the last 15 20 years I've been umchasing down the product team tounderstand how we can use Googleretention more connected to Google Earthengine right so how can we integratethis data now that we have the connectorthat Emily uh presented we've been usingit already as part of this projectand that will advanceour mission uh greatly right we willstop basically moving data from all overthe place we have now the nativeintegration between Google retention andbigquery and then we can use bigquery MLand advanced analytics on top of bothum so in a way you can think about thedata catalog that Chad and Emilypresented and we definitely like toleverage all the data source data layersthat are there alreadyum and in conjunction withum bigquery and Google attention rightso we run all our models train themvalidate them and then using the GoogleEarth engine visualization options wecan enable our end users breedersmembers of our testing teams all overthe world to see the result of thisanalytical models right so this isn'tjust you know our stock in our IDs orlike that or models or whatever ispeople actually seeing the insightscoming out of those models in this casethe mo the map that you see there onthat side basically a representation ofdifferent environments within Californiawe have used basically all theenvironmental layers that are availablein Google retention and we have broughtall our data from bigquery and we have asplit basically different environmentsaccording to how suitable they are formultiple different crops let's saytomatoes peppers cucumbers and so on Nowby using these platforms to chargepoints that are scalable you can do thatreal time globally right so no longeryou can do it in California but you cando it across the globe on every singlecountry where we are doing businesswhere we're testing this vegetable seedsum am I doing so you can imagine theadvantages it used to be very timeconsuming and very paper based right nowIt's All Digitalmom on top of that there's a lot ofdifferent features that we like aboutGoogle retention I'll just mention oneof them which is data Fusion capabilityin the days of uh you know 10 10 yearsago for maybe some of you that are asold as me you'll remember having to putall the data together and start to agreethat to some sort of common cell sizeand then creating all these derivativesof data storing them and then coming upwith an output of it right so thatthat's no longer needed because withthis data Fusion feature now we can doreal time on the flight greeting wedon't we don't end up creating so muchmore data that nobody's going to use andthis actually takes two lines of code inGoogle retention you used to take youknow a data scientist hours and hoursand hours of coding and you end upcreating a lot of data that was going towaste anyway now with a handful of linesof code we can do this real time andhave this output allum we like to use the Uber concept of ahexagon grids so we like to use the H3indices to um to grid all these data toa common a common cell sizenow let's look at it how the impacts ourbusiness right because this isn't just rd for the sake of the doing data sciencebut we do want to end up impacting ourbusiness so we are we have a very robustnumber one pipeline in in the world whenit comes to vegetables r d we had tocreate more products that Growers wouldwant whether it's better tastingtomatoes or you know more sustainableum bell peppers because they use lesswater or they're more resistant to aparticular Pest and disease you know wehave to keep advance in our pipelinerightputting all these things together now wehave the advantages of the data catalogthe processing the modeling and all thisvisualization now this colors that yousee on this map of Italy are the sameconcept of environmental clustering aswe call it applied to a very differentgeography before it was California nowit's Italy now also you can look acrosscountries right so you can see whattomatoes are better suited for Italyversus California and maybe there's aparticular cultivar or hybrid thatapplies to both that can perform verywell in both that's not always the casebut just to give you an example now andyou can run it like I said before acrossevery single country in the world veryvery fast then you can influence Yourshermoplasm Design right so in theexample you have cauliflower you knowsome people like white caulifloweryellow cauliflower purple cauliflower asmaller head a bigger hair you can useall that data that is collected acrossall the trials that we're runningand inform basically our pipelineAdvanced products that are not just moresustainable but the consumers areseeking more right and ultimately youcan also use digital phenotype in all ofthese Technologies put togetherinfluence where we deploy sensors on thefield on our r d trials do not just notlook at things and access color but nowmeasure color with sensors on the groundright whether it's a UAV or a sensormounted on on a small robot inside agreenhouse or an open field trial youcan put it all together and you can mineall this data in ways that we couldnever dream ofI'm gonna stop there and I'm gonna givenowum the word to share me so he can walkyou through how they are implementingGoogle Earth engine and bigquery thankyouhi everyone can you hear mehi everyonemy name is Jeremy Flynn I'm the seniorvice president of data products andstrategy at Clear Channel outdoor whereI oversee audience and measurementsolutions to run effective out of homeadvertising campaigns so yes you get tohear from a billboard guy out of cloudconferenceat Clear Channel I build audiencesolutions that match the right locationwith the right audiences to build thebest performing out of home audienceplans possibleyou probably have seen our ads no matterhow you got to this conference whetheryou landed at SFO or Oakland or San Josewhere you drove up the 101 or outsidethe Moscone Center where you walked intoday we have thousands of advertisingad units in the city of San Franciscoand my hope for today is you ever younever not notice them after this sessionright nowour industry the adipo industry ismaking deep commitments towards becomingmore sustainable whether that is puttingsolar panels on top of our bus shelterad units to reduce our Reliance on thegrid or making the slow conversion to ahundred percent digital Billboards we'redeeply committed to reducing the timeeffort and materials that go intogetting an out of home ad campaign liveand and for all of you that might meanthe world becoming a little bit morelike Minority Report or Blade Runner buthopefully with a happier endingtoday we're starting to see much more ofan intersection between Brands promotinga sustainable message and the marketingand business outcomes they're looking todrive at the board level that Chadreferenced earlier CMOS are in thoseboard meetings and they're being askedto promote the sustainable efforts ofthe brands that they work forand I believe that effective advertisingwhen done right through the power ofinfluence could actually build a moresustainable worldthis happens when you can drivesustainable consumer behavior and actionover a long period of timeum I think a lot of you are about toremember this but I'm a child of the 90sand I really remember that got milkadvertisement that I saw literally allover the place on TV on billboards in myschool library and now as adults I I'verealized how powerful that simplemessage was in driving towards massaction and how we need to start doingthat today with respect tosustainability and climate actionso for advertising to be most effectivethat means aligning the creative oradvertising message with the right placethe right time the Right audience andthat right place normally is the rightlocation so an effective advertisingstrategyum means that like we have an ability tounderstand where to place the right adsat the moment of families deciding tomake a more sustainable choice we alsodo this for governments as Chadmentioned earlier it's hot we actuallypartner with a lot of local governmentstowns municipalities to actually promotesustainable messages and call to actionsduring times of natural disasterswhether that be advising people toevacuate during floods or duringupcoming heat waves we are there and atthe ready because we exist in the PublicSquare on the other hand with respect toConsumer purchase we actually work withBrands to promote the sustainableproducts that they're bringing to Marketand increasingly we see a statisticallysignificant increase in householdpurchases of these more sustainableproducts that can mean meatless uhmeatless uh Brands where we promote themright outside of the grocery storeswhere they could be purchased or moresustainable Automotive vehicles thatwe'd all love to see more of out on theroads todayat Clear Channel we productize thisgeospatial data through our radaranalytics Suite one to modernizeliterally the oldest advertising mediumin the world and two to make the worldmore sustainablethat might seem like a Bitty Pretty boldProclaim from a billboard guy but I'lltell you how we're doing with that dataone of the products in our suite is ourradar view product which I'm about todemo and we this is an insights platformthat is built on top of Google bigqueryGoogle vertex and one of our ourstrategic Partners cardo that thatcombines demographic data behavioraldata audience location location andproximity data to build the bestperforming out of home campaigns andsomething that Chad also mentionedearlier speed actually drivesperformance enablement not just for thesuccessful out of home campaigns thatwe're building but to trulyrevolutionize the business practices orthe workflows of our sales teams tryingto sell those out of home ad campaignsbut a major problem with all of thatdata is that there are millions andmillions of possible combinations andthe options to build a plan then becomeLimitless and so that createsbottlenecks it creates bottlenecks forpeople who we want to use our productsto turn around media plans that we wantto be selling to Brands and advertisersso that's where Google and cardo come inusing their technology we're able tocreate even more self-service basedcampaigns where we've introducedconversational artificial intelligenceand natural language of processing toactually increase the speed andturnaround times of the types of mediaplans that we're trying to create thiscombination of Google bigquery withvertex AI helps us produce actionablelocation intelligence and audienceinsights that ultimately helps us buildand and drive more successful out of ADcampaigns let's uh look at it inpractice so I'm gonna take a second torun the videoby adding Google bigquery and vertexrunning native within our radar Viewapplication we can produce geospatialAnalyticswhere we can first show all of ourBillboards on the map and then we canactually add in an audience in this casewe want to drive an audience uh whomight be in the market for buying anelectric vehiclestand out to the sideand then for today's purposes we alsocan isolate that exact media plan in thecity of San Francisco for hyperlocation-based targeting to reachconsumers in the city who might want tochange out their car for a moresustainable brand modeland so as this runs you could see thelocations or the ad units that we couldsell updating in real time and finallywe're able to add in a final proximityfilter which is the proximity of our adunits to contextually relevant locationsin this case electric charging stationsthat actually exist in the city of SanFrancisco and here there are three majoronesand as we zoom in on the map in a minuteyou'll actually start to see thoselocations pop up so now we understandthe ad units in context to the proximityof those Vehicles understanding theaudience that are most likely toactually purchase the product that we'retrying to advertiseokaythat's the videoand I was taught how to flip to the nextslidehere we goyou saw how fast that works and againspeed is a performance enabler but byaligning the stack and having our radarview products sit on top of cardositting on top of Google vertex Ai andsitting on top of Google bigquery we areprocessing hundreds of millions ofrecords of data to surface theactionable audience insights to buildthe most performative out of home planand before we actually migrated tobigqueryum we were working with multiple managedcloud service providers and there was alot of timeouts Maps weren't renderingand our sales team were not using dataon their media campaigns so we hadweaker campaigns after that we actuallysaw a significant reduction in theprocessing time like the example that wesaw earlier and now with over 300 salespeople on Clear Channel who've beenselling Billboards longer than I've beenalive across 30 markets we're helpingadvertisers large and small locallynationally internationally actually runhigher more performative campaigns andhopefully as those campaigns become moresustainable in natureand those calls whether they be calls toaction or more sustainable productsbeing brought to Market like Martin isdoing we're helping to use geospatialdata to help make the world a betterplace even if it's for advertisingso now I'd like to invite Martin uh ohChad chat up first and a few othersgotta leave it to the advertising guy tohave the perfect tagline for his uh forhis talk there so we're gonna we'regonna switch to the wrap up here andthen we'll have time looks like we'llhave time for a couple of questionsum so I want to I just wanted to uh saythat for Emily and me right from theproduct side the googlers who areinvolved in sustainability either fromthe product management engineering go tomarket sales teams our jobs we view ourjobsto deliver exceedingly performed andexceedingly capable products thatinteroperate exceedingly well togetherso that you all can go build you so thatyou all can go grapple with thesustainability and geospatial problemsthat you need to solve what's reallycool about that is that stuff that wasimpossiblethree four years ago is now totallypossible so I encourage you all to goback and rethink some of the things thatyou've been you know have that you'vehad on the shelf that you haven't beenable to do because the tooling willallow that to work nowum and so as you grapple with theseproblems I'm really really excited tosee what Solutions you go ahead anddevelopum and then speaking to a couple ofSolutions in particularforeignside we're so excited that so many ofthese Solutionsum especially a couple of them up herereally demonstrate the incrediblesustainability impact that customers arehaving with Earth engineum that's really driving change acrossthese critical problems of climatechange mitigation and climate resilienceall right so we are pretty much at theend grab the app let us know what youthoughtthank you very muchforeign"
