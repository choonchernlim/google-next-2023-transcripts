    "transcript": "foreign[Music]good morning and uh for those who willwatch the recording have a good day myname is Kendall Lobby I'm the head ofsolution on data monetization andability analytics at Google CloudI'm based out of San Francisco and todayI'm gonna actually present you one of myfavorite topicswe're going to talk about the businessof data so the business of datacannot be presented without talkingabout why data monetizationthis is one of the most and key topicfor all of us in the data industry weknow how to transform data intoinformation but how we're going toproductize itand learn how we're going to monetize itthis is actually a business model forthat so hopefully we're going to be ableto details your informationwe're also going to talk about how do weproductize data with looker I don'tactually know looker but preo to GoogleCloud I studied actually my career mycareer of sales engineer at Lucas so Iknow there are a lot of Lookers in theroom and I'm very grateful for those whowho made it to comelastlyum I mean not lastly but after talkingabout productizing data how we're goingto use Lucato power your data product we're goingto try to see what are the key featurescapabilities of the product you're goingto be able to leverage right off the batin your platform and of course I'm goingto submit to these very very difficultexercises to give you a live demo whichobviously just by the name of it shouldgive you a lot on how I feelso why data monetizationI I helped a lot of customerstransforming data into into informationwith many many bi tools and this isactually my I mean my personal favoritestory that actually unlocked me to behere today actually determinization Ididn't know anything about datanormalization I actually learned it fromyou our customers because you're usingour tools and you're productizing it yougo to market and then you tell you tellme you say hey Scandal we created thisdata product this is how we'remonetizing it so I'm privileged to talkabout a company that is in the businessof what we call it's it's space to Cloudbasically the capture data for thetankers so you know like all the tankersall the shipment the the capture likethe latitude the longitude you know theboat ID like a basic table correct andthe way they were monetizing data wasby just having an API and selling datatransactional like latitude longitudebut ID and there was the business andthere was like a four figuresubscription so companies like Maersk uhyou know hedge fund company could buythe data so they can analyze you knowdifferent you know Supply movement andand ships movement also governmentcompanies could track different boatsdoes that sound okay monetizing dataso we met we met with them and we saywell this is probably something betterto do to monetize these data so westarted to think about what how can weunlock value to these customers when itcomes to optimizing for example uh theroute of those ships so we created adata productthat allows us to visualize thosetankers in real timeso think of a dashboard where you haveyou know we plot the shipsbut instead of just saying well yourboat is here or your boat you know thislatency in the port the harbor ofSingapore or Busanwhat we say is how much instead of justsaying to the customer it's going to be100 000 per month or 100 000 a year howabout we tell the customer how much wesave them by optimizing the route bychoosing a better route so what we'vedone is giving more insightsto their customers and proving the valueof the Insight saying like hey I'msaving you on the fleet of like let'ssay five boat I can save you 150 000 offuel if you take that route this is thepower of data manage station we are notand you are not in the business ofselling raw data if you want to make andI try to for those I know it's going tobe a fairly long presentation but forthose if there's one thing to rememberto make money and I meanto to be to consider yourself makingmoney and and be a datamizationorganization you will need to unlockvalue to your customers that's gonna benumber one number two you will not sellraw datayou will you will only be able to sellinsightsI sound very formal but you don'tyou it's not a roomum another thing that with with mycolleagues and and our clients that wewe've learned from you isby 2026 probably a quarter uh of 45development company will have a dataproduct that will they will monetizeactually the example I'm going to giveyou right now to illustrate this slideis not a Fortune 500 company it's a CAC40 company it's a the company is calledCarrefour uh they are a retail companyone of their Flagship data product iscalled careful links and the productizeddata that they resell to companies likeUnilever Proctor and Gamble Mouse wherethey're going to basically aggregate alltheir transaction and create a portal toanalyze the market shares of a productbut also analyze and access competitivedata so they can understand where to putpressure on advertisement for certainproducts so this is going to bea predictionbut try to keep that in mind and thepretty much every company a lot ofpeople ask me is it just a digitalnative organization actually yesterday Ihad a conversation at the booth fromfinancial company to very traditionalLegacy company even device company youknow like the I'm not going to give thename of the company but you know likethe air filters that you have at homelike all the devices have now a mobileapp to prove and have charts to provethat the air quality is better that thetemperature is lower but there's alwayslike proof of valueso now I talked a lot about demonizationbut I also talked a lot about dataproduct what's a data product so you cantake a photo of of of what I I mean Imean so many definitions of what's adata productmy personal role especially when I'm alittle you know like today you know infront of a big audience I always thinkof a data product as an applicationthat has Analyticssome prediction obviously you're goingto use some machine learning artificialintelligencethe last one iseven when you define this data productone thing is missing here it's actuallythe audiencea lot of people are going to build themost sophisticated data product withoutconsidering who is behind this dataproductso if I may I know it's always in realtime uh you can have great UI greatcapabilities especially at theconference you've seen all thecapabilities around artificialintelligence machine learning dataanalyticsstorage stream streaming data neverforget when it comes to data analyzationyour number oneparameter is the audiencea lot of content here don't worry I'llI'll I'll help I'll help you unlock allthe content here when it comes tobuilding those data products rememberdata product have visualizationprediction analytics and an audience onepattern that we've identified is in thefuture and actually the future for someis the present for some other companiesa lot of bi companyare going to become profit Centerbusiness intelligence company or peopleworking in the data analytics are nowthe analyze Finance data sales dataanalytical data process datadisconnects you stay most of the bicompany are going to evolve toward amodel where they're going to becomeprofit Center all the insights they havecapitalized internally they will startto create productsexternal to the organizationlet me give you an example if you thinkof inventory let's say I'm a businessintelligence person at company a I'mdoing inventory analysisI can report to my manager this is theinventorythis is the stock I'm in e-bike I needto fulfill xlx0 now I can create a dataproduct inside the web application whereI provide for example on the e-commercepage I can provide the inventory forexample for you and I can say well youwant to buy this e-bike my inventory kpisays there are only two bikes leftso when I'm in the scenario of businessintelligence I can analyze my inventoryif I unlock value to you I can basicallycreate a new Behavior to speed upyour behavior of creating a transactionand hopefully buying the bike I don'tknow if there was aeloquantexample but transformation from businessintelligencefrom cost center to profit Center issomething that we see across the boardbut I'll give you a better examplenowwhen we talked about databization I readso many papers on you know the economicFinancial Times data is the new oil andI was like wow that's I mean I talked toevery companies every day so I'm talkingto very very rich people every dayactually monetizing the data is notsomething you can monetize data is apotential resourcethat only what only once you're going totransform it and reach ityou will be able to monetize but howyou're going to do that actually there'sonly three ways to Market your dataobviously I invite you to challenge mewhen I leave the room but there are onlythree way to monetize dataat the bottom the first principle iscalled indirect monetization this is inmy personal opinion the thing that youshould save bookmark screenshot this isthe most powerful go to market motion ofdatain the world in the recognization andI'll come back to it the second one isdirect monetizationand the third one is a combination ofboth and I'll give you some more detailbut the diamond is basically indirectplus the optimization and also you'regoing to provide extra service to yourcustomers so it's not just going to be aproduct it could be Consulting it couldbe customer success but you're going tohelp your customers understanding yourdata so indirect monetizationis everything that you use but you don'teven know you're using it let's say youare trading stocks or you are trading acryptocurrency or you're on a portal foryour real estate you're looking to buyyour house you see all those metricsthey're going to influence your behaviorfor example you want to trade uh Bitcoinyou're going to see peer comparisonyou're going to say oh today 80 of thepeople are buying this stock for thosepeople in the room who are dataSpecialists this is a peer comparisonanalysisonce put in a product for a consumerit's going to change my behavior andconfirm that yeah maybe I should buy itin the recognization will only be seenfor consumerswhat does that mean consumers likemyself we don't buy data like if I buylike a a bike or a connected device I'mnot going to buy the data to know aboutmy performanceso if you think of I mean for all of youin the room who are in the business ofcreating an applicationto consumer the only go to marketstrategy viable it's going to beindirect organization and what is in theequalization is everything to do theproof of value customer acquisitionretention you're going to basicallyprovide metrics that give value to yourcustomers but you're going to give itfor freethedirectation is going to be forbusinesses what is it a lot of youactually in the room have a enter I meanfor some of you in the room that are inthe SAS business you probably have afreemium offer uh for small let's saysmall small businesses medium-sizedEnterprise the further down you go tothe Enterprise the more you're going tohave data ethics package in your SASproduct so you're going to start sellingand upselling your customers with moredata productsand I'll give you some examples sohopefully it's going to be a clearer somy personal checklist that I go overwith every executive in the Bay Areawhere or every customers I mean in theworld isthe following oneremember where we say sell insights andnot raw data actually everydatabase or any vendors in the planetthat says you're gonna just share dataand make money forget about itsubscription is typically six bucksthere's no tangible valueto Raw dataonly a data product has a roadmap and isself-regenerated by your ability toexecute upon those products so alwayssell insights name your data product whyif you go on those pages of thosecompanies they say oh these dashboardsand reports whatever work you do it'sgoing to be commodity it's gonna be likea coffee nobody will perceive the valueof your data product if you work oncompetitive insights call it competitiveinsights if you have sales and revenuedata product call it other Revenue ifit's a risk management Insight call itrisk management insights productize yourdata name your data brand it and make itevolve it's it's not just going to beyet another dashboard in your productthird one this one is actuallyfascinatingintroduce every company that don't knowhow to define what I call Golden kpiswill failwhat are the golden kpis using themevery day if you take your uh writingyou know your application to to use a Iwas about to say Uber so Uber leave soany other application you have a scoringyou have a score for you and for thedrivers this is what I call the goldenmetric between your customer and yourcompany you need to have a contract as adata product this contract is translatedby what we call Golden metrics when yougo to your financial your brokeragecompany when you land on the page yousee your total your yield Patrol balancefor every every successful companies atGoogle Cloud we've been working withthey are all able to Define between oneto five golden kpisthat's going to be really like supersuper important I put some examplesscoring rating yield margin profitinject proof of valuedon't let your customers read theresults tell them hey I improve yourenergy by X I improve your your yield byX I saved you X prove them continuouslyin your product that you make them youmade them better actually the businessof indirect Organization for for sportsfor people who had you know wearing uhwearables it's the business of I makeyou feel better show them metrics thatmake you that make your customersfeeling better and then the last onedrive user Behavior create some somesort of events like heyyou have this plan plan one if youchange to plan two you would save xamount like you providesome metrics that allow your end usersto to move to one another plan oranother productum the the second thing that I'm lookingat once I have my checklist is isproductizing it so you can see basicinsights premium insights competitiveinsights people always ask me like howdo you know what's difference between apremium insight and and something thatis basic insights well if I take let'ssay A salesperson who come to me I cansay hey I'm going to give you your salesperformance but imagine the same salesperson come to me and I say hey I canalso give youthe performance of every othersalesperson on the organization this isgoing to be very helpful because thesalesperson with their own result cancome to me or just come to this dataproduct and and talk to this person whois the top performer to be like hey howdo you how do you perform so well inthis marketso this is a highly ranked in terms ofmonetary valueand by having this approach of dataproduct it will give you also oneopportunityit will give you the opportunity toTarget different audiences so many timeson the on the data product like you knowon my brokerage accountit's like the same dashboard foreverybodyum when you're going to create dataproduct you should actually segment youraudience a lot of you have clients thatare maybe small businesses mid-sizedbusinesses and very large businesses thedata product you design for them are notthe same some some of your customers aregoing to need like Regional globalglobal insights and like maybe somesmall companies they just need like somevery lightweight data productsounds a little bit abstractbut uh hopefully I will give you someexamples and and uh and when you imaginewe'll do was thousand wordsso we talked about data product but weneed to materialize those data productssoon looker and I will recap what's lookup and look here is a cloud bi tool thatyou'll be able to embed into yourapplication so out of the box within twodays one day two days three days theseare the capabilities that you shouldremember that you will be able to offerto your customersso you will be able to provide them notjust dashboards because rememberdashboards are commoditiesit's just a visualization you will alsobe able to give them the ability toexplore data like I see the profit but Idon't care about the profit I want tosee the profit for this particularproduct I want to see the product theprofit on this particular day so give toyour customers a way to ask question toyour dataso that's going to be the second oneexploration in my opinion probably thethe most most important capabilitieswhen it comes to datathird one API and is a typo so data is aservice that one is on meor maybe it's a new word data as aservice we'll see we never know whattake as in for usAPI and data as a serviceevery time you evaluate a businessintelligence to business intelligencetool or data analytics platform don'talways think of what we vendors GoogleCloud included we offer you out of thebox we we offer those products for youknow Healthcare Financial Servicesgamingbut what can you what you guys are soInnovative what can you do with ourplatform with the the API to unlock thetrue power of a platform because youguys are able to you know exactly whatworkflow you want to build for exampleyou want to bring an Insight rememberwhat I talked about the the scoringmetric you want to maybe send thescoring metricto a text message why because maybe youraudience maybe it could be contractorsmaybe you have a platform forcontractors they will never connect tothe dashboard maybe they will you knowthey undergo so the API will give youthis ability to create new way ofdelivering data where people actuallyneed it not everybody works like like uslike on a desktop and a laptop so itwould be unconsiderate to think thatyour data product for tomorrow is goingto be a dashboardlast one similar notesremember what I told you about theDiamond Services for your customers I'msure you all have customers that say heyI love your dashboard I love the extractdata that you have but can you send methe this column can you share me thedate I want I don't want a daily reportcan you send me by this country can yousend me by X also can you just send itto me to SFTP I need to integrate thedata here but I prefer CSV likeand this is why we created a it's noteven a scalar it's really like a datasharing Hub where your customers will beable to choose which platform they wantto get the data which format CSV Excelwhich column and at which frequents likedo they want the data when it's updateddo they want the data uh refreshed everyweek so but let them chooseand maybe that's going to be a premiumoffering for them like maybe not allyour customers will be provided withthese capabilities but this is what Icall often type the Diamond Servicesthese are your clients that know so wellyour data that they want more about itso you need to to be able to serve themexcuse meforeignso as I said this presentation doesn'tcome from me this presentation comesfrom you our customers and this is whenI'm actually of my favorite customersthat I had the pleasure to work with Idon't know if they're in the room ifanyone in drizzly of drizzle is in theroom uh I I mean Stacy did but hidrizzly is an alcohol delivery companyyou can basically deliver champagne andof course non-alcoholic beverage as wellfor those who who don't drink alcoholespecially for those who went partyinglast night I'm sure today you don't needa uh anymore called beverage but this isa delivery application that has beenacquired by Uber in 2021 and when wework with them they were doing businessintelligence they were analyzing thesales data the sellable product thetrends like you know is the tequila mostselled in the like the tequila whateverbrand is more cell sold in New York thanin San Francisco and they were analyzingall of that internallyso remember cost centerand what we said is how about we createa suite of data productsthat will allow us to go not providethis information to the managementbut provide this information to theactual producers of alcohol thedistributorsso drizzly who is a b2c businesstransactional delivering alcoholcreated a B2B business of data and howthey've done that they created one twothree four data productsthey listed and you can see here you canread probably better than me from hereactually I have a another screen sorryI'm not used to this setup they createda list of business sensors they can theycan answer like basic sales data basketmix competitive rankand what they've done is they've rankedthose insights by monetary valuebronze silver gold Platinum so if you'relike the Heineken of the world theconstellation brand of the world you'reprobably gonna have access to thePlatinum version of itand what you you should think aboutthese guys didn't even have a sales teamto sell those data products so what dothey doif you don't have a cell team how do youmake money how do you go to marketI see some people saying well yeahyou're not in a good shapedigitalit is it's a digital solution so whatthey've done is they've given Platinumto everybody you know why because theydidn't know what data product would workso they gave Platinum to everybody sothey were not in the game of likeselling net new data product they werein the game of retaining people maybe meworking as a distributor company maybeI'm only interested by the trend orwhat's been searched and for you myadvice is createas many data product as you can kind oflike a bookstore create as many insightas you can qualify them categorize thembecause your client is going to bewithin the company and they're going toaccess for example the competitive datafor example all the time and these arethe customers you want to capturedon't anticipate on what your customerswant create a catalog of insights byproduct and let your customers decidewhat inside is going to be valuable forthemas a side note on this use casewhen they got acquired by Uber think ofa company that got acquired that has ab2c business and also a B2B DataBusiness so this is something that Ireally want to emphasize on why is it soimportant for you to bring on this dataproduct notion to your leadership andnot thinking about oh I'm doing bi I'mjust serving insightsremember I talked about indirectmonetization well this is indirectmanage station you see it but you don'tput a name on it they give you freeinsights oh it's fun it's you know inMexico or in uhum in in France where I'm from these arethe top five champagne that people drinkand this type of insights are giving theproof of value and they give they giveto their customers a little teaser onthe full extent of their data product sothis is something that is done by thebest best best companies in the worldand you're gonna see it more and moreit's like top 5x top 10 top 10 bestproduct top best sellers and then theystart providing insights very verypowerful technique especially when youwant to create your go to marketstrategyanother client that I love working withalso I love their their platform becauseI'm not a very good website developerWix content content and website creationthey've created two data products withLuca one is web analytics and the otherone is site sales analytics so forpeople who build e-commerce on theirplatform they need to provide they needto provide a rapid way of analyzing dataso they've embedded looker with two formiframe an API I have is everyonefamiliar with the terms iframe and APIperfect yeah you guys rock you guysshould I shouldn't even be here youalready know all of my presentation oneadvice I want to give you for your nextgeneration of data product never startwith a dashboard a lot of people come tous they say hey do you have thesecapabilities I want to embed a dashboardno the home page is not meant to be adashboard it's you need to personalizeThe Experience welcome scander here areyour top products that you're selling onDC Commerce use the API create theexperience don't do a dashboard it'salmost like wow too much informationline chart pie chart maps and I mean I'malso guilty to to be overly excited whenI create a dashboard by adding too muchcontent Wix only one synchronization onebusiness question one answer excellentpracticeanother customer that I really love isplentific plentific is a propertymanagement tool they created actually 38product data product uh with looker butwe don't call them you're going to saywell scanner they only have one productit's the platform I'm logging in nowithin the platform within your platformyour services you're going to be able tocreate different data products fordifferent audience the data productyou're going to create for a singleproperty manager is different from thedata product that you create for the CEOof a conglomerate of multipleresidential and Commercial propertiesso something I wanted to extract for youhere remember when I talked about thegolden kpi their golden kpi is calledwork in progress their platform helpscontractors to do the jobs on onresidential and commercial property likefixing the air conditioner and fixingthe plumber the universal metric oftheir platform is the edge of work inprogress so then everybody understandsit and the second metric that they aredeveloping is the score of thecontractor this helps basically theircontractor to be better at their job sothe platform helps basicallyregenerating the potential andoptimizing the quality of services fortheir communityLuca embed so we saw some use cases wetalked about remember data productdeterminizationum and how to go to market but now howare we going to do that with lookerwell Luca will give you the entire thefull stack platform like from thesemantic layerum to the uh to the businessintelligence tool to the self selfservice exploration data sharingcapabilities you'll have all in oneplatform from business intelligence andalso external facing productsit's going to be composable rememberwhat I told you about the future of dataanalytics might not be a dashboard itmight be just a few kpis sent you knowtext messages or in your instantmessaging system so this is somethingthat at Google Cloud We Care a Lot weknow that not everyone works of adesktop and and web browserintelligent well as you know at in theGoogle Cloud family there's not justlocal I'm sure you've seen a lot ofother products Luca connects to BQbigquery with machine learning weconnect with vertex AI we connect toGoogle Map actually I will give you ademo of looker with Google Map the ideaand the way I think of looker is aningredient that is going to be part ofyour recipe when it comes to buildingyour your product so assemble thoseingredients like a chef and build yourrecipe and that's what the platform ofLuca will be able to give youfor those who don't know what's look Iput a slide together so I'll go veryquickly we offer dashboard self-serviceexplorationsecond capabilities that is actually oneof my favorite is all the workflows thatyou'll be able to do is like send itlike if you guys let me work a lot oninstant messaging system just send adashboard to an instant messaging systemlike you know I don't need to go log inand look for my dashboard just send itto the room where I'm actually talkingand having conversation with mycolleague last one this of the biggestTrend I've seen growing for the for thepast few years our customers don't wanttheir data product to look like adashboardand they say I want to humanizeinformation like if it's if it's asports analytics I want to see someoneyou know with the bat I want to seesomeone like you know racing the car Iwant to have kpis like a video gamethat's what our platform will give youwe are API first but I'll touch on thatmore it will allow you to bring theseinsights into your data applicationwithout being restricted to the canvasof the infamous line Child by child hitmap and and so on and so forththose are great by the way this is datavisualization is very important butumI think this is something that I wantedto disclose and show you because the theeverywhere we travel all around theworld people asking well because what'sthe difference between Tableau power biTableau and power bi you know the toolsare great products and I'm sure you alot of you are using them in in the roomuh I I it's I think it's just a matterof of generation and capabilities ourplatform is born in the cloud meaning wehave a semantic layer we are in databasenone of those products were builtremember in memory we were bringing thedata and then Computing we areconnecting in the database leveragingyour data warehouses the computationpower of your databaseand lastly we are web-based everythingI've been talking about is accessiblethrough one web page one HTTP endpointthere's no like uh other product it'sone access to local platformwhy is it so important to be in databaseperformances scalability was itimportant to have semantic layer whetheryou look at the dashboard or your dataapplication the the metrics that youhave should be exactly the sameone thing that also I would like you toto leave is when you evaluate your nextembediting solution or bi tool don'tthink about the visualization and how itlooks like think about under the icebergwhat you're going to find in databasearchitecturethe depths of API coverage look who isAPI first the future of dataapplications actually are anintersection of different API API forpayment API for data API for geolocalization API basically all theservice that you haveMission developer frameworksemantic modeling layer this one isactually Version Control like do youconsider your data product with softwaredevelopment lifecycle or it's just oh Ihave a request I'm just going to updatethe dashboard now treat your businessintelligence and your external dataproduct like any other product on themarket software development lifecycleiteration versioning and and those arethe things we offering and that I thinkyou should consider for your your nextdata index product and of course thecustomization and and actionquickly one of the flavors of embeddedanalytics three flavors pretty easy toremember OEM I'm sure everyone knowswhat's OEM so you can literally takeLuca brand it with your company name andall the colors and labeling NamiConvention of your company and you cango to market this is actually the fastway to make money a lot of my clientsstart and say hey Scandal we have anidea we want to create a data product wewant to go to market like literally likenext weekbuild a dashboard offer them offer toyour customer to your top five preferredand friend customer so they can evaluateand give you feedback and you can go toMarket within weeks this is the fastestway to go to market second iframes bringthe dashboard you build into yourapplicationlast one API most sophisticated but thehigher yield the higher return oninvestment more created seamlessintegrationI will give you a little secret most ofour customers use the three of themthis is like there's not one better thanother it really it's going to reallydepends on how how quickly you want togo to marketI'm going to go a little quickly becauseI really want to show youa demonstration because sometimes oneimage it was thousand words but rememberwhat I told you you're going to be ableto not only embed dashboards but theself-service exploration capabilities oflookerhere on this screen all you have toremember is with the API you're going tobe able to involve your designers yourweb developers to shape the datainto information that will be translatedinto for example here Baseballapplication or or any sort ofapplication basically the gist of it isdon't stay in the dashboard bring thedata into your modern data applicationfor those of you who have a technicalbackground web DevelopersI know how it sounds every time I go toa presentation like this and I see thatthey always say or API that's it so Iload myself to go a little deeper foryou guys what I meant by API is we'regoing to cover the security of theplatform we're going to cover the accessto the data we're also going to coverthe administration like you know youguys going to be able to create usersmanaging the productand also you're going to be able tomanage the content like subscribing toschedulers you're really going to beable to create your own productI provided some common API calls andthis is a preview of the of thedemonstration I'll give you for thosewho've been to Monaco and like FormulaOne you guys should should stay foranother eight minutesthis is a full Suite of the data I meannot really a personal creation of theproduct but it's kind of like therecommended product that you shouldthink about to assemble to create thenext generation of data products foryour company looker remember dataapplication two interfaces one human andone programmatic there will provideinsights to your clientssecond one bundled with bigquery thatyou know is like our high performingDelaware housing cap and database thatwill allow us to access data at thelight of speed vertex AI artificialintelligenceplatform that once Bend always bigqueryand Luca will allow you to augment theservices of your data product and lastbut not least RPG remember what I talkedwhen I said all look API has data we'regoing to sell data via API well you'regoing to be able to provide and pipethis API to RPG to create somemonetization strategy aroundAPI calls you know like those productsthey say hey I sell you 1 million APIcalls or you can use 2 million API callsso that's what the APG will help you todo soyou guys okay I know it's not it's along day three daysI can see everyone is fineawesome I see Samsung thank youso who are the Target and who are thepeople because of course you guys camefrom the conference not everyone is herewith you and I'm sure you guys missedsome of your colleagues so who who whowe want to help with this platform wellwe want to help like you in the room thebuilders we want to help the productmanagers content developers front-enddevelopers so everything we do aroundour platform is for those peoplebut the second if not the most importantperson are your consumers when it comesto data monetization so we want to thinkabout to look to look good we want tomake a beautiful product for yourconsumer whether it's b2c or B2B andthat's why we have all thosecapabilities around B2B SFTP send datato Google Cloud Storage etc etc so don'tthink of us of like lightweightvisualization think averse of likepowerful Data Insights platformso what do we do for the productmanagers well for the product managerswe give them the ability to spin uplooker within minutes it's right off theGoogle Cloud console you can spin uplooker build a dashboardyou have a link that says iframecall your web developer and say heyembed thislistening pad of code into the into yourproduct I want to see how it looks likeso you're going to be able to do rapidprototyping before go to marketalso and I'm sure it's very importantfor you most of your customers are goingto be it's going to be multi-tenant youwant to make sure that there's going tobe single sign-on authentication rawlevel column level Securities so all ofthat is managed by your semantic layerbut we abstract all of that so it's easyfor your product managers to create dataproductscontent developers well we want to makesure that whatever we build insidelooker is going to be added capabilitiesfor your customers so we arecontinuously growing our roadmap andproduct capabilities with visualizationthey're going to make easy access toinsights but also branding for examplehere you have the themes that we justupdated on our product availablebasically look at to look like yourproductand last but not least for the front-enddevelopers what we've done is and that'sprobably not for everyone but we have anAPI Explorer but I also this morning Iactually use Bard I updated this morningI used bot and I didn't know how manylocal API functions we look and there'slike over a thousand functions of thelocal API remember managing security andthe content so we we our API is probablythe most comprehensivepart of the product because everythingwe built in Luca is first built into ourAPI so if you have developers that wantto help growing the platform we arewelcoming them and feel free to connectthem with me and and and our colleaguesthat works at HookeroopsI think we've seen that huhall right let's do a little demonot kind of weird it's going to workall right can you guys see Monaco so Imean San Francisco is nice but Monaco isnot bad at allso we let me actually set up the ThePrompt here a little bit so we so youguys know what you're gonna see what wethought about is how can we create adata product by not just embeddinglooker but embedding a lot ofcapabilities Google Map bigquery vertexAI what would be the future of animmersive data applicationthat will allow us to analyzelike third-party data first party datareal-time data but also video datayou know almost like near near realsimulationso what we thought is we're not going todo a dashboardwe're going to use Google Map as thecanvas to put data inside so for exampleright hereI'm going to analyze the data of my twodrivers I don't know if there are anyfans any fans of Formula Oneand I'm sorry the data is only for fulldisclosure 2019 so if you see rightcannon on the leaderboard that's normalhe's not backso what we wanted to do is actually plotdataon uh on Google Map I don't know if youknow about that but Google map hasreleased the capability called 3Dphotorealistic that allows us creatingphysical uh visualization where we'regoing to be able to plot data andremember what I told you Luca is APIfirst what other product is API firstGoogle Map you have two ways ofembedding Google Map API and iframelooker API and iframe so what do we dowhen you have those products well youcan blend them togetherand by the way you you see this littlething here do you know what is thisso this is not actually a Google cloudor Google logo this is actually a Victorvasarelli it's a it's a painting so thereason why I mentioned that is a lot ofpeople ask me is that a Google logo atMonaco and I say no it's a it's a it'san outpiece from1979. but it's just a coincidenceso what else you're going to be able todo with this application well you'regoing to be able to create remember whatI told you data product differentaudience you can have the monitoring ofthe of the racetrack but you can also bein the cockpit with the driver and haveall the insights all the prediction oflike the tire strategy calculated inbigquery that you render in the UK APIin order to display it with informationwhere you don't need to train people whya mechanical engineer a race engineer isnot like me a specialist in businessintelligence tool they actually don'tcare about you know filtering slice anddice can be so painful here you comewhat they see what are the metrics thatI need to care about and that's what Ireally invite you to think aboutdefining your data product based of theaudienceand those are a couple of other ways ofof showing this application but ofcourse my topic was embedding Lucas sohow can you embed looker well there aremany ways of embedding looker you canfor example here I created somevisualization in Luca that I can add tomy applicationand I'm going to make a little bit ofroom here to add some other componentsso that's one way to embed looker everysingle visualization can be embedded forrapid prototyping I'm not saying this isgoing to be the perfect product but heyI need the inside self-service it'sthere pop it up in the applicationanother way to embed lookeris via API remember what I told youabout the API a lot of you analyzing I'msure data around you know bookingpricing Revenue bring them into theapplication so I drill down into thebuilding get the data where it needs tobe don't let me look at Google Mapand then open another dashboard and thenanother dashboard why don't you bringeverything togetherspeaking of bringing everything togetherI also wanted to embed looker veryquickly I build a life frame and I editmy iframe it's available in myapplication so then I can have reportingwithin my applicationthe beauty of Luca here is Luca cancommunicate with your application if youhave already mastered filters likeparent filters you don't need to rebuildthem inside looker the iframe can listento the filter so you can communicate andsay Hey I want to filter and I want justthe data from MonacoI think I might be over time but thelast thing I wanted to show you is theexploration and all the things that youcan do not everyone will need to see thedashboard maybe they have more questionsthey are used to it they've seen itevery day in your dashboard they know itthey don't even want to see it anymoreso offer them capabilities that allowthem asking further questions so you cansee here in looker I have my catalog andI can ask questions I want to see thedifferent reviews of the differentproperties and because yeah I wouldprobably get the first one with 4.4umI know I'm over time so there's onething else that I wanted to tell you isthank you thank you so much for yourtime for your participation you made meso happy today I hope you're gonna havea great rest of your day thank you[Applause]foreign"
