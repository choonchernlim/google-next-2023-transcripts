Googleworkspace career with Google Cloudcredentialsyou may be wondering what's covered onthe certification exam how can I bestprepare what resources are available tome well over the next 45 minutes we'llbe covering how you can do just thatwe'll also be answering your questionsso please keep those in mind and we'llbe sure to get to them near the end ofthe presentation my name is Lauren andI'm the content manager for the GoogleCloud community and I'm thrilled to behere today with Barry schmel technicalcurriculum developer and trainer atGoogle Cloudvery great and thanks Lauren and goodmorning everyone says Lauren mentionedI'm Barry schmel and I'm with thelearning Services team and I've actuallybeen at Google for almost 16 years nowand 16 years ago it was all about GoogleApps which we now call workspace rightor I think we called it some otherthings along the way so I'm reallycurious before we get started how manyof you have already taken the workspaceadmin certification exam anybodygreat why are you here no how many ofyou are signed up already have made thatcommitment you're ready to take the examso this is really relevant and hopefullythe rest of you how many of you areplanning to get certifiedgreat great and Lauren and I have eachuh been certified if not on workspaceother exams as well and just to let youknow whatever we're going to talk abouttoday is it's similar type of setup forall of our other certifications so ifyou're looking at Google Cloud platformwe'll talk about you know the materialsor the resources we have available toyouso once again thanks for being here andthat's a little bit about us I'm sureyou're curious about today's agenda sowe're going to have a quick overviewabout specifically the professionalGoogle workspace administratorcertification we'll show you some of theonline resources and then we're going togo a little deeper into the specifictopics because you'll see with thisparticular certification there are fivesections or five topic areas that you'regoing to be assessed on so we want to goover that we'll also go through someexam tips as I mentioned both of us havebeen here gone through this experienceso we want to share that with youto be honest a lot of the tips arearound emotional Readiness like I don'tknow about you as an adult when I takean exam I go back to you know my SATs ormy lsats or whatever exams I had to takeso there's that stress factor so we'lltalk about how to breathe when you takean exam we'll also go through some twosample questions so you have a sense ofwhat to expect when you're going throughthe exam once again the format of thequestions are very similar similar nomatter what exam you're actually takingand then we have some planted questionsthe most common ones that we see willalso open and up to everyone and we'llwe'll also show you or share with yousome online resources okayso that's our bit of our agenda here sowhy don't we start with thecertification overview itselfand instead of just showing you theslide give me a moment I'm going toswitch over to a demo a lot of theinformation we have here is actuallyavailable on the certification pageyou'll have access to all this thismaterial but I want you to see who we'retargeting this is for it systemadministratorscloud system Engineers we used to referto this as the collaboration engineeringexam but we've renamed it to theworkspace admin because that's reallywhat it's reflected reflective ofum and as I mentioned earlier the examis broken down into five areas ofknowledge or areas that you're going tobe assessed on and we'll talk about thata little bit more but you can see thoseuh listed thereuh one other thing I want to mentionabout the exam is that when you do clickon register this is actually managedthrough a third-party company we workwith called Criterion Google as well asmany other professional companies thathave certification exams use that samethird-party provider so just want you toknow you'll have to set up an account onCriterion in order to actually sign upand take the exam okay so there's somegood resources there available for youI'm going to go back to the slidesand then as I mentioned already thereare five major topic areas that you'regoing to be assessed on on the exam andwe'll walk through those for you but Ido want you to see that everything we'regoing to show you in a slide is actuallyavailable on some of our onlineresources okayand then just a little bit in generalabout the exam I want you to notice thatonce you start the exam you know you getyourself set up wherever you're takingit as soon as you click Start the examit starts a two hour timer so you have120 minutes to take the exam there'sabout 50 or 60 questions on the examthat means you're you know pace yourselfthat means about two two and a halfminutes per question I think you'll findsome of them you're going to get rightaway but some of them you may have toread a little bit more so just rememberyou have two hours the format is it'sall multiple choice there's no Hands-Onhere most of them will be singleselection sometimes it might be multipleselectionand there are no official prerequisitesbut Lauren and I are going to share withyou what we think you really need to doto be prepared because some of you arenew to workspace so you may want to gothrough all of the training on demandmaterial some of you may already havesome experience so maybe you just wantto go through the quick reviewand then finally we do recommend havingsome experienceum because it's good to have thatexperience taking the exam as well butcould you just go through the on-demandmaterial and do a little bit of a littlebit more studying a little bit of theHands-On Labs yesokay cool and we're going to takequestions a little bit laterso this is where it gets a little bitmore interesting andum we're doing good rightso um we actually recommend these fivesteps to uh preparing taking the examand I actually want to show you the nextslide because we break it down in alittle bit more detail so the firstthing is is you probably want to justassess where you are so all of ourcertification exams before you take anyof the training have a preparing for theexamand I kind of want to show you that hereand as you're pulling that up I'llmention this step was really importantfor me when I'm taking the certificationexam because it helps me evaluate howmuch extra time I need to study or toprepare in advance and leading up tothat certification exam date so don'tdiscount this stuff it's important andit's really helpful and will set you upfor success as you're preparing that'sgreat and I think some of you that arecoming into this thinking oh I've beenan administrator I'm I think I'm readyfor the exam this is a good littleresource to go through it's basicallyall self-paced there's you know a coupleof documents to read there are a coupleof Assessments that you can take thatreally help you decide if you'reprepared for it some people that aregoing through training always like tomaybe assess yourself first then maybetry this again at the end but this isthe newest thing we've introduced in2023 to really help you all of ourcustomers prepare for the certificationexam okay the second area is aboutlearning okay so once again instead ofshowing you the slide I'll just show youthe resource so in Cloud skills boost aswell as other learning platforms that wepartner with like Coursera we still havestuff on pluralsight some of this stuffyou see on other platforms as wellthey're specifically the workspaceadministrator learning path and there'sa lot of on-demand videos here andthere's actually athere's actually a quest here as wellfor you to take in terms of Hands-Onactivities okay I'm also a believer thatanybody who is a system administrator ismost effective if you understand theuser experienceso we also have introduced I think itwas two years ago on-demand learningpath for a G Suite user training so thiswill walk you and also your end users aswell if you wish through all the variouscore Services it actually uses a casestudy it's a fun it's actually a funtraining program we want awards for itokay have you taken it won't walkthrough it I have and I would recommendif you are an admin you have a team youhave users and you're trying to grow theadoption of Google workspace this is agreat resource that you can point themto to take as well as an end user so Ithink it's beneficial for both you as anadmin to understand that end userexperience and also for your end usersto take it and learn what's possiblewith with Google workspace has anyone inhere taken the uh the user trainingmaterialsome good stuff yeah great I'm glad tohear then it was worth our effort if atleast one of you has gone through it andthen obviously a very important part notjust for the exam but as an effectivesystem administrator with workspace isgetting that Hands-On so we do havethrough Cloud skills boosts using ourquick Labs platform a Sandbox you knowso there is a learning environment whereyou can actually go through I would saythe most common admin tasks that youwould through workspace okay and thenhopefully at that point oops that's thecommunity one here we go if I meant togo back here hopefully at that pointyou're ready and you're going to goahead and you can register for the examokaylet me go back to our slides hereokay and now we're going to talk aboutthe community amazing soas you are preparing for yourcertification and continuous learningwith Google workspace we invite

youthere don't be shy say Hello I'd love tosee you there and we're actually verylucky to have Lauren here because sheruns the community and so we thought itwould be a great opportunity to havesomeone from our training certificationand also the community here it's a greatresource we were talking about thisearlier that people come here after youknow after you feel you know everythingas an administrator you join the realworld and all of a sudden you get thoseuser questions or how to do things thisis a great place to go before you readeven document okay now last thing I'llsay is after you pass your certificationthere's a space in the community forLearning and certification specificallywhere you can share hey I passed we'llcongratulate you recognize you shareyour tips and help others as they'repreparing for the certification as wellso bragging rights are definitelyencouraged exactly so let's go a littledeeper into the exam guidance into thevarious topics as I mentioned there arefive specific areas and those of youlike that like to know this stuff isavailable online did I click over allthe slides we're showing you are comingfrom the ongoing the online exam guideandlet's see did it open that up yes and itactually gives you a lot of detail we'rejust going to tough touch the surfacebut on managing objects objects meansthings like users calendar events thingslike that in groups it actually goeseven deeper than we're going to go herebut I do want to go through this withyou all so let's talk aboutobject management I know that soundsvery impersonal but there's a lot ofthings that you manage in the adminconsole so in addition to users there'salso calendar resources who knows what acalendar resource isanybody want to tell me one linermeeting rooms exactly exactly exactly sowe're not talking about just managingpeople's calendars and maybe you havecalendars that are like shared projectsbut also you have meeting rooms eventspaces that you might want a trainingroom for example the Executive Suite mayhave tighter security than otherresources also you you want to set upyour groups to reflect your organizationsome people are also using groups forsecurity access control so that's veryimportant some of you may or may not beusing shared drives and then finally wethink it's important to remember some ofyou may be working with multiple domainsmaybe you have different subsidiaries inyour company or that's how you managesome of your securitythe other five of the five resourceareas of uh Focus assessment are servicemanaging services so services are inaddition to the core services like Gmailand calendar maybe there's additionalservices that you're that you want toenable as well well so for example youmay have contractors and maybe you don'twant them to have access to all of theGoogle services and but maybe foreveryone else in your company you do sosetting up policies around servicesum also a very important topic istroubleshooting most of the assessmentand training around troubleshooting isaround mail delivery because this iswhat most users are experiencing as wellas Access Controland I'll just jump in here to say thattroubleshooting is some of the mostcommon topics that we do see in thecommunity so there are the commonquestions common troubleshooting butthere are also Niche scenarios where youmight be experiencing a similar issue ora scenario as someone else and bysharing that helping solve each other'sproblems and working together withinthat you can help each other out and andmake Solutions and and solve thoseproblems in the community together yeahgreat I know I use this for Google andalso if anyone's worked with otherproducts I always go to the communityfirst before I try to read the some ofthe documentation and then I think thisis the last of the five topics of coursesecurity access control authenticationare you going to turn all multi-factorauthentication are you using singlesign-onDLP is data loss protection data leakageprotection you know do you want toconfigure some of those policies throughGmail as well as as well as throughDrive okay so those are the five majorareas of assessment oh and then finallyexcuse me this is the fifth one it'searly in the morning I can't count yetis uh supporting business initiativesand this is for example Google Vaultdoes anyone know what vault isgo ahead anybody just shout it outokay some people think of it an archiveand it's more along the lines of dataretention policies how long do you wantGoogle to retain your data maybe youhave compliance policies this is animportant thing to be aware of becausemaybe not all of you are using theGoogle Vault service but there will besome questions around that okay andactually we're going to go through someof the common questions that we getquestions about and we'll see what'scovered what isn't covered on the exambut you will do the first expectation isthat you may be there may be thingsyou're not using that are available inworkspace and but they may be covered onthe exam so that's why looking at theexam guide is very important it givesyou a sense of what's going to becovered okayum very good so let's go through someexam tips okay so as I mentioned bothLauren and I have been through this examas well as others so the first thing isjust become familiar with the feature ofthe product that you're being tested onI know that sounds pretty Elementary butyou'd be surprised we have people thatjust want to get yet anothercertification so be you know be aware ofthis especially if you're really anadministrator and we have a lot of thattraining available for you and also ifyou're new to this make sure that youexplore some of the features in theadmin console if you see something newmaybe explore that a little bit moreand uh now we're going to go into thearea of now that you've you're takingthe exam what are some of ourrecommendations so as I mentionedearlier for a lot of people you alreadyknow this stuff but you just get nervoustaking the exam so my first tip isremember to breathe remember you have120 Minutes for this it may not soundlike a lot of time but it is a lot oftime okay so the first thing we werecommend is read the question make sureyou understand the question and when wewalk through one or two examples you'llsee they're usually structured thatthere's a scenarioyou know here's the situation what wouldyou now do here's the task that you needto do okay so think about what you'rebeing asked okay you're not necessarilybeing asked to recreate the scenariobecause it already exists but what is itthat you're actually being asked to dofocus on what's the questionum as I mentioned it's they're allmultiple choice and then if you don'tknow the answer right away what werecommend is eliminate the ones that youknow are absolutely wrong as we're goingto do what that does is it frees yourbrain from all those distractors asthey're called so you can just focus onoh maybe these one of these two areright maybe reread the question againbecause I I want to let you know thatone of those is the right answer okaymay not be the one that you think wouldbe the right answer but you got it oneof those is the best answer that's how Ilook at it okay and if you're stillstuck what we recommend is Mark thequestion for review so that you canbookmark it because what happens is whenyou're done with the 50 60 Questions thefirst time it presents a page that listsall the questions again and the onesyou've bookmarked have an asteriskso if you're feeling stuck go back tothose at the end so try to get throughall of the questions once your bestattempt bookmark the ones that youreally are stuck with and then come backto those and review them and the otherthing I want to do is don't overthink ituse common sense some of you may becoming from an A more technicalbackground maybe integrationthose are not the type of questionsyou're going to have here so don't overanalyze the question one of them is thebest answerokay so at a very high level those areour recommendationsokayso let's go through uh two samplequestions I think we're doing good withtime yep okay so as I mentioned this isa very classic type question wherethere's a scenario on top I'm not goingto read this out loud you're welcome toread thisand then notice the second half isactually the question you've been taskedwith creating 80 new accounts from alist you receive from the director ofThe Intern program what is the minimumyou need you must do to create theaccounts segmented away from anyemployee accountsso there's a couple of interestingkeywords there the minimum you need todo okay uh create accounts segmentedawayso we don't want to say create aseparate org right but that's what it'sindicating there from the rest of youremployee accounts okay so really readthis scenario but the question is reallywhat you're being askedand once again we'll share thesematerials with youand then in this case this is not a realquestion it may have been an old onethat we pulled and now you have whatfour options hereokay so I'm going to be silent for amoment let you read those optionshopefully people can read thoseand you may get the answer right awaywhich is finemaybe you don'tuncomfortable silenceokay I'm just going to go ahead so a wasthe right answer okay but we're alsogiving you Clues as to why b c and dwere actually wrong okay so we'vehighlighted so with B create anorganizational unit with activedirectoryso it specifically says in the scenarioyou're not using active directory rightisn't that what it says OkayC is wrong enter the interns in thecolumn org unit path but you have tocreate the organization firstokay so with if you're working when youdo the upload the bulk upload it doesn'tcreate the organizational unit for youyou have to create that one first soeven though you put that in the columnto identify the organizational unit ifit doesn't exist it'll generate an errormessage okay and once again anythingrelated to active directory we're notwe're not using that here the whole ideawas you're creating these users you'remanaging them separately or directlywithin workspaceokayso cool Sorry to walk by you there noand just as you're transitioning to thesecond question I do want to call outthat on that certification home pagethat we've been coming back to andthat's also listed as a resource in yourevent app with this session there are anumber of other sample questions thatyou can test yourself test yourknowledge get an understanding of whereyou may need to study a little bitfurther yepI'll be your demo Dolly hereand we're going back here hopefully thatrefreshed up there there are reviewsample questions you can do here itactually uses a Google form and you canretake these sample exam as many timesas you want okay now my I want to giveanother tip here on since you mentionedthis thank you is that I have foundusing this isn't just a way of gaugingyour knowledge but like I said a lot ofus are not used to taking exams it's agreat way of just getting into that modeof reading a question trying to answermultiple choices so it's really good tosort of like retrain yourself almost onthat process okay so don't just think ofit as do I know the answer I'm ready forthe exam it gives you some practice inthat mode of multiple choice questionsI've even had people say I'm just goingto set a timer for one minute for eachquestion so that you can learn how topace yourself because I will admit thatI think the hardest part of any of ourcertification exam is those emotionallockers and the stress factor in doingthat because really you probably knowthis if you studied it okay we all justget really nervous like we are right nowup hereokayum so we do have one more samplequestion there we go uh so once againthey're the first part of the questionis a scenario recently sensitiveresearch information was accidentallyshared with an unauthorized vendor viaGoogle Drive by a member of one of yourresearch teams at symbol Health the CEOhas asked you to revisit the GoogleDrive settings to Titan securityokay so the real question is howevercollaboration with several partnercompanies that are involved in drugdevelopment cannot be impaired so thepartner companies are also using Googleworkspace what configuration changesmust be made to Google Drive settings inthe admin console to improve securityposture of symbol labs so there's a lotof stuff in therethat's probably why it's no longer inthe exam we have tried to simplify someof the questions a little bityou know especially if English is notyour first languageokay by the way the exam is onlyavailable in English and Japanese rightokayso once again we do try to make them alittle bit simpler to read especially ifyour English is your second language oryou know anyway so here are the optionsthat you have A B C or D I'll give you amoment to read thosemaybe you got it right away maybe you'reeliminating a fewI'm glad we have the answers up hereokayand this one the answer is actually C solet's see what that says so from GoogleDrive sharing settings card add thepartner companies Google workspacedomains to the allow domain listokay so in Google workspace you have theability to sort of limit which companydomains that you're able to share withand you can set that up also byorganizational unitso you could have it company wide or youcould set it up with certain departmentscan only communicate with certainexternal domains we see this also verycommon with education I think we used tocall it I think we called it thegreenhouse effect where you have anorganization for just your students andfor your faculty and who can thestudents communicate with might berestricted whereas maybe the faculty cancan communicate with anyone internallyor externally so a lot of companies askfor this type of functionalityokay very effective if you're workingwith vendors in particular maybe youwant to limit who can work with whatwhen which which vendors based upontheir domainsokaycool so now we're going to go through acouple of uh common questions that wesee though these are planted and then wewill open them up to everyone elsedirectly from the community and we'vepulled the ones that we see most oftenbut we'll be sure just after this to getto any questions that you have so pleasehold on to those so our first questionis is there a fee for the certificationand yes it is 200 and this is listed onthe certification home page which islinked here and again that resource isin the event app if you haven't checkedthat out yet but as a fast follow oursecond question isthere we gois there any vouchers or discounts thatyou can receive for taking thecertification and the answer is yes itdoes depend so a couple of differentoptions that we recommend if you are aGoogle Cloud partner we encourage you totake advantage of the partnercertification Kickstart program this isan online training program to help youprepare for the certification and onceyou complete a number of requiredactivities and going through the coursesthen we'll send you a voucher to takethe certification at no cost so Partnersplease do check that out but an excitingopportunity for you here as a GoogleCloud next attendee is that forattendees with a three day pass youqualify for innovators plus so if youhaven't heard of this this is asubscription that comes with a host ofbenefits one of which is a freecertification voucher to take the examthere's also another benefit where youcan have 500 at credits to Google Cloudskills boost which Barry has beenmentioning to get hands-on experienceand prepare for the exam so this QR codehere and also that link you see on theslide is how you can activate yourinnovators Plus subscription if youhaven't already and if you're having anyquestions about that process don't don'tgo unanswered please meet us in theinnovators Hive and the innovators teammyself Barry or the community team willbe happy to set you up and make surethat you can take advantage of thosebenefits great and by the way thatvoucher is valid for any certificationexam so Cloud digital leader yay I leadthat program or workspace or any of theother Google Cloud platformcertifications okay coollet's see oh I get to do the next one solet's see what the next question is canwe choose our language so we've alreadyanswered that the answer is yes yourchoices are English or Japanese andum when does the certification uh expirethat's a very common question so it'sgood for for two years you'll benotified through Criterion remember onceagain that's that third party uhresource that we use for exams for allof our exams and they will notify youokay based upon the email that you setup for the certification one of theother common questions we get is whatemail address do I have to use so youcan actually identify here's myCorporate email but you could also useyour personal Gmail account okay becausewe all know why we want to do that rightokay coollet's see what's the next one ahso this one is what is the preparing forworkspace admin Journey courseand when do you recommend taking it wellif you were paying attention in thebeginning we talked about that that is acourse it's sort of just take it in thebeginning right before you get startedon your Learning Journey they'reavailable in all of our certificationprograms and it sort of helps you tofigure out what's going to be coveredmaybe I'm ready in certain areas itreally is there to help you identifywhat we call you know knowledge gapswhere do I really need to focus myattention in studying so we recommendtaking that in the beginningum okay what level of detail do we needto understand Google Cloud directorysync okay or Google Suite password syncon the examso these are services or or migrationtools that customers use that areworking with active directory you knowmaybe you're a large company you'restill managing your users and resourceson active directory but you also wantthat to be automatically synchronized inG Suite okay so you don't need to know alot of details of it but you need tounderstand what it does maybe some ofits limits so there will be a couple ofyou know there might be a question onthere about it I recommend even if younever use it you want to beknowledgeable about this but it is atool that exists outside of the adminconsoleso customers may want to add do you mostof their user management and groupmanagement and active directory GoogleCloud directory sync will synchronizewhat's there and add and delete usersbased upon those policies in G Suite Imean in workspace okay the same thingwith passwords maybe you want to manageall your passwords in active directoryand you want those reflected in Googleworkspaceand before covering this next questionis just on active directory we do have alive session coming up with thecommunity that's focused specifically onusing Google workspace with activedirectory and with Azure so please ifyou are interested in learning moreabout that check that event out in thecommunity so our next question is alsoabout what is covered on the exam so doyou need to have knowledge of appsscript for the exam so similarly youshould have an understanding of whatapps script is when you should use itand why it's valuable however it'sunlikely that you're going to have toread or understand apps script itself sowe do have a resource here that werecommend you check out and be familiarwith that's the admin SDK APIdocumentation but again just make sureyou understand how and when it'simportant to use apps script and whenyou might want to use it and if youreally are interested in it we actuallyhave some Hands-On Labs using it as wellso you can add on a little bit ofworkflow or functionality with within umyour your workspace user experienceamazing so this question again if youhave been listening is there any type ofquick lab environment where I can gethands-on experience without impacting myproduction environment and the answer isyes so that is Google Cloud skills boostso that's a series of Hands-On Labs thatyou can take without impacting your ownenvironment or your own accounts andit's a great way to get that experienceand you can also earn a skilled badge sowith that if you're taking the Hands-OnLabs you can earn that skill badge shareit on your socials and it's a great wayto document and to solidify thatexperience and that knowledge thatyou've gainedand by the way if you're activating thatinnovator plus you know subscription wetold you about these are a great handyou can do all the labs you want to doyou know during the duration of thatsubscription so once again if you'recurious we feel we believe in continuouslearning even it's not covered on theexam it's great to know this stuff okayoh there I am so once this goes alongthe line the additional third-partytools so gam is um this what does itstand for it stands for Google AppsManager okay so this is a littlescripting tool that's been around for along time I remember from 15 years agoum you don't need to know about this butit is a cool tool to know aboutum it back actually uses in the back endit's a scripting language that sort oflets you automate certain operationsbecause it uses the back end workspaceapis to do operations for you you haveto authenticate yourself before you usethe tool but it's really cool but youdon't need to know anything about it forthe exam okayand let's see how many more oh so thisother one yep I think this is our lastone and then we'll open it up for Q a sohave your questions ready so what is thedifference between Google Cloud Learningpath that's on Google Cloud skills boostand then Coursera or pluralsight sogreat question these courses are thesame across each of the platforms butthe one difference is that Google Cloudskills boost element with the Hands-OnLabs which is only available through theGoogle Cloud Learning path experienceand that's how you can earn thoseofficial skill badges so at the end ofthe day it's ultimately up to you whichplatform that you choose but that isjust keeping in mind that considerationwith the skill Badges and Hands-On labsand the innovator stuff innovator Plussubscription is going to work withGoogle Cloud skills boost just to letyou set that as an expectation exactlyexactly cool so that's the end of ourcan questions I think we wanted to justdo a quick wrap up and then we'll openit up to person so you know we'vecovered everything we still have abouteight more minutes but we don't want toforget any of these resources exactlyyep so we'll just take one more minuteto share these are a summary of theresources that we've covered and touchedon today again if you are snappingphotos you can look them up but alsothey're in your event app so in theresources section with your um with thissession so that first one is the onethat we've been coming back to for mostof today's session it will link out tomany of the other resources that we'vebeen talking about so if you come awaywith one resource today that should bethe one and then I think we just haveone more slide about what's next afterthis session so if you have anyadditional questions after today you canmeet us the learning and certificationteam the community team the workspaceproduct team in innovators Hive and we'dbe happy to have a conversation meet youand answer any additional questions ofcourse check out the other workspacesessions and then of course I'd love tosee you join the community if youhaven't already with that QR codeum again don't be shy please say HelloI'd love to hear from you and greatresource for follow-up questions or anyissues you're having as well and thenfinally at Google we say feedback is agift so we definitely want to get yourfeedback if you have the Google next appinstalled on your phone it's um it'svery easy to get access to the onlinesurvey so with that we want to thank youthank youforeign"
