Deepak Chauhan I look afterthe Google Cloud business unit based outof London for emea and APAC it's adedicated ecosystem unitand uhwe've been we had the privilege of beingthe luminary sponsors this year we areat booth number triple one three forthose of you have not seen us or or notbeen with us or not Don't Know About Uswe've had a exciting Journey since thelast three years since Inception sincewe formed this unitGoogle Cloud unit at HCL has been thetop two units recognized not only byanalysts but also by Google Cloudthemselveshas to be the top two units uh in termsof the ecosystem units that we haveestablishedwe work across a number oftransformation programs across somethree of 350 programs that we havedelivered globallyand we also are very excited to announcethat we have been selected as theexpansion partner of the year as ofyesterday and also when a social impactaward yesterday so two Awards and thisis the fourth awardsuccessively in four years we have beenselected as the

where my heart livesandas I welcome them on stagelet me introduceDavid Omani the CEO of Allstate a bankgroupand also Christoph helm the CIA of FirstBank groupplease welcome them on stage[Applause][Music]so us just to before we kick offI just wanted to do a quick introductionof our guests hereDavid is the group CEO of First Aidgroup and he's a self-described I.Tperson he has been working in thebanking industry since 1985 and and inthe Central and Eastern European regionfor over 30 yearsas a group CEO David is leading thedevelopment of I.T and Associated dataservices to build the best in classbanking services and experiencesfor all of us these clients across theregionand I've personally seen what he's beendoing there David believes that theadaptation of cloud technology and theresponsible use of data will enable thevision of the segment of oneallowing the group to tailor itsproducts and services for each and everyindividual client and we'll hear fromDavid in more detail about some of thatlet me come to you Kristoff and I've hadthe privilege of working very closelywith youand your passion to drivethe whole transformation Journey hasbeen infectious I must sayChristoph is the CIO of first a groupbank and managing director of fosterdigitalin his role he's driving the TechnologyInnovation of first day groupand uh and is responsible for the cloudtransformation programChristopher's many years of experiencein banking and before he joined as agroup he was working at Uni credit bankin Austria not Australiahe believes that technology will helpthe banks to increase the speed ofchange from core banking systemmodernization to customer Journeys thatare supported by artificial intelligenceand those are some of the very importanttopics that we'll cover today so withoutfurther Ado gentlemen I would like towent I would like to introduce you andask you to please take the session fromhere David Omani[Applause]so good morning uh I think we're luckyto have a morning session I alwaysprefer to have an alert and brightaudiencetheyI want to just tell you a little bit ofuh background about Who We Areand I'm going to start with a historylessonbecause Arista group was founded 204years agolet's put that in contextNapoleon Bonaparte was sitting in SaintHelensand Louis XVI was on the throne inFrance George III was 10 years insanebut still the king of England and JamesMoore was the fifth President of the U.Sand you were 40 years away from electingAbraham Lincolnand we founded a bankand we founded a bank in order toprovide banking services to all in thecommunityit's grown since thenwe're in across central eastern Europewe're number one in Austria we're numberone in the Czech Republic we're numberone in Slovakia we're number three inHungary in Romania in the Czech Republicand we're also in the country such asSerbia Montenegro Bosnia NorthernMacedoniaand the bank has maintained what it setout to do 204 years ago in order toprovide banking services across theregion to all of the people that need itlike any long and older Bank we haveLegacy I.Tnot still from1819 but from some years ago and we'llgive you an update today in terms of howwe're approaching the modernization ofthat I.Twe're a universal Bank 16 millionclients 55 of our revenues come fromretail 45 from corporate and treasury uhvery stable very very very good bank anda good bank because we're in the rightcountries and we've got the rightbusiness modeland the challenge is now not just tomaintain that but to take it forwardhow did the strategy evolvein terms of the I.Tfour years ago we were hereand we were working with the cloudservice providers still trying tounderstand what do we do with the cloudwhy why should we use the cloud what'sthe benefit we were not clear four yearsagothanks in generalare not the first movers but we try tobe the first followersand it's not because we're lazy and it'snot because we're scared but we do havea very very intensely regulatedenvironmentand as I just mentioneddata protection Dora Cloud act EU IAIActwe have to be very very clear and verycareful in taking these topics forwardand we've got to be very careful interms of our asset and why we aresuccessful and we continue to besuccessful is the trust of the clientso we got to make sure we have the dataprotected we've got to make sure thesystems work we've got to make sure thatwe can take these items forward so wevery quickly realized Cloud can help usfirstly on the standards so the standardbeing scalability I don't think we needto go into that detail we've understoodthis and we can use thatthe security details that we have inplace we could never afford to generateand develop these on our own it's likewe don't have our data centers becausewe use data center companies we use thesecurity aspects in the cloudenvironment which arevital but also developing quicker thanwe could ever do thiswe use it in terms of the technologybecause there's Cloud native technologythat is definitely a huge benefit to usand finally because and it's not acliche it is all about the people if wewant to get people to work on ourtechnologythey expect us to be able to providethese services so we work with that inthose termsare we goingsothree years ago anybody standing on thestage here spoke about digitalizationand digitalization and digitalization ofcourse we're doing thiswe have a strategy in terms of ourtechnology always thinking first clientimpact how is the client going to usethis how will the client benefit how dowe direct this in the client so thestrategy is mobile first for retailstrategy is everything available andready 24 7 to the clients not just theretail clients but also our corporatesonlineand the strategy is standardization ofthe products where possible through thechannelsand specialization and advice in ourbranches so we double and we dovetail onthesewe have a strategy and I go back to whatI mentioned at the beginning aboutFinancial Healthwe started out giving our services andmaking sure we can provide theseservices to all our peopletoday the strategy is clearly to be ableto enable Financial Healthfor our client basewhat does that meanthis isn't touchy-feely this is when theclient needs the service when the clientneeds the product we should be able toidentify this we should be able to bringit to them so we work onwhat was mentioned at the beginning the17th of one and I believe in the segmentof onebanking segments clientsyou have retail in retail you have massmass affluent privatebut we can use the technology availableon dataon analytics on AI but everythingunderpowered by the cloud technology todevelopthe segment of one the segment of one isthat real time we can go to eachindividual client and provide them whatwe see are the services necessaryon our approach to Cloud three itemsfirstly we have a multi-cloud strategymulti-cloud service providerthis isn't because we like one or wedon't like the other or we don't trustthem but it was inevitable that we woulduse all threeand we work with Microsoft we work withAWS and we work at Googleand the reason we're using themulti-cloud strategy isto make and benefit from the best of allprovidersbut also vendors have better setups ondifferent cloud services we need to dothatthe challenge that we have is to makesure that when we have Cloud to Cloudapplicationsthat this is going to work so that's onethat we're leading into at the momentand we'll get a little bit more detailon thaton Googlewe're working intensely with Google inAustria at a group level and theAustrian level on what we call our I.Ttransformationas I mentioned the it Legacy isn't from1819 but we do have 70s Mainframe itworks we'll get rid of it we have oldersystems which are not available to bedeveloped because we need to be able tobring the services quicker we need to beable to bring the services online andwe've got the architecture in place butwe need to refactor and redevelop alarge large school Power platforms sowe're working with Google on this mycolleague Christopher will give you anupdate on thatto round off just in the introductionI do have a wish to Google we're workingwith HCL on the actual transformationprogrambut my wish to Google is when we'reworkingwe got to work not just as partners andyou're not doing this just once becausethe banks are regulated everywhere withthe same regulations so let's try to dothese things together that we don't haveto reinvent these for every client andmake sure we get that done properlyon that we'll come back witha q chance to ask some questions and notjust on the history and I'd like to givethe floor to my colleague ChristophER[Applause]thank you David and within the nextcouple of minutes I want to share withyou why we believe Cloud will help us inmodernization of our I.T landscape inorder to become faster and react quickerto changes because as we all know it'snot the bigger ones that will survivebut it's the those ones which reallyreact fast to changes and I hope in 200years time our group CEO will still bestanding here then and speaking aboutour long historywhen speaking about the I.T applicationlandscape and the Legacy many of youwill have uh this picture that you seehere on the left side may sound familiarto you it shows a heavily overloadedshipcarrying a lot of loadbut to say something positive this shipis also very efficient because given thesize of the ship everything is neatlypacked to that there is no free spacethings are added and attached to thechip in a very efficient way andprobably you will need the captain tochange anything if you lose the captainyou are doneI like this picture because it describesvery well some of the areas of ourapplication landscape it's efficient butit's not ready to change quickly andit's even bearing some operational riskthis is why we all look intothe left sideumyour right side the container ship wherewe have really a scalable fast shipwhere we have standardized containers wewe can scale and we can carry much moreload in the futurein order to understand that problembetter why are we stuck on that ship andwhy are we not moving faster we spoke toour people we spoke to our I.T teams tounderstand really the problem because Ithink cloud is a technology uh in thefirst place will come later then to seethat it is also changing theorganization but understanding theproblem and what problem you want tosolve that's probably a good startingpoint so speaking to our people speakingto the it experience we find a couple ofinteresting problems that we have tosolve you see the first group of peoplewho said well there's a lot of manualwork we still have with our deploymentwith our testing so we're missing allthese automated cicd proceduresthen we have people who said there is somuch new technology out there newversions to test and we don't have thespace the environments to test thiswe also have solutions that have quitevolatile peak times workloads to toconsume in both directions so scaling upand also reducing them because if youthink about non-productive environmentslike test environments they are not usedall the time so being able to rent themdown is also something that that we arelooking for and finally this is probablythe most interesting thing andforward-looking thing it's thosebusiness demands set out there and we dohave our business colleagues who and wesee here on the conference already AIChennai is the best example that youwant to apply immediately and this wouldnot be possible if you don't have cloudservices in-house and you're familiarwith these servicesso understanding the problem was mymoment when I understoodCloud can be a solution to ourmodernization problem and we havestarted a larger program I think it wasback in 2021 2022 and we've started withthe application assessment we looked atour application landscape and said wheredo we find those applications that Ihave shown you before where do we havethose problems that had two advantagesfirst we identified those areas where wehave I don't want to say the low hangingfew fruits but we are gaining the biggerscale and second we focus you can't boilthe ocean we cannot transform everythingto the cloud David mentioned we stillhave the Mainframe we have a lot ofOracle databases that are difficult tomigrate currently so there have beensome platforms that we took out of thescope and ended up finally with roughlya hundred applications that we need wantto migratehaving that done having a clear scope welooked who can help us on this and I'mjumping a little bit this middle partand we'll come back to thetransformation part uh in a secondwe immediately jumped on okay now weunderstood the problem let's do it let'sengineer it and we looked for partnersbecause we also we understood we arealone we cannot do this at scale andwith the necessary speed the partners wefound is uh HCL and Google and at thatpoint I want to say a big thank you forthe support that you are giving us inthat Journey the reason why we selectedthese two as as partners is becausefirst of all they understood ourregulatory environment and there isstill a lot of things to do second theyunderstood our people that we need tochange also the people we need to workdifferently and third large companiesthey have a lot of resources a lot ofcapacity a lot of experience and this isalso what helps us to get fasterI'm coming back now to thistransformation part and when I saidbefore this was my moment when Iunderstood the problem this is mylessons learnedwe jumped immediately to the executionwhich is good and we built the lendingZone and we will migrate the firstSolutions this yearum but what I would do differently if Iwould start this project once again Iwould start earlier to involve people tothink about this transformationalaspects on how this Cloud transformationwill also change your organization willchange the processes we'll change thejob roles that you have in yourorganization so that's at least 50 ofthe project fifty percent is thetechnology part and 50 is theorganizational part and that's mypersonal learning that I want to sharewith you start with thesetransformational thing with the mindsetthing as early as possible not only forthe it but also for the business peoplenoahI want to change where uh I want toclose with uh summarizing the benefitsthat we are measuring and what we wantto get out of this transformationprogramand this can be grouped in in three uhareas first it says increase value formoney cloud is not a cost savingexercise we had a lot of Consultantshereum in the beginning that said you willsave 30 of the of your costs they arenot here anymore but what we see is thatwe can get more for our money in[Music]making a lot of fixed costs that we havein making them to variable costs youhave seen that we are looking also onthose solutions that have peak timesthat uhchanging in in terms of capacityconsumptions uh so here Cloud will helpus to turn our costs more into avariable pathsecond and that's the qualitative aspectbehind this uh first topic is of coursewe all know scalability and flexibilitythis is something that drives us day byday we have solutions that are growing20 30 even year on year in terms ofcapacity consumptions to keep up withthis uh in a very fast and efficient waycloud is definitely the solution and 50of our Solutions have this uh or thesolutions that are in scope of themigration have this kind of behaviorand last but not least and this isclosing the loop to what I said in thevery beginning why we are doing Cloudbecause we want to get faster we want toreact faster to changes it's this timeto Market currently we see that still uhquite a high number of our Solutionshave quarterly deployments and evenlonger because of the thert complexarchitecture that we have because of theLegacy that we havewe are targeting to deploychanges to the solution in less than amonth so on a monthly base not to saybi-weekly base I'm not saying daily itis also not working because we stillhave a hybrid scenario uh but reducingthis deployment uh frequencyum is is probably the one thing uh thatat the end will make us faster in thedeploymentum this is why I think cloud story is amodernization but especially gettingfaster and this is the the titlesupercharging meaning charging fast wasa nice fit uh to our presentation andwith this I would like to hand over todebug again thank you very muchthank you David and thank you Kristoffthat was a really insightful session[Music]foreign"
