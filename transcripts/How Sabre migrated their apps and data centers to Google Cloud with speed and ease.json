hope you can take lessonslearned from their migrations to yourown migrations to Google Cloudmy name is Heather Remick and I'm theglobal head of the rapid migrationprogram or ramp for short here at GoogleCloudand I'm going to kick off the sessionwith an overview of the ramp programwe'll then transition to a fireside chatwith Joe defonzo the CIO of saber andStephen Orbin the VP of migrations hereat Google cloud and then finally we'llclose it out with a live q a session sothe ramp program unifies our migrationapproaches tools Frameworks and teams ona unified and scalable Global programand it's designed to give customers andpartners everything they need toevaluate and execute large-scalemigrations to Google Cloudincluding how to assess people processand Technology readiness and buildingthe ramp program we've taken keylearnings from over a decade ofmigrations both successful and some notso successful and streamlined the bestpractices and approaches under thisunified migration program making it evenmore comprehensive than beforewe're also working closely with ourpartner ecosystem to onboard them to theramp program including utilizing theramp governance mechanisms we've put inplace to complement their existingdelivery models to help ensure migrationstart and end healthyoops I'm hitting the wrong button Idon'tin our experience from helping hundredsof customers through their migrationswe've also learned There's anopportunity to help customers build aflywheel effect within theirorganizationfirst we are our partners help customersquantify a business case and driveconsistent stakeholder alignment we thenhelp them set up Cloud foundation and aramp plan that identifies andprioritizes the workloads to migratefollowing this preparation and planningstage we help them migrate validate andsunset the old which is a very criticalstepum so that customers can start torealize the efficiencies of moving tothe cloudand lastly we help them Implementtransformational operating models sothey can continuously optimize what'sbeen moved Done Right the learnings andexperiences gained from migratingworkloads compound over time to helprefine the business case bolster thefoundation accelerate subsequentmigrations and make it easier tooptimize workloadsand to create this flywheel effect we'veanchored ramp on five key best practicesand we tend to see these best practicesin customers who are successfullypulling off large migrations and wefound that if any of these bestpractices are missing or deficient themigration will either stall or failcompletelynow the first best practice is having abusiness case and having executiveExecutives aligned on the business casethis is essential to the success of themigration and a good business case willhave a handful of clearly definedreasons why a migration will benefit theorganization ideally articulating morethan just the total cost of ownershipImprovementthe second is a learning culturebecause moving to the cloud requiresdifferent ways of working teams need tobe enabled on both the new technologyand the new ways of working too often wesee high-level Executives overlookingthis in the beginning and some feeltheir teams will just get the migrationdone because they're told to do so butfrom our experience it doesn't usuallywork that wayteams need to be enabled on how theywill work in the cloud and there's nodoubt you already have amazing teamsacross your organization so utilizingyour existing Talent who have a wealthof institutional knowledge about yourcompany and your culture will help yoube successful in the cloudand to enable and drive these learningsthe third is a cloud Center ofExcellence or Cloud team or whatever youwant to call the team but this teamshould include a diverse background ofroles and the team should own and managethe landing Zone and should Harvest anddisseminate the best practices as theorganization's Cloud capabilities maturefor example when I was a leader of thecloud team at Verizon not only were weresponsible for building out a hardenedEnterprise ready platform we were alsoresponsible for building and drivingCloud adoptionour Cloud team included folks fromnetwork security governance automationand collectively we ran a weeklycommunity of practice call to take TheAngst out of moving to the cloud bysharing Best Practices New automationsand shared learnings from across theorganization this was critical to oursuccess in driving Cloud adoption acrossthe EnterpriseI keep hitting the wrong button thankyou the next is okrs which is one of myfavorite okrs objectives and key resultsit's one of my favorites because I thinkit differentiates us from others we arevery intentional about okrs and believethey're instrumental to a healthymigrationmonitoring and managing a great okr thatoutlines in detail what you're trying toachieve for what purpose by when and whowill own it can make a significancedifference to a healthy migrationeven if some dates are missed having aline in the sand that everyone us youthe partneragrees with has almost magical alignmentproperties and provides Clarity foreveryone to March towards it and havingit written down and constantly measuringthe progress also makes it really easyto include in shareholder calls allhands and town halls so the executiveteam can keep a steady pulse on how theorganization is pressing towards theirstated goalsand the best practices and excuse me andthe last best practice is having strongprogram governance throughout themigration there should be a businessreview steering committee and weeklycheckpoints two mechanisms that we putin place as part of the ramp program arethe rep the ramp migration deck and theramp health checkthe migration deck is a single source ofTruth to track and manage the overallstrategy health and progress of amigrationand this new way of managing migrationswill help teams as well as Google andpartner teams align on strategy anddelivery and it provides better earlywarning signs to help detect andmitigate problems before they impactyour migrationwe currently run health checks for rampaccounts to help teams unblock issuesand to ensure both the partner andaccount teams have all the support theyneed to be successfulwe highly recommend you utilize thesemechanisms to hold weekly migrationchecks with your account team andpartner teamsnow while we certainly can't claim thathaving a strongbusiness case and executive alignmentcreating learning culture harvestinglearnings through a cloud Center ofExcellence having clearly defined okrsand implementing strong programgovernance will guarantee a successfulprogramand migrationwe can say that we've seen enoughmigrations that are missing one or moreof these best practices either stall orfail completelyso as you're working with your Googleand partner teams lean on them to helpyou implement these best practices inyour migration sooner rather than laternow Google has a lot of capabilities tohelp customers migrate we've got severaltools and we've got various programs toassess Readiness Partners to helpInvestments we can make but we didn'thave something that brought them alltogether to help our customers andpartners consistently land each of thebest practices I just outlinedso we're bringing all these capabilitiestogether creating new ones when we needto and wrapping it all inside our rapidmigration programwe're doing this through governancewhere we're enabling our account andpartner teams on ramp specificmechanisms to help drive a consistentgovernance model that provides apredictable view across a migrationall ramp migration engagements utilizethe migration deck and participate inhealth checks and we're enablingdelivery teams to do the same with ourcustomers we're also building out alibrary of first and third-party toolsto Aid in All Phases of migration usecases and working on Frameworks forthird-party tools to be ready to go whenwe need themand we're curating a partner ecosystembased on a bar we set where we'reconstantly monitoring to ensure ourpartners and our delivery Mark and ourdelivery migrations in a way that'sconsistent with what we know works bestwe're also working through a more robustincentive program to help customers dealwith the double bubble as you migrateworkloads to Google Cloudnow there are three key phases to asuccessful migration the first isassessment which looks at yourenvironment to understand what's in itand how things could move to build aramp plan and most importantly it takesa cross-functional view across businessoperations technology Financesecurity and compliance so we can planon training the right people help youget your Cloud team set up startthinking about okrs and making sure yourstakeholders are aligned we recommendoverly exhaustive assessments which cantake up to six months or more as thebusiness case can be increased inFidelity during the second phasenow the second phase is the foundationbuild phase where the landing Zone andthe ccoe are built are established andworkloads are moved we believe in amental model of customers learning bydoing so we want to avoid Landing Zonebuild outs that take 12 months or moreand are theoretical in practice becauseno applications are actually deployedagainst it we encourage our customers toset a goal of migrating 30 apps in 30dayssounds like a lot but it's not to ensurethey're driving the change managementneeded to become a cloud-first itoperationand in the third phase we work with ourcustomers to migrate in waves withstrong program governance over theduration of the migration a well-runmigration creates the flywheel effectwhere learnings and experiences gainfrom migrating workloads compound torefine the business case bolster thefoundation accelerate subsequentmigrations and make it easier tooptimize workloads over timeyou need to be truly using the cloud totake advantages of the of thetransformational and cost savingscapabilities it provides this is theoutcome ramp is ultimately trying toachieveforeignwe know from experience how challengingthe initial phases of a migration can beso I want to share a little bit aboutour new assessment capability we arepleased to announce the cloud capabilityassessment for ramp as the first step tobuild an outcome driven migrationstrategythe online assessment determines whereyou are in your migration journey andidentifies tangible actions acrossbusiness operational and Technologyareas that drive successful migrationsto Google Cloudwe're also providing a comprehensivePlaybook on how to execute rampassessments that will help Drivetangible outcomes and set yourorganization up for success for cloudfoundations and partners can LeverageThe Playbook to drive business andTechnical Discovery workshops and runspecific tooling to identify prioritizeworkloads that can be moved to GoogleCloudnow good processes and governance arecritical to a migration and so are thetools you'll use to plan and migrateyour workloads within the tooling arm oframp we have a first party to a firstparty service integrated into theconsole called migration Center whichprovides one place for you to accesstools best practices and data-drivenprescriptive guidance to guide youthrough business case developmentenvironment Discovery workload mappingmigration planning financial analysisFoundation setup and migration executionwith migration Center you have fullcontrol of your dataand who can access it a migration centercomplies with Google security andprivacy policies and best of all it'sfree to usenow no matter how large yourorganization no one wants to go througha modernization alone and a successfulCloud migration is a group effortleveraging experts across disciplinespart of ramp will rely solely onPartners who have achieved the datacenter modernization Specialists and orthe cloud migration Specialists this ison top of infrastructure specializationand achieving Premier Service partnerstatuswe are actively working across ourpartner ecosystems to onboard them toramp including the ramp mechanisms suchas the migration deck and health checkwith these trusted Partners you're ingreat hands and with ramp you'll be ableto find easily find the partner that isright for youso as Joe and Steven make their way tothe stage I want to share a quote fromone of our ramp partners that workclosely with saber on their migrationJourney you'll notice that the key themeis not technology it's all about thecultural successes beginning with theiropenness to New Perspectives adjustingtheir approaches as they learned theirprofound cultural transformation andtheir adaptability agility and capacityfor continuous improvement keep these inmind as you listen to Sabers migrationjourney and with that I'll turn it overto Joe and Steventhank you Heather thank you appreciateitas Heather mentioned my name is Stevenand I am a recovering CIOI always wanted to say that in front ofa crowd I hope to be there somedayin all seriousness 10 10 years ago I wasthe CIO but yeah 10 11 years ago I wasthe CIO at Dow Jones and led asignificant migration we went from 56data centers down to sixreallocated about 100 million dollars incosts from traditional I.T operations touh product development the thing I'mmost proud of is we went from just a fewsoftware releases a year to hundreds aweek by the time I left and then I spentthe last eight years after that at AWSleading their migration business as wellas starting their data Exchange in theirisv and Marketplace ecosystem before Ijoined Googlelast year to help us build the migrationdiscipline that that Heather largelyjust walked through and uh if it's onething that I've learned it's that a lotof the the challenges that customersface with large-scale transferTransformations and migrations are notjust technical as Heather talked aboutsome of these best practices it's it'salso bringing your people along creatinga learning culture harvesting the bestpractices and really standing up andbeing a leader to drive changemanagement I've also had the opportunityin in my travels over the last 10 yearsto work with hundreds if not more than athousand different cios and TechnologyRegulators is they've driven theirtransformationand I'm super lucky today to be joinedby Joe defonzo the CIO of saber who inmy opinion is one of the mostforward-thinking leaders and drivers ofchange agents if you will that I've hadthe opportunity to get to know and soJoe and I are going to be having aconversation to learn a little bit aboutsaber and their journey and some of theopportunities that they had some of thechallenges that arose and and how theyovercame them so Joe thank you so muchfor being here with us today maybeintroduce yourself for a couple minutesbeyond what I what I said we'll getstarted sure thanks for having me outStephen uh so again my name is Joedefonzo I'm the Chief Informationofficer at saber if you're not familiarwith saber we like to say you know webasically make travel happen we providethe systems that are underneath manyairlines and hotels and travel agenciesthat basically control all of the datathat goes around the whole travelecosystem and it's a very complex thingbefore I came to saber just a littlemore than six years ago I was in theTelecommunications industry for 27 yearsso I thought I knew complexity and so Igot to the travel ecosystem and then Ilearned a lot so it's a very interestingbusiness I like to say we were like thefirst SAS business ever dating back tolike the 1970s when we first deployingour technology inside of travel agenciesaround the world and different airlinesand of course it wasn't the SAS that youknow today because of the technologychanges back then it was a little bitmore complicated and a lot moreexpensive but we've been involving withthe technology ever sincecool well thanks again for being hereum so the systems that underpin all ofour travel seems pretty important peoplewant people want to get to be where theywant to go on time absolutely um youknow it's one of those things where howcan I say this you know one of my maingoals every day when I wake up is pleasedon't end up on CNN because you knowcertainly if our systems did have anykinds of major problems basically bringsall the Airlines and airports to a deadstop and it definitely makes the news soit's something that we don't like to seeand I'm happy to say that you knowcertainly since we've been making ourCloud migration our level of risk aroundthat has definitely dropped for a lot ofreasons I could talk about you know westarted this journey back in 2017 reallywhen I came into the company and startedlooking around and you know reallythought about what what kind of businessis this company in when I saw how muchenergy we were expending operating datacenters and networks all around theplanetand it really didn't seem correct to methat we weren't in this day and ageright when you have Cloud out there youknow we were not focusing on the problemof our business we had all of this focuson these base Technologies and quitequite honestly there's no way we weregoing to do those as well as a companylike Google could do them so one of thefirst things I did when I came in I saidwhy don't we look at potentially movingthis business to the cloud and of courseyou know everybody screamed and saidthat's impossible we could neverum you know and so it took someconvincing but that's that's really partof the journey and kind of have hintedat that with the you know the transitionstrategies and the things you have tothink about in the program but honestlywhen we looked at all the numbers and welooked at what was the gain actuallybeyond the numbers there was no way thatwe couldn't do this in this day and ageso we got the commitment of ourleadership we got we got the commitmentof our board of directors and basicallyembarked on the journey and haven'tlooked back yeah so what are what aresome of the things that you need neededto do so you had a a business case whereokay we're going to be able to save somemoney sounds like you're also going tobe able to you knew you were going to beable to add some resiliency into thebusiness and moving this direction howdid you go about having thatconversation with the CEO with the boardand to get all the executives on boardyeah it was rather interesting um youknow we had a lot of Legacy technologyit was a company that had grown up overmany years and constantly evolvingthings and growing and acquiring newbusinesses and that sort of thing so wehad a lot of pockets of differenttechnology all over the place and quitehonestly we were spending a lot ofeffort just keeping everything runningin a stable way and making sure thateverything was fairly secure but therewas a lot of overhead in the way we wererunning it so we started this wholething looking at it from a purely afinancial perspective honestly one ofthe little secrets here is that's whereyou really want to start and by the wayit was surprising because when I madethat assertion that hey we can run inthe cloud cheaper then we can run in ourown data centers I got a lot of pushbackfrom people on my own team that thoughtfor some reason like we could run a datacenter cheaper than Google couldI don't understand that but it it's trueright and it's something that you haveto work your way through because peopledon't really you know completelyunderstand the concept of TCO often andwhen you really look at all of the laborand all of the effort and all of theSupply Chain management all the contractriskEtc et cetera et cetera your inabilityto get you know uh you know the power ofscale right in in a single architecturein a single environmentum you know it's hard it's it's hard tosee sometimes the value that you'regoing to drive out of it but we startedwith that to say hey I think we can savea lot of money we put that out there wedid the analysis and said I I think wecan actually save significant back toyour point with what you did earlierum you know we we've actually takenhundreds of millions of dollars of costsout of our business by doing this andthe cost of avoidance was enormousbeyond that I mean it was incredible ifyou think about where our business wasgoing where it was growing right andwhat we're going to be dealing with inthe future so it started there that gotthe attention of the board in theleadership and we engage but I have totell youmyself and a lot of the technologistsworking with me in the company knew thatthe real big benefit was going to be atthe end of the line when we could reallystart operating as Cloud first companybecausespeed of development or security of ourinfrastructure you know the automationright that gets rid of toil all over theplace every day that you know thestability and standards we could youknow drive across the Enterprise bringsa value that's really actually hard tomeasure in dollars yeah so making sureyou had kind of a clear solid Financialcase and getting everybody to resonatewith that and leading into the fact thatat this day and age a cloud provider islargely going to be able to to operateon a much more efficient scale than thanyou are soum when you we start when you startedthe journey with Google you had a littlebit with another cloud provider and alot on premises and you ended up makinga pretty bold move to uh to to work youknow mostly with Google how did that howdid that transpire and what sort offactored into your decision to yeah sowhen we when we started um we reallystarted in Earnest late 2017 early 2018and we we took the attitude we don'tknow what we don't know and we saidlet's let's keep an open mind to youknow a a a a a different or you know aessentially a multi-cloud approach sothat we maybe we can get the bestbenefits from each of the differentCloud providersum we went down that path for a littleover a year and a half and what we foundwas that there was an awful lot ofoverhead trying to manage all of thedifferent infrastructures all of thedifferent apis all of the differenttools all of the different standards uhyou know and basically we were notreally seeing a major benefit of thatbecause maybe 10 years ago it would havebeen different but now we're seeing thatfrom a base perspective in terms of canyou run your business on it pretty muchall of the cloud from the major Cloudproviders could give us everything weneeded so what we actually did was wesaid wait a second do we really need allthe overhead of this multi-cloudapproach and for us it just didn't makesense and we we started talking with ourCloud providers and essentially lookedfor the cloud provider that was the mostable to work with us in the way wewanted to work saver is a veryengineering heavy company and we reallyresonated with Google on that front andGoogle was very interested in workingmore with us and basically we felt thiskinship and we were able to make a goodyou know deal with Google on this and webasically made a you know a decade-longcommitment to move everything intoGoogle right and we're very close tohaving done that now yeah well first ofall thank you for that commitment andthe trust that that goes along with itwe we of courseum really appreciate thatumit wasn't always smooth sailing once wekind of made that commitment to oneanother and started the migration andtalked to us about some of the theobstacles and how we overcame them so solet's start with the fact that when weannounced our agreement in early 2020literally like within two weeks of thatannouncement the pandemic struck now asyou can imagine for a company in thetravel industry that's a really big dealbecause the business just lurched to ahalt right all the planes stopped flyingpeople stopped traveling companies stopsending people for travel everybody wasafraid we were all quarantined et ceteraand it was a it was actually a moment oftruth because at that point right wecould have maybe backed off and saidlet's let's wait and see what happensbut interestingly when we kind of tookstock in the leadership team of what weneeded to dowe decided no we have to keep pushingforward on this because the pandemicwill endthe competition's not going to wait forus you know we need to plow ahead so weactually took advantage of that time tocontinue to move forward and this backto at this point this is the time thatwe did a lot of The Upfront foundationwork by the way which was a big learningfrom a previous Cloud experience becausewhat we found when we were going downthat multi-cloud path is we weren't soorganized and we were actually creatinglots of little Islands even within thesame cloud of different ways ofapproaching and implementing that cloudinfrastructure you think about thenetwork you think about security youthink about routing you think aboutfirewalls you think about you know evenjust the way you're deploying yourapplications and the Technologies you'reusing so you said you know we have tonot do that because we could end up witha situation that's not as advantageousas where we wanted and so we took thetime up front to get the foundationright and then we started building onthat and I really do believe that's whatled us you know move so quickly to thepoint where you know basically threeyears after that you know we'resignificantly moved into gcp and now youknow almost four years after that youknow we're almost doneyep that makes sense and how did youbring your your team along so we talkeda little bit about how you got yourexecutive team on board and then thepandemic hit and I can imagine thatbeing a you know a significant uh um uhmoment of reflection on on kind ofstrategy and what to do what about likethe individuals on your team and did youdid you have folks who were maybe alittle bit more apprehensive than othersand if so how did you how did you sortof yeah absolutely and and it wasdifferent things for different peoplesome people really just did not have theexperience in any kind of cloud-basedinfrastructure to have a level of trustand faith that we could make ourapplications which are like super highscale and super high availability youknow work properly in that environmenteffectively so there was some learningGap we needed to close there so one ofthe things we did was make sureeverybody got the training that theyneeded to come up to speed on G p andhow to use it and all the other tools weuse like terraform and things like thatyou know another part of it was justthis notion of how much work it wasgoing to be right to move theapplications in and a big challenge thatI think everybody faces in this when youcome in and move things into the cloudfor the first time is you're going tomake a lot of these decisions about howmuch time do I spend trying tore-engineer this application so thatit's more Cloud native versus how muchyou know time am I going to spend justtrying to get it over the the hump or Iget it over into the new environment wemade a pretty conscious decision thatfor the most part we're going to dominimal re-engineering in order to getinto Cloud more quickly and I I ampositive that that was the rightdecision at least for us becausebasically the bet we made was that onceyou get into Cloud it's going to be veryeasy to cycle quickly and solve theproblems and and so in in the firstiteration of a lot of the deployments ofthe app they weren't the most efficientin the cloudbut now that we're in the cloud we cancycle so much more quickly than we couldin the old environment that people Ithink are really surprised and I thinkin a lot of ways we're like way moreefficient right than than we ever werewhen we were operating in our Legacydata centers yeah I love that approachso it's training your teams take outthat sting of the fear of the uncertainand make sure they have the right skillsets to that was the biggest thing as amatter of fact the decision we made wastake our biggest application and put itin the cloud first because that gave usthe biggest bang for the buck and onceeverybody saw that that could run thereif that ended all the conversationsabout is it possible right and and itwas really I think a very good thing wewere lucky in the fact that thatapplication was well suited to you knowthis kind of migration but it wasdefinitely a risk so training Lighthousewin making sure you migrate quickly it'sfunny I think it's one of the trainingis one of the things that's most oftenoverlooked Heather talked about it alittle bit and it's one of the reasonswe emphasize it so uh heavily in rampand then I also see a lot of analysisparalysis where customers will get stuckin this well we have to modernizeeverything before we even considermoving into the cloud and the reality isthat that is just going to take a longtime that's correct and you have thecycle time one of the best umuh anecdotes I've seen her principlesI've seen and we've seen a couple ofcustomers do this now it's similar towhat you're saying where we havesomething called the two-week rule whereevery team once they start to to migrateat a particular application they havetwo weeks to finish it so you can dowhatever modernization or Cloud nativechanges that you would like to do butyou have to finish the migration in twoweeks to sort of keep everybody on pointwith velocityso um so you're a lot further ahead thanthat now now you've might not just yourbiggest application but dare I say mostof your applications have talked to meabout the so we've closed 15 datacenters now our last two physical datacenters on the path to closure by theend of this year and at that point wewill have everything in the cloud everysingle thing it's pretty amazing whenyou think about it and uh you know againthe benefits everybody sees them they'repretty obvious now at this point I thinkwe have somewhere around 40000 VMS running in GCE we have about 60000 containers running in gke we haveabout 40 terabytes of storage splitbetween block and bigquery yeah 15 datacenters and a lot of containers that's athat's a big deal congratulations it'shugeum anything before we maybe open it upto questionsyou know you know a lot more now thanyou did when you started what what whatwhat would you tell either the audienceor your your younger self uh who maybesome of the folks here who are justgetting started they should consideryeah here's what I would say if you'reon the fencedon't be dive in because there's reallyno excuse anymore I can tell you thatyou know and and I can now give directexperience with Google on this thecapabilities you need are there in thecloud to do whatever you want to do as amatter of fact we're doing more advancedthings than we could have ever done inour own data centers right now that wemoved to gcp the amount ofsimplificationstandardization Savings in the networkimproved security improve performanceimprove reliability it's just insane thekinds of things we've been able to doZone redundancy Regional redundancy inour applications using spanner to movedata around plan I mean it's just wecould have never done these thingsbefore so not only has our environmentgotten cheaper it's gotten orders ofmagnitude better and so uh what I'd sayis if you have any doubt please don'tplease talk to somebody who's beenthrough this because many companies havenow at this point and I guarantee youyou will be very glad that you took theplunge well everybody I time is the mostvaluable asset we all have uh and I knowyou're all busy thank you so much forgiving us your time this afternoon wereally appreciate you being here andlistening to us this afternoon thank youheather for for our opening and enjoythe rest of the showforeign"
